After more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys will aim to create doubts about the strength of evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and who served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\nTrump's 2024 trials: Where they stand and what to expect\n\nAfter the closing arguments are given, the judge will instruct the jury, likely Wednesday, on the law governing the case and the factors it can take into account during deliberations.

He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nREAD MORE: A law school professor explains what to watch for in Trump trial's closing arguments\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments Tuesday.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump.

Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments Tuesday.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal. Trump has denied a relationship with McDougal too.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they won't be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence -- and there were many. Judge Juan M. Merchan, for instance, fined Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election.

After more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys will aim to create doubts about the strength of evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and who served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\nAfter the closing arguments are given, the judge will instruct the jury, likely Wednesday, on the law governing the case and the factors it can take into account during deliberations. The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments Tuesday.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they won't be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence -- and there were many. Judge Juan M. Merchan, for instance, fined Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases Trump is confronting as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nWhere each Trump case stands Classified documents case Election interference Hush money scheme Georgia election indictment Civil cases Arizona election indictment Tags Dcc Wire Apmediaapi Trump Trial Jury Hush Money Stormy Daniels Indictments Legal Proceedings Juries Politics Trials Washington News General News U.s.

Trump has denied any sexual relationship.\n\nThe prosecution's star witness, former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, also testified that the former president was directly involved in the scheme and authorized the payments.\n\nThe defense, for its part, sought to discredit the witnesses, including by portraying Cohen as a serial liar. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to federal charges related to the secret payments as well as lying to the U.S. Congress.\n\nBut this week, Trump's team has nothing to prove or convince jurors of his innocence.\n\nTo avoid a conviction, they must convince at least one of 12 jurors that prosecutors failed to prove Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, which is the standard for criminal cases.\n\nThe defense can also argue one last time that Trump was more concerned with protecting his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it came to the hush money that was paid.\n\nFormer Trump lawyer Michael Cohen was the prosecution's star witness. [Eduardo Munoz/Reuters]\n\nWhat should the jury decide?\n\nWhile courtroom drama has dominated media coverage of the trial, the case boils down to whether Trump knowingly concealed a $130,000 payment to Daniels for his silence in an effort to prevent his claims from derailing his candidacy for office. the White House in 2016.\n\nThe jury must decide not only whether Trump caused the payment records to be falsified, but also whether he did it to cover up another crime, an undeclared campaign donation in this case. Both of these findings would make the alleged violations misdemeanors under New York State law.\n\nIn an interview with Al Jazeera at the start of the trial, Gregory Germain, a law professor at Syracuse University in upstate New York, summarized the two essential elements of the indictment: where is the fraud and where is the fraud? [secondary] crime?\n\nAfter each side presents their closing arguments, the judge in the case, Juan Merchan, will give the jury lengthy instructions on how to interpret the law and evidence during their deliberations. This could happen as early as Wednesday.\n\nHow do the jury deliberations take place?\n\nThe deliberations will take place in secret in a room reserved specifically for jurors and according to a deliberately opaque process.\n\nDuring their deliberations, jurors will have access to all of the evidence and can ask questions of the judge, who will speak with prosecutors and defense attorneys before deciding how to respond.\n\nThere is no time limit for deliberating. Jurors must weigh 34 counts of falsifying business records, which could take some time and a verdict may not be returned by the end of the week.\n\nTo reach a verdict of guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it. If the jury is unable to reach a unanimous verdict, it will be deadlocked and Merchan would declare a mistrial.\n\nOnce jurors inform the court that they have reached a verdict, Merchan will call the parties into the courtroom to hear it read by the jury foreman. Merchan has yet to confirm the verdict and make a final judgment. Either party can ask him to overrule the jury.\n\nWhat happens if Trump is found guilty?\n\nIf Trump is found guilty, it will likely be several weeks or months before he is sentenced.\n\nAs a first-time offender of a nonviolent crime, the ex-president and presumptive Republican Party nominee for the 2024 presidential election would likely be released on bail in the meantime.\n\nThe maximum penalty for Trump's crime of falsifying business records is up to four years in prison. But even if jail time is a possibility, experts say a fine, probation or community service are all much more likely options.\n\nWill a conviction affect Trump's electoral chances?\n\nThis remains unclear.\n\nAn ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted in early May found that an overwhelming 80 percent of Trump supporters said they would support the former president in November, even if he were convicted of a crime.\n\nBut 16 percent said they would reconsider their support if he were found guilty, while 4 percent said they would withdraw it, the poll found.\n\nAnother poll, released last week by Quinnipiac University, showed that 6 percent of Trump voters said they would be less likely to vote for Trump if he were convicted, 24 percent said that they would be more likely to vote for him and 68 percent said they would. does not influence their choice.\n\nAlthough the percentage of voters saying they would abandon Trump if he were convicted is small, it could still prove important in a neck-and-neck fight between Trump and Biden.\n\nWill a conviction bring down Trump? The vast majority of his supporters believe that it would not be serious. But in an extremely close race, that 6 percent could tip the scales, said Tim Malloy, a polling analyst at Quinnipiac University.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes

Judge Juan Merchan will then instruct jurors on the law before they start deliberations to deliver their historic verdict.\n\nThe presumptive Republican presidential nominee has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. The case revolves around a $130,000 payment made by Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen to porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election to prevent her from speaking about a sexual tryst she says she had with Trump a decade earlier.\n\nProsecutors say her silence was bought in order to protect Trump's 2016 campaign, and that Trump's reimbursements to Cohen were falsely recorded as legal fees in order to hide the true purpose of the transactions.\n\nThey will remind jurors of the testimony and evidence presented at trial supporting their claims. That includes the testimony of tabloid publisher David Pecker, who spoke about his role in a so-called \"catch and kill\" scheme to bury negative stories about Trump ahead of the election. Trump's onetime campaign spokesperson Hope Hicks also told jurors about the release of the Access Hollywood tape -- in which Trump could be heard bragging about groping women -- and the way his campaign reacted to the crisis.\n\nDaniels herself gave occasionally graphic testimony about her purported one-night stand with Trump in a Lake Tahoe hotel in 2006 (Trump denies ever having sex with Daniels). And the jury also heard crucial testimony from Cohen, the prosecution's star witness, who alleged that Trump approved the reimbursement plan at the heart of the charges.\n\nTrump's defense attorneys, meanwhile, denied that Trump had done anything unlawful and cast Cohen as a proven liar who is now seeking revenge against his former boss. During cross-examination, Cohen admitted to stealing $30,000 from the Trump Organization and said he'd made millions from podcasts and books in which he criticized the former president.\n\nTrump himself did not testify in his own defense despite his expressed intention to do so.\n\nAfter the closing arguments have been delivered, Judge Merchan will then instruct jurors on the law relevant to the case.

Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial.\n\n- Other cases -\n\nAside from Daniels, the key prosecution witness was Michael Cohen, Trump's former \"fixer\" turned bitter foe who arranged the $130,000 hush money payment.\n\nWalking jurors through the reasoning behind the payments, Cohen said they were made \"to ensure that the story would not come out, would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States.\"\n\nTrump's defense team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.\n\nThe defense called only two witnesses of their own before resting.\n\nCalling the case politicized, a coterie of leading Republicans have stood in the wings behind him as he gives remarks to reporters\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.\n\nNone of those trials are expected to take place before the November election.", "source":

After more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys will aim to create doubts about the strength of evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and who served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\nAfter the closing arguments are given, the judge will instruct the jury, likely Wednesday, on the law governing the case and the factors it can take into account during deliberations. The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments Tuesday.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they won't be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence -- and there were many. Judge Juan M. Merchan, for instance, fined Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases Trump is confronting as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.", "source": {"uri": "apnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AP NEWS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

For Dailymail.Com\n\nWill a former president be convicted by a jury of his 'peers' for the first time in history?\n\nIt's only a matter of days until a verdict is reached in Donald Trump's historic criminal hush money trial.\n\nClosing arguments will kick off Tuesday morning as the case comes to a close nearly six grueling weeks later.\n\nProsecutors have a high bar to reach in order to convince the 12-person New York jury that Trump conspired to help his 2016 election campaign by paying pornstar Stormy Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet about their alleged sexual encounters.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's team will wrap up all the evidence and witness testimony they claim is sufficient enough to nail Trump on 34 felony counts of 'falsifying business records.'\n\nIt's only a matter of days until a verdict is reached in in Donald Trump 's historic criminal hush money trial\n\nThe jury has heard bombshell testimony from Trump's former 'fixer' turned foe Michael Cohen, National Enquirer publisher David Pecker and pornstar Stormy Daniels herself who graphically detailed her sexual experiences with the ex-president.\n\nAfter testimony by 22 witnesses, some salacious and some dull, and pages of documents and evidence - it all comes down to whether the prosecution or defense has better laid out their case.\n\nDailyMail.com breaks down what to expect this week as the case comes to a close:\n\nTrump's defense will make its case first\n\nThe defense will deliver its closing arguments first on Tuesday - in the opposite order from the trial.\n\nRead More Why Trump decided not to take the stand\n\nTrump's attorney team is expected to lay out a strong defense of the former president, distancing him from Cohen's payments to Stormy Daniels.\n\nThey will also reiterate several of their strongest points, that hush money payments are not illegal and Trump solely wanted to spare his family humiliation from Stormy's alleged affair claims.\n\nPerhaps the strongest strategy that will be employed by Trump's team is attacking the credibility of the prosecution's 'star witness' Michael Cohen.\n\nThe defense only needs to convince one juror out of the 12 total that there isn't sufficient evidence 'beyond a reasonable doubt' to prove Trump is guilty to hand the ex-president a victory in the case.\n\nAfter over five weeks of jury selection, testimony by 22 witnesses and pages of documents and evidence, it all comes down to who has better laid out their case\n\nIf there is at least one holdout on convicting Trump, a 'hung jury' would be declared by the judge sparking a mistrial.\n\n'He's cloaked in innocence,' Trump attorney Todd Blanche previously insisted about the ex-president during opening statements.\n\n'And that cloak of innocence does not leave President Trump today. It doesn't leave him at any day during this trial. And it won't leave him when you all deliberate. You will find that he is not guilty.'\n\nThe prosecution will run through evidence and testimony again\n\nThe prosecution will follow the defense during arguments, which are expected to go on for several hours.\n\nBragg's team is expected to run through all the evidence they presented during the 19 days they made their case.\n\nThat includes 11 checks, 11 invoices and 12 vouches that prosecutors say are proof of how Trump 'falsified' records to reimburse Cohen for the Stormy Daniels payments.\n\nThey will also have to push back on the defense's argument that Cohen is a 'liar' who cannot be trusted.\n\nLast week, Judge Juan Merchan warned that closing arguments could bleed into a second day.\n\nTrump's team will attack the credibility of the prosecution's 'star witness' Michael Cohen\n\n'In a case like this, which is a rather long case, summations will not be quick,' he stated.\n\nThe court is usually off on Wednesdays, but the judge has indicated that proceedings will continue then so as not to further drag out deliberations.\n\nJury will be instructed by the judge on how to deliberate\n\nOnce the closing arguments are complete, the jury will be instructed by Merchan for about an hour on how to deliberate behind closed doors.\n\nLast week, Merchan considered the instructions that will be read to the 12 jury members who will decide Trump's fate during a 'charging conference.'\n\nIn a win for Trump, the judge said that he would tell the panel to treat Trump fairly during their deliberations.\n\nDonald Trump shook his head in disapproval as the hush money trial judge ripped his lawyer for being 'disingenuous' during a crucial session on instructions that will be given to the jury\n\nThe instruction was outside of the normal language used to charge the jury in a concession to the defense.\n\nThe wording plays a key part in how the jury deliberate and experts believe it can win or lose a case.\n\nOver more than an hour, Trump's lawyers and attorneys from the Manhattan District Attorney's office sparred over the minutiae of the text, in some cases down to single words.\n\nJury deliberations kick off and a verdict will be reached\n\nOnce jurors are dismissed by the judge to work on coming to an agreement in the case, which is expected Wednesday, they could be huddled for days.\n\nIf they have questions, they could come back and ask the judge for an explanation or to read back certain points of the testimony.\n\nTrump ripped into the trial and the judge on Tuesday as the jury was sent home for a week\n\nJudicial experts say that the longer the jury deliberates, the better it is for Trump.\n\nThe outcome of the case could be resolved in one of three manners: an acquittal, a conviction or a mistrial.\n\nIf Trump is convicted, his team will likely start the appeals process, which could take years.\n\nIt is unlikely that Trump, if found guilty, would be sentenced before the 2024 election in November.", "source": {"uri":

After more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys will aim to create doubts about the strength of evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and who served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\nAfter the closing arguments are given, the judge will instruct the jury, likely Wednesday, on the law governing the case and the factors it can take into account during deliberations. The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments Tuesday.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they won't be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence -- and there were many. Judge Juan M. Merchan, for instance, fined Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases Trump is confronting as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Judge Juan Merchan will then instruct jurors on the law before they start deliberations to deliver their historic verdict.\n\nTrump Freaks Out at New York Trial Judge as Jury Deliberation Nears\n\nThe presumptive Republican presidential nominee has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. The case revolves around a $130,000 payment made by Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen to porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election to prevent her from speaking about a sexual tryst she says she had with Trump a decade earlier.\n\nProsecutors say her silence was bought in order to protect Trump's 2016 campaign, and that Trump's reimbursements to Cohen were falsely recorded as legal fees in order to hide the true purpose of the transactions.\n\nThey will remind jurors of the testimony and evidence presented at trial supporting their claims. That includes the testimony of tabloid publisher David Pecker, who spoke about his role in a so-called \"catch and kill\" scheme to bury negative stories about Trump ahead of the election. Trump's onetime campaign spokesperson Hope Hicks also told jurors about the release of the Access Hollywood tape -- in which Trump could be heard bragging about groping women -- and the way his campaign reacted to the crisis.\n\nDaniels herself gave occasionally graphic testimony about her purported one-night stand with Trump in a Lake Tahoe hotel in 2006 (Trump denies ever having sex with Daniels). And the jury also heard crucial testimony from Cohen, the prosecution's star witness, who alleged that Trump approved the reimbursement plan at the heart of the charges.\n\nTrump's defense attorneys, meanwhile, denied that Trump had done anything unlawful and cast Cohen as a proven liar who is now seeking revenge against his former boss. During cross-examination, Cohen admitted to stealing $30,000 from the Trump Organization and said he'd made millions from podcasts and books in which he criticized the former president.\n\nTrump himself did not testify in his own defense despite his expressed intention to do so.\n\nAfter the closing arguments have been delivered, Judge Merchan will then instruct jurors on the law relevant to the case. His instructions are extremely important because they will provide the jury members with guidance on what factors to consider when deciding whether Trump is guilty or not guilty.\n\nThe deliberations will then take place in secret. A verdict could be reached in a matter of hours or take several weeks. If the jury finds Trump guilty, each count carries a potential maximum prison sentence of four years -- though Merchan would not be legally compelled to imprison Trump and the former president would likely appeal any conviction.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

Twelve Manhattan residents will then be tasked with rendering the first criminal verdict on the conduct of a former president in United States history.\n\nThe arguments - also referred to as \"summations\" - allow the two sides to bring together the vast amount of testimony and evidence jurors have taken in over five weeks. Prosecutors will argue that the evidence establishes beyond any reasonable doubt that Trump falsified business records in order to conceal or commit another crime, while the defense team will say it comes up short.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's live updates from inside and outside the Manhattan courtroom:\n\nTrump arrives in courtroom\n\nFormer President Donald Trump arrived in the courtroom at 9:25 a.m. EDT. We are still waiting for the judge and jury.\n\n- Aysha Bagchi\n\nAlvin Bragg in attendance for closing arguments\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg entered the courtroom at 9:24 a.m. EDT. Bragg has attended some previous days of trial. He is seated in the second row of benches behind the prosecution team.\n\nThe prosecution team entered the courtroom at about 9:14 a.m. EDT. We are still waiting on Trump's trial team as well as the judge and the jury.\n\nClosing arguments offer each side a chance to go over evidence from the trial and make arguments about the inferences and conclusions that may fairly be drawn from that evidence.\n\nProsecutors may point to checks with Trump's signatures, excerpts from Trump's books, and recordings introduced at trial in order to bolster the testimony of star witness Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump authorized him to pay Stormy Daniels hush money in 2016 and approved a plan to cover it up in 2017.\n\nThe defense is likely to attack the credibility of Cohen, including by highlighting that he previously pleaded guilty to lying to Congress. Trump's team may also point to the high burden of proof prosecutors face: prosecutors must prove each element of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nUnder New York law, the defense team gives its closing argument first, followed by the prosecution. After both sides have spoken to the jurors, Judge Juan Merchan will instruct them on the law to apply in the case.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump posted a series of messages Monday, on the eve of closing arguments in his New York hush money trial, railing against the case as election interference and quoting scripture.\n\nBesides criticizing Judge Juan Merchan and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Trump questioned why the prosecution gets the final word before jury deliberations. Typically in summing up the evidence in a case, prosecutors make their statements, defense lawyers speak and prosecutors get a final rebuttal because they have the burden of proving their case.\n\n\"Big advantage, very unfair,\" Trump said in an all-caps post on Truth Social.\n\nTrump also quoted a passage from the book of John in the Bible about personal sacrifice. Trump and his supporters have described his four criminal cases as political persecution.\n\n\"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,\" the post said.\n\nEach count against Trump carries a maximum penalty of four years in prison and no minimum amount of jail or prison time. If Trump is convicted on all counts, Merchan will be tasked with deciding on a sentence for each count, and also deciding whether the sentences will coincide with each other or be run one after the other. However, New York law caps sentences for Class E felonies such as those Trump is charged with at 20 years.\n\nLegal experts told USA TODAY it's possible Trump could get just probation, even if he were convicted on every count. Most predicted any incarceration sentence on each count would run simultaneously with the others, so Trump wouldn't be ordered to serve more than four years behind bars. Experts also said Trump would likely be free while his expected appeal ran its course.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in order to conceal or commit another crime. The records - including checks, vouchers, and invoices - all relate to payments to former Trump lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen in 2017. Prosecutors say the payments were reimbursing Cohen for $130,000 in hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016, but the records were falsified to make the payments look like 2017 legal expenses.\n\nProsecutors say Trump was covering up the violation of federal campaign finance laws through the hush money, which was handed over less than two weeks before the 2016 presidential election. They also say Trump was trying to hide a plan to violate New York tax and election laws.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty, and Trump defense lawyer Todd Blanche has denied the payments were reimbursing the hush money.\n\n- Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhy does Trump's team say the case should be dismissed?\n\nJudge Juan Merchan may issue a ruling today on Trump's request to toss out the entire case ahead of jury deliberations.\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche told Merchan that prosecutors haven't put on enough evidence for the case to go to the jury because the business records at issue weren't false. He said documents show Trump was paying Michael Cohen for ongoing legal services in 2017. Blanche also said the prosecution's case shouldn't be able to stand given Cohen's history of lying, including - according to the Trump defense lawyer - during this trial.", "source": {"uri": "eu.clarionledger.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Clarion-Ledger"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Burden of proof (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deliberation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/22/USAT/73801371007-20240521-t-192056-z-448540349-rc-25-v-7-advkjx-rtrmadp-3-usatrumpnewyork.JPG?auto=webp&crop=5999,3376,x0,y311&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial.\n\nAside from Daniels, the key prosecution witness was Michael Cohen, Trump's former \"fixer\" turned bitter foe who said he arranged the $130,000 hush money payment so her story \"would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States.\"\n\nTrump's defense team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.\n\nNone of those trials are expected to

If they cannot agree, which would result in a hung jury, prosecutors would then decide to retry the case.\n\nFor Trump, the outcome has serious consequences, not only for his personal freedom but also for his political destiny. He is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in 2024, and is expected to run again in the November election against President Joe Biden, the Democrat who defeated him in 2020.\n\nNational polls show Biden and Trump facing off in a close contest, but some opinion polls indicate Trump supporters could vote for Biden or not vote at all if the former president is convicted.\n\nIn the criminal case, Trump is accused of approving a scheme in which his political intermediary, Michael Cohen, paid $130,000 in hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 election for prevent him from speaking publicly about his allegations of accusation. one-night date with Trump at a celebrity golf tournament a decade earlier.\n\nTrump has denied the affair with Daniels and the 34-count indictment he faces for falsifying business records of his real estate conglomerate Trump Organization to hide the 2017 reimbursement to Cohen, calling it a payment for the legal work he had done for Trump.\n\nIf convicted, Trump could face probation or be sentenced to up to four years in prison, although he will certainly appeal and could continue to run for president.\n\nTrump faces three other indictments, two of which accuse him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat. But all three cases are linked to legal wrangling between his lawyers and prosecutors. As a result, the New York case, which is nearing completion, could be the only one to be decided before the November elections.\n\nTrump had often said he wanted to testify in his own defense at trial, but ultimately did not do so, which was his right.\n\nTrump's team only called two witnesses to the stand. One of them, New York lawyer Robert Costello, said that in 2018 Cohen assured him that he had nothing on Trump and that it was he, not Trump, who concocted the secret payment agreement with Daniels.\n\nEarly in the case, Trump often attacked Cohen and other witnesses, despite Merchan's gag order prohibiting Trump from attacking them and jurors. Mercan excluded himself and prosecutor Alvin Bragg from the decree.\n\nMerchan held Trump in contempt of court 10 times and fined him $10,000, after which Trump appeared to target only the judge and prosecutor.\n\nTrump urged several Republican lawmakers to appear in the courtroom behind the defense table in a show of support. Lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, often stayed an hour or two to testify and then, because they were not subject to the gag order, walked out of the courthouse and held conferences press to criticize witnesses against Trump, particularly Cohen and Daniels.\n\nCohen testified that he did little legal work for Trump in 2017 and that the country's 45th president twice authorized the repayment plan and the claim that it was legal work, once in his Trump Tower in New York before his ascension to the presidency and again in 2017. the Oval Office of the White House less than three weeks after his inauguration.\n\nBut the question before the jurors is that of Cohen's credibility.\n\nHe admitted during hours of testimony that he had been a serial liar over the years on behalf of Trump and to protect his own wife from accusations of tax evasion. He said that as part of the hush money payback scheme, he stole $60,000 from Trump's company because he felt Trump sold him short on his 2016 year-end bonus.\n\nCohen testified that with Trump's consent, Allen Weisselberg, then the Trump Organization's chief financial officer, increased the overall reimbursement to $420,000, in part to cover Cohen's tax obligation, and that the reimbursement was paid by monthly installments of $35,000 in 2017, with Trump signing nine of the 11 checks to Cohen.\n\nDespite his central role in the reimbursement, Weisselberg, who is currently serving a five-month prison sentence for lying under oath in a previous Trump-related civil business fraud case, was not called as a witness by either side.\n\nEarly trial witnesses described Cohen as brash, profane and volatile. However, on the witness stand, the 57-year-old disbarred attorney appeared reserved and did not erupt during hours of fierce cross-examination by Trump lawyer Todd Blanche.\n\nFor years, Cohen was a Trump loyalist, his lawyer and political fixer who catered to his every whim during his years as a New York real estate mogul and during his campaign for office. presidency in 2016. As news of Daniels' claim of an affair with Trump and discreetly repaying the money to Cohen became public in 2018, the relationship between the then-president and Cohen broke down after federal agents searched his then-New York home, a hotel room.\n\nUltimately, Cohen pleaded guilty to perjury for lying to a congressional panel about a plan to build Trump Tower in Moscow that never came to fruition, tax fraud, and a violation of campaign finance law linked to secret payment of money to Daniels. He served 13 months in federal prison and another year and a half on home detention.\n\nSince then, he has become a persistent critic of Trump. He clearly stated that he hoped Trump would be found guilty.\n\nDavid Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid newspaper, testified how he agreed, during a meeting at Trump Tower in 2015 with Trump and Cohen, to publish positive articles about Trump as he sought the 2016 Republican presidential inauguration, as well as negative and embarrassing articles about his political opponents, and to prevent the publication of other inflammatory stories about Trump.\n\nIt was called \"catch and kill\" in the vernacular of the tabloid world. In one case, Pecker said he paid $150,000 to Karen McDougal, Playboy magazine's 1998 Playmate of the Year, to buy the rights to her claim of a 10-month affair with Trump in 2006 and 2007, without having the I intend to post anything about this. Trump also denied her allegations, but prosecutors did not call her as a witness.\n\nA month before the November 2016 election, the Washington Post discovered a clip from the 2005 Access Hollywood show, in which Trump bragged about being able to grope women at will because he was a star.\n\nThe emergence of the gang led directly to the secret payment of the money to Daniels. The Trump campaign feared that the Access Hollywood images might offend female voters and that another sex-related Trump story would be worse. Daniels, at the same time, was peddling his story about Trump or wanting the money to stay quiet.\n\nCohen said he created a shell company, transferred money from his home equity line of credit into it, and wired Daniels' lawyer the $130,000 in hush money just days before the election . Cohen said Trump told him to do so, and Cohen said he would not have made the payment himself without Trump's agreement.\n\nIn one week, Trump narrowly defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton, the former US first lady and secretary of state, to win a four-year term in the White House.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType":

After more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys will aim to create doubts about the strength of evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and who served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\nAfter the closing arguments are given, the judge will instruct the jury, likely Wednesday, on the law governing the case and the factors it can take into account during deliberations. The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments Tuesday.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they won't be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence -- and there were many. Judge Juan M. Merchan, for instance, fined Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases Trump is confronting as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election.

Trump arrived Monday in New York where he will surrender to unprecedented criminal charges, taking America into uncharted and potentially volatile territory as he seeks to regain the presidency. The 76-year-old Republican, the first US president ever to be criminally indicted, will be formally charged Tuesday over hush money paid to a porn star during the 2016 election campaign.\n\nAFP / Andrew Caballero-Reynolds\n\nNEW YORK, United States -- The historic trial of Donald Trump enters its final act Tuesday, with closing arguments to the jury who must then decide whether to hand down the first ever criminal conviction of a former US president.\n\nLess than six months before American voters choose whether to return Trump to the White House, the stakes riding on the verdict are hard to overstate -- for the 77-year-old personally, but also for the country as a whole.\n\nTrump is accused of falsifying business records to buy the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels about a 2006 sexual encounter between them that could have damaged his 2016 presidential bid.\n\nIf convicted, he faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.\n\nCrucially, a conviction would not bar Trump from appearing on the ballot in November as the Republican presidential challenger to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nIt has taken nearly five weeks, the testimony of more than 20 witnesses and a few courtroom fireworks to reach closing arguments -- the last chance for the prosecution and defense to impress their case on the anonymous, 12-member jury.\n\nAs expected, Trump chose not to testify in his defense -- a move that would have exposed him to unnecessary legal jeopardy and forensic cross-examination.\n\nFor a man who has always prided himself on being in charge and in control, the role of silent, passive defendant did not come easily.\n\nAt times it has been downright excruciating, especially when Trump was forced to sit and listen while Daniels recounted their alleged encounter in sometimes graphic detail.\n\nSpeaking to reporters before and after each day in court, Trump launched regular tirades against Judge Juan Merchan -- calling him \"corrupt\" and a \"tyrant\" -- and condemned the whole trial as \"election interference\" by Democrats intent on keeping him off the campaign trail.\n\nThe politics of the case were in full view in the final days when a coterie of leading Republicans -- including several vice-presidential hopefuls -- came to the court and stood behind Trump in a gesture of support as he spoke to the press.\n\nIn all, he was cited 10 times for contempt of court and fined $10,000 by Merchan for failing to heed a gag order prohibiting him from publicly attacking witnesses, the jury, court staff or their relatives.\n\nThe judge has said he expects closing arguments to take up all of Tuesday.\n\nHe will then give his final instructions to the jury, who will likely begin their deliberations on Wednesday.\n\nTo return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires unanimity. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial.\n\nOther cases\n\nAside from Daniels, the key prosecution witness was Michael Cohen, Trump's former \"fixer\" turned bitter foe who arranged the $130,000 hush money payment.\n\nWalking jurors through the reasoning behind the payments, Cohen said they were made \"to ensure that the story would not come out, would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States.\"\n\nTrump's defense team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.\n\nThe defense called only two witnesses of their own before resting.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.\n\nNone of those trials are expected to take place before the November election.", "source": {"uri": "philstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Philstar.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_lefkow@philstar.com", "name": "Chris

The testimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. (Curtis Means/DailyMail.com via AP, Pool, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The testimony in Donald Trump's New York hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict.\n\nIt's impossible to say how long all of that will take, but in a landmark trial that's already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could easily be the most important.\n\nStarting Tuesday morning, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments expected to last for much of the day, if not all of it.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election to a porn star who alleged she had a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nSEE ALSO: Prosecutors want to bar Trump from statements endangering agents in classified docs case\n\nLook for prosecutors to remind jurors that they can trust the financial paperwork they've seen and the witnesses they've heard from. That includes porn actor Stormy Daniels, whose account of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump is at the heart of the case, and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme and authorized payments.\n\nIt's worth remembering that the defense, which called only two witnesses but not Trump, doesn't have to prove anything or convince jurors of Trump's innocence.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nExpect the defense to try to poke holes in the government's case by disputing Daniels' testimony about her hotel suite encounter with Trump and by distancing Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements to Cohen, who was responsible for the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels.\n\nThe defense may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid.\n\nAnd it'll certainly attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand. How much of his testimony the jury believes will go a long way in determining the outcome of the case.\n\nSince the prosecution has the burden of proof, it will deliver its summation last -- the reverse order from opening statements, in which the prosecution went first.\n\nONE LAST THING BEFORE THE JURY DELIBERATES\n\nA critical moment will take place, perhaps Wednesday morning, before the jury begins its deliberations.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nIn an indication of just how important those instructions are, prosecutors and defense lawyers had a spirited debate last week outside the jury's presence as they sought to persuade Merchan about the instructions he should give.\n\nThe Trump team, for instance, sought an instruction informing jurors that the types of hush money payments at issue in Trump's case are not inherently illegal, a request a prosecutor called \"totally inappropriate.\" Merchan said such an instruction would go too far and is unnecessary.\n\nTrump's team also asked Merchan to consider the \"extraordinarily important\" nature of the case when issuing his instructions and to urge jurors to reach \"very specific findings.\" Prosecutors objected to that as well, and Merchan agreed that it would be wrong to deviate from the standard instructions.\n\n\"When you say it's a very important case, you're asking me to change the law, and I'm not going to do that,\" Merchan said.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, requested an instruction that someone's status as a candidate doesn't need to be the sole motivation for making a payment that benefits the campaign. Defense lawyers asked for jurors to be told that if a payment would have been made even if the person wasn't running, it shouldn't be treated as a campaign contribution.\n\nONCE THE JURY GETS THE CASE\n\nThe deliberations will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that's intentionally opaque.\n\nJurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it's hard to read too much into the meaning of any note.\n\nIt's anyone's guess how long the jury will deliberate for and there's no time limit either. The jury must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records, so that could take some time, and a verdict might not come by the end of the week.\n\nTo reach a verdict, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it.\n\nThings will get trickier if the jury can't reach a consensus after several days of deliberations. Though defense lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial, Merchan is likely to call the jurors in and instruct them to keep trying for a verdict and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others.\n\nIf, after that instruction, the jury still can't reach a verdict, the judge would have the option to deem the panel hopelessly deadlocked and declare a mistrial.\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "ktul.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTUL"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@ktul.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "eric_tucker@ktul.com", "name": "Eric Tucker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deliberation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_instructions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury instructions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burden of proof (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opening statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Supplies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Tri-Ominos", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Tri-Ominos", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://ktul.com/resources/media/38f5ed68-87dd-4b71-84c2-83351b64a849-large16x9_AP24146732656102.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-04-", "textStart": 74, "textEnd": 82}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Jurors followed testimony that unfolded for several days in each of the last six weeks.\n\nNew York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan is then expected to instruct the jury Wednesday morning about the legal issues linked to the case before it begins deliberating.\n\nUnder the U.S. legal system, the jurors will have to unanimously decide whether to acquit the 77-year-old Trump or find him guilty. If they cannot agree, resulting in a hung jury, prosecutors then would decide whether to retry the case.\n\nFor Trump, the outcome is consequential, not only for his personal freedom but his political fate. He is the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential candidate, set to run again in the November election against President Joe Biden, the Democrat who defeated him in 2020.\n\nNational polls show Biden and Trump locked in a tight contest, but some opinion polls indicate Trump supporters could switch their vote to Biden or not vote at all if the former president is convicted.\n\nIn the criminal case, Trump is accused of sanctioning a scheme in which his political fixer, Michael Cohen, made a $130,000 hush money payment to porn film star Stormy Daniels just ahead of the 2016 election to keep her from talking publicly about her claim of a one-night tryst with Trump at a celebrity golf tourney a decade earlier.\n\nIn this courtroom sketch, Michael Cohen, right, testifies on the witness stand with Judge Juan Merchan presiding in Manhattan criminal court, May 20, 2024, in New York.\n\nThrough his lawyer at the trial, Trump denied the liaison with Daniels and the 34-count indictment he is facing - falsifying business records at his Trump Organization real estate conglomerate to hide the 2017 reimbursement to Cohen, labeling it as payments for legal work he had done for Trump.\n\nIf convicted, Trump could be placed on probation or sentenced to up to four years in prison, although he is certain to appeal and could continue to run for the presidency.\n\nTrump is facing three other indictments, including two accusing him of illegally trying to upend his 2020 election loss. But all three cases are tied up in legal wrangling between his lawyers and prosecutors. As a result, the New York case nearing completion may be the only one decided before the November election.\n\nTrump had often said he wanted to testify in his own defense at the trial, but in the end, did not, which was his right.\n\nTrump's team put only two witnesses on the stand. One of them, New York lawyer Robert Costello, who was looking to be hired by Cohen but never was, said that in 2018, Cohen assured him he had \"nothing on Trump\" and that he, not Trump, concocted the hush money payment deal with Daniels.\n\nEach day in the entryway to the courtroom, Trump assailed Merchan for his oversight of the case, calling him corrupt, and New York prosecutor Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, for bringing the charges. Early in the case, Trump often assailed Cohen and other witnesses, despite Merchan's gag order prohibiting Trump from attacking them and jurors. Merchan excluded himself and Bragg from the edict.\n\nMerchan found Trump in contempt of court 10 times and fined him $10,000, after which Trump seemed to aim his broadsides solely at the judge and prosecutor.\n\nInstead, Trump urged several Republican lawmakers to show up in the courtroom in the seats behind the defense table as a show of support. The legislators, including House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, often stayed for an hour or two of testimony and then, because they were not subject to the gag order, walked outside the courthouse and held news conferences to criticize the case and the witnesses against Trump, especially Cohen and Daniels.\n\nTrump's second son, Eric Trump, was a frequent visitor at the trial, and to a lesser degree, his older brother, Donald Trump Jr. No other Trump relatives, including former first lady Melania Trump, showed up.\n\nCohen testified that he did next to no legal work for Trump in 2017, and that the country's 45th president twice authorized the reimbursement plan and the claim that it was for legal work, once at his Trump Tower in New York before he assumed the presidency and again in the White House Oval Office less than three weeks after he was inaugurated.\n\nBut the question for the jurors is Cohen's credibility.\n\nHe acknowledged during hours of testimony that he has over the years been a serial liar on Trump's behalf and to protect his own wife from tax evasion charges. He said that as part of the hush money reimbursement plan, he stole $60,000 from the Trump company because he felt Trump had shorted him on his year-end 2016 bonus.\n\nCohen testified that with Trump's consent, Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization's then-chief financial officer, \"grossed up\" the overall reimbursement to $420,000, in part to cover Cohen's tax liability, and that the reimbursement was paid out in $35,000 monthly increments in 2017, with Trump signing nine of the 11 checks to Cohen.\n\nDespite his pivotal role in the reimbursement, Weisselberg, now serving a five-month prison sentence for lying under oath in a previous Trump-related business fraud civil case, was not called as a witness by either side.\n\nEarly witnesses in the trial portrayed Cohen as brash, profane and volatile. However, on the witness stand, the 57-year-old disbarred lawyer was reserved and did not erupt under hours of a withering cross-examination by Trump lawyer Todd Blanche.\n\nFor years, Cohen was a Trump loyalist, his lawyer and political fixer who tended to Trump's every whim during his years as a New York real estate magnate and during his 2016 run for the presidency. As news of Daniels' claim of a liaison with Trump and the hush money reimbursement to Cohen became public in 2018, the relationship between the then-president and Cohen ruptured after federal agents raided his then-New York home, a hotel room.\n\nIn the end, Cohen pleaded guilty to perjury in connection with his lying to a congressional panel about a Trump Tower construction project in Moscow that never materialized, tax fraud and a campaign finance law violation linked to the hush money payment to Daniels. He served 13\u00bd months in a federal prison and another year and a half in home confinement.\n\nSince then, he has turned into a persistent Trump critic. He testified pointedly that he hopes Trump is convicted.\n\nDavid Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid newspaper, testified how he agreed in a 2015 Trump Tower meeting with Trump and Cohen to publish positive stories about Trump as he sought the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, along with negative and embarrassing stories about his political opponents, and to keep other inflammatory stories about Trump from being published.\n\nIt was called \"catch and kill\" in the vernacular of the world of tabloid news. In one instance, Pecker said he paid $150,000 to Karen McDougal, Playboy magazine's 1998 Playmate of the Year, to buy the rights to her claim of a 10-month affair with Trump in 2006 and 2007, with no intention of publishing anything about it. Trump denied her claim as well, but prosecutors did not call her as a witness.\n\nA month before the 2016 November election, The Washington Post unearthed a 2005 outtake from the celebrity-driven \"Access Hollywood\" show in which Trump boasted that he could grope women at will because he was a star.\n\nThe emergence of the tape led directly to the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, who was hawking the story of her alleged encounter with Trump or wanted money to stay quiet about it. Cohen said he created a shell company, transferred money into it from his home equity line of credit and wired Daniels' lawyer the $130,000 just days before the election.\n\nWithin a week, Trump narrowly defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton, a former first lady and U.S. secretary of state, to become president.", "source": {"uri": "northernirelandnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Northern

If convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but unlikely to get jail time. The trial's outcome could impact the 2020 election.The historic trial of Donald Trump enters its final act Tuesday, with closing arguments to the jury who must then decide whether to hand down the first ever criminal conviction of a former US president.\n\nLess than six months before American voters choose whether to return Trump to the White House, the stakes riding on the verdict are hard to overstate -- for the 77-year-old personally, but also for the country as a whole.\n\nTrump is accused of falsifying business records to buy the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels about a 2006 sexual encounter between them that could have damaged his 2016 presidential bid.\n\nIf convicted, he faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.\n\nCrucially, a conviction would not bar Trump from appearing on the ballot in November as the Republican presidential challenger to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nIt has taken nearly five weeks, the testimony of more than 20 witnesses and a few courtroom fireworks to reach closing arguments -- the last chance for the prosecution and defense to impress their case on the anonymous, 12-member jury.\n\nAs expected, Trump chose not to testify in his defense -- a move that would have exposed him to unnecessary legal jeopardy and forensic cross-examination.\n\nFor a man who has always prided himself on being in charge and in control, the role of silent, passive defendant did not come easily.\n\nAt times it has been downright excruciating, especially when Trump was forced to sit and listen while Daniels recounted their alleged encounter in sometimes graphic detail.\n\nSpeaking to reporters before and after each day in court, Trump launched regular tirades against Judge Juan Merchan -- calling him \"corrupt\" and a \"tyrant\" -- and condemned the whole trial as \"election interference\" by Democrats intent on keeping him off the campaign trail.\n\nThe politics of the case were in full view in the final days when a coterie of leading Republicans -- including several vice-presidential hopefuls -- came to the court and stood behind Trump in a gesture of support as he spoke to the press.\n\nIn all, he was cited 10 times for contempt of court and fined $10,000 by Merchan for failing to heed a gag order prohibiting him from publicly attacking witnesses, the jury, court staff or their relatives.\n\nThe judge has said he expects closing arguments to take up all of Tuesday.\n\nHe will then give his final instructions to the jury, who will likely begin their deliberations on Wednesday.\n\nTo return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires unanimity. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial.\n\n- Other cases -\n\nAside from Daniels, the key prosecution witness was Michael Cohen, Trump's former \"fixer\" turned bitter foe who arranged the $130,000 hush money payment.\n\nWalking jurors through the reasoning behind the payments, Cohen said they were made \"to ensure that the story would not come out, would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States.\"\n\nTrump's defense team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.\n\nThe defense called only two witnesses of their own before resting.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.\n\nNone of those trials are expected to take place before the November election.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict?", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- The testimony in Donald Trump's New York hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict.\n\nIt's impossible to say how long all of that will take, but in a landmark trial that's already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could easily be the most important.\n\nHere's what to expect in the days ahead:\n\nWhat happens during closing arguments?\n\nStarting Tuesday morning, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments expected to last for much of the day, if not all of it.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election to a porn star who alleged she had a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nLook for prosecutors to remind jurors that they can trust the financial paperwork they've seen and the witnesses they've heard from. That includes porn actor Stormy Daniels, whose account of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump is at the heart of the case, and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme and authorized payments.\n\nIt's worth remembering that the defense, which called only two witnesses but not Trump, doesn't have to prove anything or convince jurors of Trump's innocence.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nExpect the defense to try to poke holes in the government's case by disputing Daniels' testimony about her hotel suite encounter with Trump and by distancing Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements to Cohen, who was responsible for the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels.\n\nThe defense may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid.\n\nAnd it'll certainly attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand. How much of his testimony the jury believes will go a long way in determining the outcome of the case.\n\nSince the prosecution has the burden of proof, it will deliver its summation last -- the reverse order from opening statements, in which the prosecution went first.\n\nOne last thing before jury deliberations\n\nA critical moment will take place, perhaps Wednesday morning, before the jury begins its deliberations.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nIn an indication of just how important those instructions are, prosecutors and defense lawyers had a spirited debate last week outside the jury's presence as they sought to persuade Merchan about the instructions he should give.\n\nThe Trump team, for instance, sought an instruction informing jurors that the types of hush money payments at issue in Trump's case are not inherently illegal, a request a prosecutor called \"totally inappropriate.\" Merchan said such an instruction would go too far and is unnecessary.\n\nREAD MORE: Here's what every key witness said at Trump's hush money criminal trial\n\nTrump's team also asked Merchan to consider the \"extraordinarily important\" nature of the case when issuing his instructions and to urge jurors to reach \"very specific findings.\" Prosecutors objected to that as well, and Merchan agreed that it would be wrong to deviate from the standard instructions.\n\n\"When you say it's a very important case, you're asking me to change the law, and I'm not going to do that,\" Merchan said.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, requested an instruction that someone's status as a candidate doesn't need to be the sole motivation for making a payment that benefits the campaign. Defense lawyers asked for jurors to be told that if a payment would have been made even if the person wasn't running, it shouldn't be treated as a campaign contribution.\n\nOnce the jury gets the case\n\nThe deliberations will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that's intentionally opaque.\n\nJurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them.

Jurors followed testimony that unfolded for several days in each of the last six weeks.\n\nNew York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan is then expected to instruct the jury Wednesday morning about the legal issues linked to the case before it begins deliberating.\n\nUnder the U.S. legal system, the jurors will have to unanimously decide whether to acquit the 77-year-old Trump or find him guilty. If they cannot agree, resulting in a hung jury, prosecutors then would decide whether to retry the case.\n\nFor Trump, the outcome is consequential, not only for his personal freedom but his political fate. He is the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential candidate, set to run again in the November election against President Joe Biden, the Democrat who defeated him in 2020.\n\nNational polls show Biden and Trump locked in a tight contest, but some opinion polls indicate Trump supporters could switch their vote to Biden or not vote at all if the former president is convicted.\n\nIn the criminal case, Trump is accused of sanctioning a scheme in which his political fixer, Michael Cohen, made a $130,000 hush money payment to porn film star Stormy Daniels just ahead of the 2016 election to keep her from talking publicly about her claim of a one-night tryst with Trump at a celebrity golf tourney a decade earlier.\n\nThrough his lawyer at the trial, Trump denied the liaison with Daniels and the 34-count indictment he is facing -- falsifying business records at his Trump Organization real estate conglomerate to hide the 2017 reimbursement to Cohen, labeling it as payments for legal work he had done for Trump.\n\nIf convicted, Trump could be placed on probation or sentenced to up to four years in prison, although he is certain to appeal and could continue to run for the presidency.\n\nTrump is facing three other indictments, including two accusing him of illegally trying to upend his 2020 election loss. But all three cases are tied up in legal wrangling between his lawyers and prosecutors. As a result, the New York case nearing completion may be the only one decided before the November election.\n\nTrump had often said he wanted to testify in his own defense at the trial, but in the end, did not, which was his right.\n\nTrump's team put only two witnesses on the stand. One of them, New York lawyer Robert Costello, who was looking to be hired by Cohen but never was, said that in 2018, Cohen assured him he had \"nothing on Trump\" and that he, not Trump, concocted the hush money payment deal with Daniels.\n\nEach day in the entryway to the courtroom, Trump assailed Merchan for his oversight of the case, calling him corrupt, and New York prosecutor Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, for bringing the charges. Early in the case, Trump often assailed Cohen and other witnesses, despite Merchan's gag order prohibiting Trump from attacking them and jurors. Merchan excluded himself and Bragg from the edict.\n\nMerchan found Trump in contempt of court 10 times and fined him $10,000, after which Trump seemed to aim his broadsides solely at the judge and prosecutor.\n\nInstead, Trump urged several Republican lawmakers to show up in the courtroom in the seats behind the defense table as a show of support. The legislators, including House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, often stayed for an hour or two of testimony and then, because they were not subject to the gag order, walked outside the courthouse and held news conferences to criticize the case and the witnesses against Trump, especially Cohen and Daniels.\n\nTrump's second son, Eric Trump, was a frequent visitor at the trial, and to a lesser degree, his older brother, Donald Trump Jr. No other Trump relatives, including former first lady Melania Trump, showed up.\n\nCohen testified that he did next to no legal work for Trump in 2017, and that the country's 45th president twice authorized the reimbursement plan and the claim that it was for legal work, once at his Trump Tower in New York before he assumed the presidency and again in the White House Oval Office less than three weeks after he was inaugurated.\n\nBut the question for the jurors is Cohen's credibility.\n\nHe acknowledged during hours of testimony that he has over the years been a serial liar on Trump's behalf and to protect his own wife from tax evasion charges. He said that as part of the hush money reimbursement plan, he stole $60,000 from the Trump company because he felt Trump had shorted him on his year-end 2016 bonus.\n\nCohen testified that with Trump's consent, Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization's then-chief financial officer, \"grossed up\" the overall reimbursement to $420,000, in part to cover Cohen's tax liability, and that the reimbursement was paid out in $35,000 monthly increments in 2017, with Trump signing nine of the 11 checks to Cohen.\n\nDespite his pivotal role in the reimbursement, Weisselberg, now serving a five-month prison sentence for lying under oath in a previous Trump-related business fraud civil case, was not called as a witness by either side.\n\nEarly witnesses in the trial portrayed Cohen as brash, profane and volatile. However, on the witness stand, the 57-year-old disbarred lawyer was reserved and did not erupt under hours of a withering cross-examination by Trump lawyer Todd Blanche.\n\nFor years, Cohen was a Trump loyalist, his lawyer and political fixer who tended to Trump's every whim during his years as a New York real estate magnate and during his 2016 run for the presidency. As news of Daniels' claim of a liaison with Trump and the hush money reimbursement to Cohen became public in 2018, the relationship between the then-president and Cohen ruptured after federal agents raided his then-New York home, a hotel room.\n\nIn the end, Cohen pleaded guilty to perjury in connection with his lying to a congressional panel about a Trump Tower construction project in Moscow that never materialized, tax fraud and a campaign finance law violation linked to the hush money payment to Daniels. He served 13\u00bd months in a federal prison and another year and a half in home confinement.\n\nSince then, he has turned into a persistent Trump critic. He testified pointedly that he hopes Trump is convicted.\n\nDavid Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid newspaper, testified how he agreed in a 2015 Trump Tower meeting with Trump and Cohen to publish positive stories about Trump as he sought the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, along with negative and embarrassing stories about his political opponents, and to keep other inflammatory stories about Trump from being published.\n\nIt was called \"catch and kill\" in the vernacular of the world of tabloid news. In one instance, Pecker said he paid $150,000 to Karen McDougal, Playboy magazine's 1998 Playmate of the Year, to buy the rights to her claim of a 10-month affair with Trump in 2006 and 2007, with no intention of publishing anything about it. Trump denied her claim as well, but prosecutors did not call her as a witness.\n\nA month before the 2016 November election, The Washington Post unearthed a 2005 outtake from the celebrity-driven \"Access Hollywood\" show in which Trump boasted that he could grope women at will because he was a star.\n\nThe emergence of the tape led directly to the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, who was hawking the story of her alleged encounter with Trump or wanted money to stay quiet about it. Cohen said he created a shell company, transferred money into it from his home equity line of credit and wired Daniels' lawyer the $130,000 just days before the election.\n\nWithin a week, Trump narrowly defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton, a former first lady and U.S. secretary of state, to become president.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of

Major week looms in Trump hush money trial", "body": "FILE - Michael Cohen leaves his apartment building on his way to Manhattan criminal court, May 13, 2024, in New York. The testimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. Expect the defense to attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The testimony in Donald Trump's New York hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict.\n\nIt's impossible to say how long all of that will take, but in a landmark trial that's already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could easily be the most important.\n\nHere's what to expect in the days ahead:\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nStarting Tuesday morning, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments expected to last for much of the day, if not all of it.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election to a porn star who alleged she had a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nLook for prosecutors to remind jurors that they can trust the financial paperwork they've seen and the witnesses they've heard from. That includes porn actor Stormy Daniels, whose account of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump is at the heart of the case, and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme and authorized payments.\n\nIt's worth remembering that the defense, which called only two witnesses but not Trump, doesn't have to prove anything or convince jurors of Trump's innocence.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nExpect the defense to try to poke holes in the government's case by disputing Daniels' testimony about her hotel suite encounter with Trump and by distancing Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements to Cohen, who was responsible for the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels.\n\nThe defense may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid.\n\nAnd it'll certainly attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand. How much of his testimony the jury believes will go a long way in determining the outcome of the case.\n\nSince the prosecution has the burden of proof, it will deliver its summation last -- the reverse order from opening statements, in which the prosecution went first.\n\nONE LAST THING BEFORE THE JURY DELIBERATES\n\nA critical moment will take place, perhaps Wednesday morning, before the jury begins its deliberations.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nIn an indication of just how important those instructions are, prosecutors and defense lawyers had a spirited debate last week outside the jury's presence as they sought to persuade Merchan about the instructions he should give.\n\nThe Trump team, for instance, sought an instruction informing jurors that the types of hush money payments at issue in Trump's case are not inherently illegal, a request a prosecutor called \"totally inappropriate.\" Merchan said such an instruction would go too far and is unnecessary.\n\nTrump's team also asked Merchan to consider the \"extraordinarily important\" nature of the case when issuing his instructions and to urge jurors to reach \"very specific findings.\" Prosecutors objected to that as well, and Merchan agreed that it would be wrong to deviate from the standard instructions.\n\n\"When you say it's a very important case, you're asking me to change the law, and I'm not going to do that,\" Merchan said.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, requested an instruction that someone's status as a candidate doesn't need to be the sole motivation for making a payment that benefits the campaign. Defense lawyers asked for jurors to be told that if a payment would have been made even if the person wasn't running, it shouldn't be treated as a campaign contribution.\n\nONCE THE JURY GETS THE CASE\n\nThe deliberations will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that's intentionally opaque.\n\nJurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it's hard to read too much into the meaning of any note.\n\nIt's anyone's guess how long the jury will deliberate for and there's no time limit either. The jury must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records, so that could take some time, and a verdict might not come by the end of the week.\n\nTo reach a verdict, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it.\n\nThings will get trickier if the jury can't reach a consensus after several days of deliberations. Though defense lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial, Merchan is likely to call the jurors in and instruct them to keep trying for a verdict and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others.\n\nIf, after that instruction, the jury still can't reach a verdict, the judge would have the option to deem the panel hopelessly deadlocked and declare a mistrial.\n\nAssociated Press writers Jennifer Peltz, Michael R.

(Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images)\n\n(NEW YORK) -- Thirty-six days ago, prosecutors with the Manhattan district attorney's office set out to convince a jury of 12 New Yorkers that Donald Trump broke the law by hiding damaging information from voters.\n\nDuring closing arguments Tuesday, they'll attempt to convince that jury to convict the former president on 34 felony counts -- a historic decision in what could be the only one of Trump's criminal cases that reaches a verdict before the 2024 election.\n\nProsecutors built their case across four weeks of testimony, calling 20 witnesses including Stormy Daniels, the adult film actress whose hush money payment sits at the center of the case; Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer who made the payment to Daniels just days ahead of the 2016 election; and multiple Trump Organization employees who helped orchestrate Cohen's alleged reimbursement in 2017.\n\nWith the burden on prosecutors to prove the case, Trump's lawyers put on a brief defense case -- calling just two witnesses -- and sought to discredit key witnesses like Cohen and Daniels.\n\nSome of the key events at the center of the case -- that Daniels was paid $130,000 for her silence and that Cohen was paid $420,000 by Trump in 2017 -- are undisputed by defense lawyers. As a result, the closing arguments are likely to focus on Trump's awareness of Cohen's conduct, and Trump's motivations for allegedly approving the payments.\n\nProsecutors argue that Trump approved Daniels' hush money payment to influence the election, while defense lawyers pin the arrangement on Cohen and say Trump was simply trying to protect his family. Defense lawyers attempted to cast Cohen's alleged reimbursement after the election as legitimate payments processed by accountants at the Trump Organization, but prosecutors say the payments were disguised to hide their true purpose from voters.\n\nThe jury -- comprised of seven men and five women including two lawyers, a schoolteacher, and a physical therapist -- are expected to begin deliberating on Wednesday morning after Judge Juan Merchan instructs them on the law related to the case.\n\nThe prosecution's case\n\nThe state's case centers around what they argue was a pressing concern for Trump as he announced his candidacy in the 2016 election.\n\n\"There's going to be a lot of women coming forward,\" Cohen testified Trump warned him at the start of the campaign.\n\nAs the campaign gained momentum, prosecutors say Trump engaged in a criminal conspiracy that began with an August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower.\n\nFormer National Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified that during a meeting with Trump and Cohen, he agreed to help the Trump campaign by running positive stories about Trump, pushing negative stories about his opponents, and acting as the campaign's \"eyes and ears\" by flagging negative stories about Trump related to women.\n\n\"If hear anything about women selling stories ... I would notify Michael Cohen and then he would be able to have them killed in another magazine or have them not be published or somebody would have to purchase them,\" Pecker testified.\n\nActing on his agreement with Trump and Cohen, Pecker said that his company paid for two stories, including a $30,000 payment to a former doorman who falsely alleged that Trump had an illegitimate child, and a $150,000 payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal who alleged a months-long affair with Trump, which Trump has steadfastly denied.\n\nPecker told jurors that he had already spent too much on those agreements when he got word in October 2016 that Daniels was selling her story of an alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump that Trump has denied. Pecker testified that he flagged the story to Cohen, who told jurors that he brought the matter directly to Trump.\n\n\"This is really a disaster. Women will hate me. Guys may think it's cool, but this is going to be a disaster for the campaign,\" Cohen testified about Trump's reaction to the story.\n\nProsecutors called Daniels to the witness stand to describe her alleged sexual encounter with Trump, offering details that prosecutors said were necessary for the jury to understand Trump's motivation to kill the story.\n\n\"I told very few people that we had actually had sex because I felt ashamed that I didn't stop it, that I didn't say no,\" Daniels told jurors.\n\nThe possibility of Daniels' allegations becoming public came as Trump's campaign was in crisis mode after the release of the infamous Access Hollywood tape, which prompted some prominent Republicans to withdraw their support for Trump and the Republican National Committee to consider finding a new candidate to replace him, former Trump aide and one-time RNC staffer Madeleine Westerhout testified.\n\nCohen told jurors that he spoke with Trump about the Daniels matter more than 20 times in October 2016. According to Cohen, Trump authorized him to make a $130,000 payment to Daniels pursuant to a nondisclosure agreement, effectively killing the story just days before the 2016 election.\n\nCohen also said that in January 2017, he attended a meeting with Trump and former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg where they agreed on a plan to reimburse Cohen for the Daniels payment and the taxes he would owe on the reimbursement -- as well as his bonus and another expense reimbursement -- through 12 $35,000 payments.\n\nJurors saw each of the invoices submitted by Cohen for legal services pursuant to a retainer agreement, as well as the internal vouchers generated by the Trump Organization to pay Cohen, and the checks signed by Trump and the representatives of his trust. Prosecutors allege that the business records were falsified to disguise the reimbursement for Cohen's payment to Daniels, further hiding the existence of the hush money payment from the public.\n\nThe defense's case\n\nDefense lawyers have sought to distance Trump from the allegedly falsified documents and limit the suggestion that the former president acted with fraudulent intent -- beginning with discrediting the prosecution's star witness, Michael Cohen.\n\n\"He has a goal, an obsession with getting Trump, and you're going to hear that,\" defense lawyer Todd Blanche said during his opening statement. \"I submit to you that he cannot be trusted.\"\n\nAcross three days of cross-examination, defense lawyers painted Cohen as a spiteful employee intent on revenge by highlighting his criminal history, past lies under oath, and animosity toward Trump.\n\nCohen also admitted to stealing $30,000 from the Trump Organization by overcharging the company for an IT expense, and defense lawyers say he lied on the witness stand about an October 2016 phone call that he said he made to confirm with Trump the plan to pay Daniels $130,000.\n\nDefense lawyers also attempted to distance Trump from the creation of the allegedly falsified documents, arguing that the payments were orchestrated by accountants within the Trump Organization after receiving invoices from Cohen.\n\nFor the nine checks that bear Trump's signature, defense lawyers elicited testimony from Westerhout saying that Trump, at times, signed checks without examining them.\n\nAnother former White House aide, communications director Hope Hicks, offered testimony to support the defense's argument that the nondisclosure agreement with Daniels was prompted by Trump's desire to protect his family -- and not done to influence the election.\n\n\"I don't think he wanted anyone in his family to be hurt or embarrassed by anything that was happening on the campaign,\" Hicks said. \"He wanted them to be proud of him.\"",

Trump has denied any sexual encounter took place.\n\nThe prosecution's star witness, ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, also testified that the former president was directly involved in the scheme and authorised payments.\n\nThe defence, for its part, has sought to discredit the witnesses, including by painting Cohen as a serial liar. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to federal charges related to the hush money payments as well as for lying to the US Congress.\n\nBut this week, Trump's team does not have to prove anything or convince jurors of his innocence.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, they need to persuade at least one of the 12 jurors that prosecutors have failed to prove Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt - the standard for criminal cases.\n\nThe defence may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid.\n\nWhile courtroom drama has dominated media coverage of the trial, the case boils down to whether Trump knowingly covered up a $130,000 payment to Daniels for her silence in an effort to prevent her claims from derailing his 2016 White House bid.\n\nThe jury must decide not only if Trump caused the records of payments to be falsified but also if he did so to cover up another crime - an undeclared campaign donation in this case. Both findings would make the alleged offences felonies under New York state law.\n\nIn an interview with Al Jazeera at the outset of the trial, Gregory Germain, a law professor at Syracuse University in upstate New York, summed up \"the two essential elements\" of the indictment: \"Where's the fraud and where's the [secondary] crime?\"\n\nAfter each side delivers its closing arguments, the judge overseeing the case, Juan Merchan, will give the jury lengthy instructions on how to interpret the law and evidence during their deliberations. This could happen as early as Wednesday.\n\nThe deliberations will proceed in secret in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that is intentionally opaque.\n\nDuring their deliberations, the jurors will have access to all of the evidence and will be able to ask questions of the judge, who will confer with prosecutors and defence lawyers before deciding how to answer.\n\nThere is no time limit on how long the jury takes to deliberate. The jurors must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records, so that could take some time, and a verdict might not come by the end of the week.\n\nTo reach a verdict, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it. If the jury is unable to unanimously decide a verdict, it deadlocks, and Merchan would declare a mistrial.\n\nOnce jurors inform the court they have reached a verdict, Merchan will summon the parties to the courtroom to hear it read by the jury foreperson. Merchan must still affirm the verdict and enter a final judgement. Either side may ask him to effectively overrule the jury.\n\nIf Trump is convicted, it would likely be several weeks or months until he is sentenced.\n\nAs a first-time offender of a nonviolent crime, the ex-president and the Republican Party's 2024 presumptive presidential nominee would likely be released on bond in the meantime.\n\nThe maximum sentence for Trump's crime of falsifying business records is up to four years in prison. But while prison time is a possibility, experts said a fine, probation or community service are all far more likely options.\n\nThat remains unclear.\n\nAn ABC News/Ipsos poll from early May found that an overwhelming percentage of Trump supporters - 80 percent - said they would back the former president in November even if he is found guilty of a felony.\n\nBut 16 percent said they would reconsider their support if he is found guilty while 4 percent said they would withdraw it, the poll showed.\n\nAnother poll, published last week by Quinnipiac University, showed that 6 percent of Trump voters said they would be less likely to vote for Trump if he is convicted, 24 percent said they would be more likely to vote for him and 68 percent said it would not affect their choice.\n\nWhile the percentage of voters who said they would ditch Trump if he is convicted is low, it could nevertheless prove important in a neck-and-neck contest between Trump and Biden.\n\n\"Will a conviction sink Trump? The vast majority of his supporters say it would be no big deal. But in an extremely tight race, that 6 percent could tip the balance,\" Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al

If they cannot agree, resulting in a hung jury, prosecutors then would decide whether to retry the case.\n\nFor Trump, the outcome is consequential, not only for his personal freedom but his political fate. He is the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential candidate, set to run again in the November election against President Joe Biden, the Democrat who defeated him in 2020.\n\nNational polls show Biden and Trump locked in a tight contest, but some opinion polls indicate Trump supporters could switch their vote to Biden or not vote at all if the former president is convicted.\n\nIn the criminal case, Trump is accused of sanctioning a scheme in which his political fixer, Michael Cohen, made a $130,000 hush money payment to porn film star Stormy Daniels just ahead of the 2016 election to keep her from talking publicly about her claim of a one-night tryst with Trump at a celebrity golf tourney a decade earlier.\n\nTrump has denied the liaison with Daniels and the 34-count indictment he is facing - falsifying business records at his Trump Organization real estate conglomerate to hide the 2017 reimbursement to Cohen, labeling it as payments for legal work he had done for Trump.\n\nIf convicted, Trump could face probation or be sentenced to up to four years in prison, although he is certain to appeal and could continue to run for the presidency.\n\nTrump is facing three other indictments, including two accusing him of illegally trying to upend his 2020 election loss. But all three cases are tied up in legal wrangling between his lawyers and prosecutors. As a result, the New York case nearing completion may be the only one decided before the November election.\n\nTrump had often said he wanted to testify in his own defense at the trial, but in the end, did not, which was his right.\n\nTrump's team put only two witnesses on the stand. One of them, New York lawyer Robert Costello, said that in 2018, Cohen assured him he had \"nothing on Trump\" and that he, not Trump, concocted the hush money payment deal with Daniels.\n\nEarly in the case, Trump often assailed Cohen and other witnesses, despite Merchan's gag order prohibiting Trump from attacking them and jurors. Merchan excluded himself and prosecutor Alvin Bragg from the edict.\n\nMerchan found Trump in contempt of court 10 times and fined him $10,000, after which Trump seemed to aim his broadsides solely at the judge and prosecutor.\n\nTrump urged several Republican lawmakers to show up in the courtroom in the seats behind the defense table as a show of support. The legislators, including House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, often stayed for an hour or two of testimony and then, because they were not subject to the gag order, walked outside the courthouse and held news conferences to criticize witnesses against Trump, especially Cohen and Daniels.\n\nCohen testified that he did little legal work for Trump in 2017, and that the country's 45th president twice authorized the reimbursement plan and the claim that it was for legal work, once at his Trump Tower in New York before he assumed the presidency and again in the White House Oval Office less than three weeks after he was inaugurated.\n\nBut the question for the jurors is Cohen's credibility.\n\nHe acknowledged during hours of testimony that he has over the years been a serial liar on Trump's behalf and to protect his own wife from tax evasion charges. He said that as part of the hush money reimbursement plan, he stole $60,000 from the Trump company because he felt Trump had shorted him on his year-end 2016 bonus.\n\nCohen testified that with Trump's consent, Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization's then-chief financial officer, \"grossed up\" the overall reimbursement to $420,000, in part to cover Cohen's tax liability, and that the reimbursement was paid out in $35,000 monthly increments in 2017, with Trump signing nine of the 11 checks to Cohen.\n\nDespite his pivotal role in the reimbursement, Weisselberg, now serving a five-month prison sentence for lying under oath in a previous Trump-related business fraud civil case, was not called as a witness by either side.\n\nEarly witnesses in the trial portrayed Cohen as brash, profane and volatile. However, on the witness stand, the 57-year-old disbarred lawyer was reserved and did not erupt under hours of a withering cross-examination by Trump lawyer Todd Blanche.\n\nFor years, Cohen was a Trump loyalist, his lawyer and political fixer who tended to Trump's every whim during his years as a New York real estate magnate and during his 2016 run for the presidency. As news of Daniels' claim of a liaison with Trump and the hush money reimbursement to Cohen became public in 2018, the relationship between the then-president and Cohen ruptured after federal agents raided his then-New York home, a hotel room.\n\nIn the end, Cohen pleaded guilty to perjury in connection with his lying to a congressional panel about a Trump Tower construction project in Moscow that never materialized, tax fraud and a campaign finance law violation linked to the hush money payment to Daniels. He served 13\u00bd months in a federal prison and another year and a half in home confinement.\n\nSince then, he has turned into a persistent Trump critic. He testified pointedly that he hopes Trump is convicted.\n\nDavid Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid newspaper, testified how he agreed in a 2015 Trump Tower meeting with Trump and Cohen to publish positive stories about Trump as he sought the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, along with negative and embarrassing stories about his political opponents, and to keep other inflammatory stories about Trump from being published.\n\nIt was called \"catch and kill\" in the vernacular of the world of tabloid news. In one instance, Pecker said he paid $150,000 to Karen McDougal, Playboy magazine's 1998 Playmate of the Year, to buy the rights to her claim of a 10-month affair with Trump in 2006 and 2007, with no intention of publishing anything about it. Trump denied her claim as well, but prosecutors did not call her as a witness.\n\nA month before the 2016 November election, The Washington Post unearthed a 2005 outtake from the celebrity-driven \"Access Hollywood\" show in which Trump boasted that he could grope women at will because he was a star.\n\nThe emergence of the tape led directly to the hush money payment to Daniels. The Trump campaign was worried that the Access Hollywood footage might offend female voters and that one more sex-related Trump story would be worse. Daniels, at the same time, was hawking her Trump story or wanted money to stay quiet.\n\nCohen said he created a shell company, transferred money into it from his home equity line of credit and wired Daniels' lawyer the $130,000 in hush money just days before the election. Cohen testified Trump told him to \"just do it,\" and Cohen said he would not have made the payment on his own without Trump's assent.\n\nWithin a week, Trump narrowly defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton, a former first lady and U.S. secretary of state, to win a four-year term in the White House.", "source": {"uri": "cambodiantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cambodian Times"},

He is the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential candidate, set to run again in the November election against President Joe Biden, the Democrat who defeated him in 2020.\n\nNational polls show Biden and Trump locked in a tight contest, but some opinion polls indicate Trump supporters could switch their vote to Biden or not vote at all if the former president is convicted.\n\nIn the criminal case, Trump is accused of sanctioning a scheme in which his political fixer, Michael Cohen, made a $130,000 hush money payment to porn film star Stormy Daniels just ahead of the 2016 election to keep her from talking publicly about her claim of a one-night tryst with Trump at a celebrity golf tourney a decade earlier.\n\nTrump has denied the liaison with Daniels and the 34-count indictment he is facing -- falsifying business records at his Trump Organization real estate conglomerate to hide the 2017 reimbursement to Cohen, labeling it as payments for legal work he had done for Trump.\n\nIf convicted, Trump could face probation or be sentenced to up to four years in prison, although he is certain to appeal and could continue to run for the presidency.\n\nTrump is facing three other indictments, including two accusing him of illegally trying to upend his 2020 election loss. But all three cases are tied up in legal wrangling between his lawyers and prosecutors. As a result, the New York case nearing completion may be the only one decided before the November election.\n\nTrump had often said he wanted to testify in his own defense at the trial, but in the end, did not, which was his right.\n\nTrump's team put only two witnesses on the stand. One of them, New York lawyer Robert Costello, said that in 2018, Cohen assured him he had \"nothing on Trump\" and that he, not Trump, concocted the hush money payment deal with Daniels.\n\nEarly in the case, Trump often assailed Cohen and other witnesses, despite Merchan's gag order prohibiting Trump from attacking them and jurors. Merchan excluded himself and prosecutor Alvin Bragg from the edict.\n\nMerchan found Trump in contempt of court 10 times and fined him $10,000, after which Trump seemed to aim his broadsides solely at the judge and prosecutor.\n\nTrump urged several Republican lawmakers to show up in the courtroom in the seats behind the defense table as a show of support. The legislators, including House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, often stayed for an hour or two of testimony and then, because they were not subject to the gag order, walked outside the courthouse and held news conferences to criticize witnesses against Trump, especially Cohen and Daniels.\n\nCohen testified that he did little legal work for Trump in 2017, and that the country's 45th president twice authorized the reimbursement plan and the claim that it was for legal work, once at his Trump Tower in New York before he assumed the presidency and again in the White House Oval Office less than three weeks after he was inaugurated.\n\nBut the question for the jurors is Cohen's credibility.\n\nHe acknowledged during hours of testimony that he has over the years been a serial liar on Trump's behalf and to protect his own wife from tax evasion charges. He said that as part of the hush money reimbursement plan, he stole $60,000 from the Trump company because he felt Trump had shorted him on his year-end 2016 bonus.\n\nCohen testified that with Trump's consent, Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization's then-chief financial officer, \"grossed up\" the overall reimbursement to $420,000, in part to cover Cohen's tax liability, and that the reimbursement was paid out in $35,000 monthly increments in 2017, with Trump signing nine of the 11 checks to Cohen.\n\nDespite his pivotal role in the reimbursement, Weisselberg, now serving a five-month prison sentence for lying under oath in a previous Trump-related business fraud civil case, was not called as a witness by either side.\n\nEarly witnesses in the trial portrayed Cohen as brash, profane and volatile. However, on the witness stand, the 57-year-old disbarred lawyer was reserved and did not erupt under hours of a withering cross-examination by Trump lawyer Todd Blanche.\n\nFor years, Cohen was a Trump loyalist, his lawyer and political fixer who tended to Trump's every whim during his years as a New York real estate magnate and during his 2016 run for the presidency. As news of Daniels' claim of a liaison with Trump and the hush money reimbursement to Cohen became public in 2018, the relationship between the then-president and Cohen ruptured after federal agents raided his then-New York home, a hotel room.\n\nIn the end, Cohen pleaded guilty to perjury in connection with his lying to a congressional panel about a Trump Tower construction project in Moscow that never materialized, tax fraud and a campaign finance law violation linked to the hush money payment to Daniels. He served 13\u00bd months in a federal prison and another year and a half in home confinement.\n\nSince then, he has turned into a persistent Trump critic. He testified pointedly that he hopes Trump is convicted.\n\nDavid Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid newspaper, testified how he agreed in a 2015 Trump Tower meeting with Trump and Cohen to publish positive stories about Trump as he sought the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, along with negative and embarrassing stories about his political opponents, and to keep other inflammatory stories about Trump from being published.\n\nIt was called \"catch and kill\" in the vernacular of the world of tabloid news. In one instance, Pecker said he paid $150,000 to Karen McDougal, Playboy magazine's 1998 Playmate of the Year, to buy the rights to her claim of a 10-month affair with Trump in 2006 and 2007, with no intention of publishing anything about it. Trump denied her claim as well, but prosecutors did not call her as a witness.\n\nA month before the 2016 November election, The Washington Post unearthed a 2005 outtake from the celebrity-driven \"Access Hollywood\" show in which Trump boasted that he could grope women at will because he was a star.\n\nThe emergence of the tape led directly to the hush money payment to Daniels. The Trump campaign was worried that the Access Hollywood footage might offend female voters and that one more sex-related Trump story would be worse. Daniels, at the same time, was hawking her Trump story or wanted money to stay quiet.\n\nCohen said he created a shell company, transferred money into it from his home equity line of credit and wired Daniels' lawyer the $130,000 in hush money just days before the election. Cohen testified Trump told him to \"just do it,\" and Cohen said he would not have made the payment on his own without Trump's assent.\n\nWithin a week, Trump narrowly defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton, a former first lady and U.S. secretary of state, to win a four-year term in the White House.", "source": {"uri": "standardmedia.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "Standard Digital News -

Major week looms in Trump hush money trial", "body": "FILE - Former President Donald Trump appears at Manhattan criminal court, April 16, 2024, in New York. The testimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly [...]\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The testimony in Donald Trump's New York hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict.\n\nIt's impossible to say how long all of that will take, but in a landmark trial that's already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could easily be the most important.\n\nStarting Tuesday morning, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments expected to last for much of the day, if not all of it.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election to a porn star who alleged she had a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nLook for prosecutors to remind jurors that they can trust the financial paperwork they've seen and the witnesses they've heard from. That includes porn actor Stormy Daniels, whose account of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump is at the heart of the case, and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme and authorized payments.\n\nIt's worth remembering that the defense, which called only two witnesses but not Trump, doesn't have to prove anything or convince jurors of Trump's innocence.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nExpect the defense to try to poke holes in the government's case by disputing Daniels' testimony about her hotel suite encounter with Trump and by distancing Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements to Cohen, who was responsible for the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels.\n\nThe defense may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid.\n\nAnd it'll certainly attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand. How much of his testimony the jury believes will go a long way in determining the outcome of the case.\n\nSince the prosecution has the burden of proof, it will deliver its summation last -- the reverse order from opening statements, in which the prosecution went first.\n\nONE LAST THING BEFORE THE JURY DELIBERATES\n\nA critical moment will take place, perhaps Wednesday morning, before the jury begins its deliberations.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nIn an indication of just how important those instructions are, prosecutors and defense lawyers had a spirited debate last week outside the jury's presence as they sought to persuade Merchan about the instructions he should give.\n\nThe Trump team, for instance, sought an instruction informing jurors that the types of hush money payments at issue in Trump's case are not inherently illegal, a request a prosecutor called \"totally inappropriate.\" Merchan said such an instruction would go too far and is unnecessary.\n\nTrump's team also asked Merchan to consider the \"extraordinarily important\" nature of the case when issuing his instructions and to urge jurors to reach \"very specific findings.\" Prosecutors objected to that as well, and Merchan agreed that it would be wrong to deviate from the standard instructions.\n\n\"When you say it's a very important case, you're asking me to change the law, and I'm not going to do that,\" Merchan said.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, requested an instruction that someone's status as a candidate doesn't need to be the sole motivation for making a payment that benefits the campaign. Defense lawyers asked for jurors to be told that if a payment would have been made even if the person wasn't running, it shouldn't be treated as a campaign contribution.\n\nONCE THE JURY GETS THE CASE\n\nThe deliberations will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that's intentionally opaque.\n\nJurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it's hard to read too much into the meaning of any note.\n\nIt's anyone's guess how long the jury will deliberate for and there's no time limit either. The jury must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records, so that could take some time, and a verdict might not come by the end of the week.\n\nTo reach a verdict, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it.\n\nThings will get trickier if the jury can't reach a consensus after several days of deliberations. Though defense lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial, Merchan is likely to call the jurors in and instruct them to keep trying for a verdict and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others.\n\nIf, after that instruction, the jury still can't reach a verdict, the judge would have the option to deem the panel hopelessly deadlocked and declare a mistrial.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jennifer Peltz, Michael R.

Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial.\n\n- Other cases -\n\nAside from Daniels, the key prosecution witness was Michael Cohen, Trump's former \"fixer\" turned bitter foe who arranged the $130,000 hush money payment.\n\nWalking jurors through the reasoning behind the payments, Cohen said they were made \"to ensure that the story would not come out, would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States.\"\n\nTrump's defense team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.\n\nThe defense called only two witnesses of their own before resting.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.\n\nNone of those trials are

Major week looms in Trump hush money trial", "body": "Jurors were sent home until next Tuesday, when closing arguments are expected to take place as we enter the final stages of the Donald Trump hush money trial.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - The testimony in Donald Trump's New York hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict.\n\nIt's impossible to say how long all of that will take, but in a landmark trial that's already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could easily be the most important.\n\nStarting Tuesday morning, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments expected to last for much of the day, if not all of it.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election to a porn star who alleged she had a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nLook for prosecutors to remind jurors that they can trust the financial paperwork they've seen and the witnesses they've heard from. That includes porn actor Stormy Daniels, whose account of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump is at the heart of the case, and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme and authorized payments.\n\nIt's worth remembering that the defense, which called only two witnesses but not Trump, doesn't have to prove anything or convince jurors of Trump's innocence.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nExpect the defense to try to poke holes in the government's case by disputing Daniels' testimony about her hotel suite encounter with Trump and by distancing Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements to Cohen, who was responsible for the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels.\n\nThe defense may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid.\n\nAnd it'll certainly attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand. How much of his testimony the jury believes will go a long way in determining the outcome of the case.\n\nSince the prosecution has the burden of proof, it will deliver its summation last -- the reverse order from opening statements, in which the prosecution went first.\n\nONE LAST THING BEFORE THE JURY DELIBERATES\n\nA critical moment will take place, perhaps Wednesday morning, before the jury begins its deliberations.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nIn an indication of just how important those instructions are, prosecutors and defense lawyers had a spirited debate last week outside the jury's presence as they sought to persuade Merchan about the instructions he should give.\n\nThe Trump team, for instance, sought an instruction informing jurors that the types of hush money payments at issue in Trump's case are not inherently illegal, a request a prosecutor called \"totally inappropriate.\" Merchan said such an instruction would go too far and is unnecessary.\n\nTrump's team also asked Merchan to consider the \"extraordinarily important\" nature of the case when issuing his instructions and to urge jurors to reach \"very specific findings.\" Prosecutors objected to that as well, and Merchan agreed that it would be wrong to deviate from the standard instructions.\n\n\"When you say it's a very important case, you're asking me to change the law, and I'm not going to do that,\" Merchan said.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, requested an instruction that someone's status as a candidate doesn't need to be the sole motivation for making a payment that benefits the campaign. Defense lawyers asked for jurors to be told that if a payment would have been made even if the person wasn't running, it shouldn't be treated as a campaign contribution.\n\nONCE THE JURY GETS THE CASE\n\nThe deliberations will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that's intentionally opaque.\n\nJurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it's hard to read too much into the meaning of any note.\n\nIt's anyone's guess how long the jury will deliberate for and there's no time limit either. The jury must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records, so that could take some time, and a verdict might not come by the end of the week.\n\nTo reach a verdict, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it.\n\nThings will get trickier if the jury can't reach a consensus after several days of deliberations. Though defense lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial, Merchan is likely to call the jurors in and instruct them to keep trying for a verdict and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others.\n\nIf, after that instruction, the jury still can't reach a verdict, the judge would have the option to deem the panel hopelessly deadlocked and declare a mistrial.", "source": {"uri": "fox5ny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 New York"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@fox5ny.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_instructions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury instructions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deliberation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burden of proof (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opening statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Tri-Ominos", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Tri-Ominos", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox5ny.com/www.fox5ny.com/content/uploads/2024/05/1280/720/GettyImages-2151654030.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nLook for prosecutors to remind jurors that they can trust the financial paperwork they've seen and the witnesses they've heard from. That includes porn actor Stormy Daniels, whose account of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump is at the heart of the case, and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme and authorized payments.\n\nIt's worth remembering the defense, which called only two witnesses but not Trump, doesn't have to prove anything or convince jurors of Trump's innocence.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nExpect the defense to try to poke holes in the government's case by disputing Daniels' testimony about her hotel suite encounter with Trump and by distancing Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements to Cohen, who was responsible for the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels.\n\nThe defense may also assert one last time Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid.\n\nAnd it'll certainly attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand. How much of his testimony the jury believes will go a long way in determining the outcome of the case.\n\nSince the prosecution has the burden of proof, it will deliver its summation last -- the reverse order from opening statements, in which the prosecution went first.\n\nOne last thing before the jury deliberates\n\nA critical moment will take place, perhaps Wednesday morning, before the jury begins its deliberations.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nIn an indication of just how important those instructions are, prosecutors and defense lawyers had a spirited debate last week outside the jury's presence as they sought to persuade Merchan about the instructions he should give.\n\nThe Trump team, for instance, sought an instruction informing jurors the types of hush money payments at issue in Trump's case are not inherently illegal, a request a prosecutor called \"totally inappropriate.\" Merchan said such an instruction would go too far and is unnecessary.\n\nTrump's team also asked Merchan to consider the \"extraordinarily important\" nature of the case when issuing his instructions and to urge jurors to reach \"very specific findings.\" Prosecutors objected to that as well, and Merchan agreed that it would be wrong to deviate from the standard instructions.\n\n\"When you say it's a very important case, you're asking me to change the law, and I'm not going to do that,\" Merchan said.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, requested an instruction that someone's status as a candidate doesn't need to be the sole motivation for making a payment that benefits the campaign. Defense lawyers asked for jurors to be told that if a payment would have been made even if the person wasn't running, it shouldn't be treated as a campaign contribution.\n\nOnce the jury gets the case\n\nThe deliberations will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that's intentionally opaque.\n\nJurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it's hard to read too much into the meaning of any note.\n\nIt's anyone's guess how long the jury will deliberate for and there's no time limit either. The jury must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records, so that could take some time, and a verdict might not come by the end of the week.\n\nTo reach a verdict, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it.\n\nThings will get trickier if the jury can't reach a consensus after several days of deliberations. Though defense lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial, Merchan is likely to call the jurors in and instruct them to keep trying for a verdict and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others.\n\nIf, after that instruction, the jury still can't reach a verdict, the judge would have the option to deem the panel hopelessly deadlocked and declare a mistrial.\n\nFILE - Judge Juan M.

As a result, the closing arguments are likely to focus on Trump's awareness of Cohen's conduct, and Trump's motivations for allegedly approving the payments.\n\nProsecutors argue that Trump approved Daniels' hush money payment to influence the election, while defense lawyers pin the arrangement on Cohen and say Trump was simply trying to protect his family. Defense lawyers attempted to cast Cohen's alleged reimbursement after the election as legitimate payments processed by accountants at the Trump Organization, but prosecutors say the payments were disguised to hide their true purpose from voters.\n\nThe jury -- comprised of seven men and five women including two lawyers, a schoolteacher, and a physical therapist -- are expected to begin deliberating on Wednesday morning after Judge Juan Merchan instructs them on the law related to the case.\n\nThe state's case centers around what they argue was a pressing concern for Trump as he announced his candidacy in the 2016 election.\n\n\"There's going to be a lot of women coming forward,\" Cohen testified Trump warned him at the start of the campaign.\n\nAs the campaign gained momentum, prosecutors say Trump engaged in a criminal conspiracy that began with an August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower.\n\nFormer National Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified that during a meeting with Trump and Cohen, he agreed to help the Trump campaign by running positive stories about Trump, pushing negative stories about his opponents, and acting as the campaign's \"eyes and ears\" by flagging negative stories about Trump related to women.\n\n\"If hear anything about women selling stories ... I would notify Michael Cohen and then he would be able to have them killed in another magazine or have them not be published or somebody would have to purchase them,\" Pecker testified.\n\nActing on his agreement with Trump and Cohen, Pecker said that his company paid for two stories, including a $30,000 payment to a former doorman who falsely alleged that Trump had an illegitimate child, and a $150,000 payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal who alleged a months-long affair with Trump, which Trump has steadfastly denied.\n\nPecker told jurors that he had already spent too much on those agreements when he got word in October 2016 that Daniels was selling her story of an alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump that Trump has denied. Pecker testified that he flagged the story to Cohen, who told jurors that he brought the matter directly to Trump.\n\n\"This is really a disaster. Women will hate me. Guys may think it's cool, but this is going to be a disaster for the campaign,\" Cohen testified about Trump's reaction to the story.\n\nProsecutors called Daniels to the witness stand to describe her alleged sexual encounter with Trump, offering details that prosecutors said were necessary for the jury to understand Trump's motivation to kill the story.\n\n\"I told very few people that we had actually had sex because I felt ashamed that I didn't stop it, that I didn't say no,\" Daniels told jurors.\n\nThe possibility of Daniels' allegations becoming public came as Trump's campaign was in crisis mode after the release of the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape, which prompted some prominent Republicans to withdraw their support for Trump and the Republican National Committee to consider finding a new candidate to replace him, former Trump aide and one-time RNC staffer Madeleine Westerhout testified.\n\nCohen told jurors that he spoke with Trump about the Daniels matter more than 20 times in October 2016. According to Cohen, Trump authorized him to make a $130,000 payment to Daniels pursuant to a nondisclosure agreement, effectively killing the story just days before the 2016 election.\n\nCohen also said that in January 2017, he attended a meeting with Trump and former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg where they agreed on a plan to reimburse Cohen for the Daniels payment and the taxes he would owe on the reimbursement -- as well as his bonus and another expense reimbursement -- through twelve $35,000 payments.\n\nJurors saw each of the invoices submitted by Cohen for legal services pursuant to a retainer agreement, as well as the internal vouchers generated by the Trump Organization to pay Cohen, and the checks signed by Trump and the representatives of his trust. Prosecutors allege that the business records were falsified to disguise the reimbursement for Cohen's payment to Daniels, further hiding the existence of the hush money payment from the public.\n\nDefense lawyers have sought to distance Trump from the allegedly falsified documents and limit the suggestion that the former president acted with fraudulent intent -- beginning with discrediting the prosecution's star witness Michael Cohen.\n\n\"He has a goal, an obsession with getting Trump, and you're going to hear that,\" defense lawyer Todd Blanche said during his opening statement. \"I submit to you that he cannot be trusted.\"\n\nAcross three days of cross-examination, defense lawyers painted Cohen as a spiteful employee intent on revenge by highlighting his criminal history, past lies under oath, and animosity toward Trump.\n\nCohen also admitted to stealing $30,000 from the Trump Organization by overcharging the company for an IT expense, and defense lawyers say he lied on the witness stand about an October 2016 phone call that he said he made to confirm with Trump the plan to pay Daniels $130,000.\n\nDefense lawyers also attempted to distance Trump from the creation of the allegedly falsified documents, arguing that the payments were orchestrated by accountants within the Trump Organization after receiving invoices from Cohen.\n\nFor the nine checks that bear Trump's signature, defense lawyers elicited testimony from Westerhout saying that Trump, at times, signed checks without examining them.\n\nAnother former White House aide, communications director Hope Hicks, offered testimony to support the defense's argument that the nondisclosure agreement with Daniels was prompted by Trump's desire to protect his family -- and not done to influence the election.\n\n\"I don't think he wanted anyone in his family to be hurt or embarrassed by anything that was happening on the campaign,\" Hicks said. \"He wanted them to be proud of him.\"",

Jurors will be tasked with deciding whether the allegation that Trump approved of hush money payments and sought to break the law by falsely recording them were part of a broader criminal scheme -- or an effort to avoid embarrassment.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records in connection with payments Michael Cohen made to adult film star Stormy Daniels. The government seeks to convince the jury that Trump sought to conceal the payments in furtherance of another crime and that that is enough to convict him in the legally convoluted case.\n\nHere's what you missed during 20 days in court for the Trump hush money trial:\n\nTrump mouthed \"bull----\" as Daniels recounted the alleged tryst that she said led to her being paid $130,000 days before the 2016 election to stay silent.\n\nBut Trump otherwise said little as a parade of former aides and associates stepped onto the witness stand, where they recounted the events that led prosecutors to charge him with 34 felony counts.\n\nSitting feet away from him, Cohen, his estranged fixer, testified that Trump and his top finance executive were in on a scheme to disguise the reimbursement of his payment to Daniels as a legal retainer. Cohen said that when he later faced legal jeopardy for violating campaign finance law by coordinating the hush money payments, he came under a pressure campaign by people around Trump that he viewed as an attempt to stop him from flipping.\n\nCohen admitted calling Trump a \"boorish cartoon misogynist\" and \"Cheeto-dusted\" villain who should be caged \"like an animal,\" even as he took on a demeanor unrecognizable to people who had known him for years.\n\nA defense attorney, Todd Blanche, urged the judge to \"not let this case go to the jury relying on Mr. Cohen's testimony,\" that of an admitted liar who, during the trial, confessed to stealing tens of thousands of dollars from the Trump Organization.\n\nBlanche sowed doubt about a phone call later in October 2016, when Cohen claimed to have discussed the Daniels payout with Trump, showing the court text messages that suggested Cohen had been speaking with Trump's bodyguard Keith Schiller about prank calls he was receiving at the same time. Cohen responded that he could have discussed both matters during the call.\n\nBlanche also displayed a January 2017 email from the Trump Organization's chief financial officer asking Cohen to \"prepare the agreement we discussed so we can pay you monthly\" after Cohen claimed the repayment plan was meant to be secret and had never been committed to writing.\n\nWhile the email could be read as confirmation that Trump and Allen Weisselberg, then the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, were involved in the plan, it also raised new questions about Cohen's framing of the scheme.\n\nDespite having said he \"absolutely\" planned to testify, Trump ultimately did not. Instead, he sat largely silent at the defense table as smears and accusations flew around the courtroom and lawyers dredged up vivid tales of infidelity, theft and deception.\n\nHitting back at reports that he could be seen sleeping in court, Trump claimed he was simply resting his \"beautiful blue eyes\" while listening \"intensely\" to the proceedings to better \"take it ALL in!!!\"\n\nEarly in the trial, tabloid impresario David Pecker explained how he helped \"catch and kill\" damaging stories about Trump, a plan Pecker said was concocted with Trump and Cohen at a Trump Tower meeting as Trump, his longtime friend, mounted a presidential bid.\n\nBut Pecker did not want to pay for Daniels' story, and he advised Cohen to do so, leading to a scramble to find the money for a deal that Cohen said earned Trump's signoff. In prosecutors' telling, the plan was in service of a scheme to defraud American voters by interfering in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\"No, ma'am,\" Cohen told prosecutors when he was asked whether he would ever have paid for Daniels' nondisclosure agreement on his own.\n\nDaniels also told the court that Cohen sought to stall the payment until after the election, when the story would no longer matter.\n\nLawyers for Trump sought to frame Daniels' demands as an extortion effort.\n\nWhether the jury believes that Cohen was motivated by vengeance or Daniels by profit, as the defense alleged, may not prove consequential.\n\nCohen offered no testimony to connect Trump to the crime of avoiding campaign disclosures, and he was the only witness who said Trump personally discussed the reimbursement.\n\nProsecutors will present their closing arguments Tuesday and try to convince the jury that Trump is guilty of directing a business records cover-up with the intent to commit another crime and that he sought to conceal the commission of that crime.\n\nThe facts of who paid whom and when are not in dispute, with nearly a dozen checks to Cohen signed by Trump having been entered into evidence. Trump denies anything false about the payments -- not that they occurred.\n\nThe burden for Trump's lawyers is lower. The defense will need to sow doubt in jurors' minds that while Trump may have made the payments, the allegation that he orchestrated a broader scheme to influence the election has not been proven.\n\nThe indictment alleges that 11 checks were issued from the Trump Revocable Trust and Trump's personal bank account \"for a phony purpose\" and that, with falsified ledger entries and invoices, they formed the basis of a scheme to \"conceal\" a secret $130,000 payment to Cohen.\n\n\"Each check was processed by the Trump Organization and illegally disguised as a payment for legal services rendered pursuant to a non-existent retainer agreement,\" Bragg's office said.\n\nAfter the defense's closing arguments, state Judge Juan Merchan will instruct the jury on how to interpret the evidence and the law.\n\nDefense witness Robert Costello delivered the final blows to Cohen's credibility from the defense, telling the court that Cohen had repeatedly told him that \"I don't have anything on Donald Trump.\" Cohen told him that \"he did this on his own,\" Costello testified. Cohen said that was because he did not trust Costello.\n\nAs he groused and grumbled on the stand, huffing \"jeez\" amid a sustained objection, Costello tested Merchan's patience. \"Are you staring me down right now?\" Merchan admonished before he momentarily ordered the courtroom cleared.\n\nThe moment presented Trump's allies with fodder to suggest Merchan was acting unfairly against him. Merchan \"showed his bias\" at that moment, alleged law professor Alan Dershowitz, who sat behind Trump last week.\n\nIt did not matter that Costello, under heated cross-examination, squirmed as he was presented with emails and records that exposed his denials as false, including Cohen's claim that Costello had offered a purported back channel to Trump as he faced possible legal jeopardy.\n\nProsecutor Susan Hoffinger produced an email in which Costello wrote to his law partner about the need to get Cohen \"on the right page without giving him the appearance that we are following instructions from Giuliani or the president,\" a reference to former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nFor Trump, who never took the stand himself, Costello offered the defense a chance to impugn Cohen's narrative by someone who heard his claims to the contrary at the time.\n\nTrump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has accused Bragg of carrying out a politically motivated \"witch hunt\" and Cohen as an embittered ex-employee set on targeting him at any cost.\n\nTo deliver that message, Trump has relied on a parade of allies and surrogates -- from the House speaker to potential vice presidential running mates -- to deliver attacks that he is barred from making by a gag order. One group recorded a campaign advertisement from the courthouse.\n\nTrump has also still been able to speak to reporters before the cameras outside the courtroom, and he has launched dozens of fundraising missives during the trial.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(Curtis Means/DailyMail.com via AP, Pool, File)\n\nThe testimony in Donald Trump's New York hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict.\n\nIt's impossible to say how long all of that will take, but in a landmark trial that's already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could easily be the most important.\n\nStarting Tuesday morning, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments expected to last for much of the day, if not all of it.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election to a porn star who alleged she had a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nLook for prosecutors to remind jurors that they can trust the financial paperwork they've seen and the witnesses they've heard from. That includes porn actor Stormy Daniels, whose account of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump is at the heart of the case, and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme and authorized payments.\n\nIt's worth remembering that the defense, which called only two witnesses but not Trump, doesn't have to prove anything or convince jurors of Trump's innocence.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nExpect the defense to try to poke holes in the government's case by disputing Daniels' testimony about her hotel suite encounter with Trump and by distancing Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements to Cohen, who was responsible for the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels.\n\nThe defense may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid.\n\nAnd it'll certainly attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand. How much of his testimony the jury believes will go a long way in determining the outcome of the case.\n\nSince the prosecution has the burden of proof, it will deliver its summation last -- the reverse order from opening statements, in which the prosecution went first.\n\nJury instructions\n\nA critical moment will take place, perhaps Wednesday morning, before the jury begins its deliberations.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nIn an indication of just how important those instructions are, prosecutors and defense lawyers had a spirited debate last week outside the jury's presence as they sought to persuade Merchan about the instructions he should give.\n\nThe Trump team, for instance, sought an instruction informing jurors that the types of hush money payments at issue in Trump's case are not inherently illegal, a request a prosecutor called \"totally inappropriate.\" Merchan said such an instruction would go too far and is unnecessary.\n\nTrump's team also asked Merchan to consider the \"extraordinarily important\" nature of the case when issuing his instructions and to urge jurors to reach \"very specific findings.\" Prosecutors objected to that as well, and Merchan agreed that it would be wrong to deviate from the standard instructions.\n\n\"When you say it's a very important case, you're asking me to change the law, and I'm not going to do that,\" Merchan said.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, requested an instruction that someone's status as a candidate doesn't need to be the sole motivation for making a payment that benefits the campaign. Defense lawyers asked for jurors to be told that if a payment would have been made even if the person wasn't running, it shouldn't be treated as a campaign contribution.\n\nDeliberations, but for how long?\n\nThe deliberations will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that's intentionally opaque.\n\nJurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it's hard to read too much into the meaning of any note.\n\nIt's anyone's guess how long the jury will deliberate for and there's no time limit either. The jury must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records, so that could take some time, and a verdict might not come by the end of the week.\n\nTo reach a verdict, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it.\n\nThings will get trickier if the jury can't reach a consensus after several days of deliberations. Though defense lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial, Merchan is likely to call the jurors in and instruct them to keep trying for a verdict and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others.\n\nIf, after that instruction, the jury still can't reach a verdict, the judge would have the option to deem the panel hopelessly deadlocked and declare a mistrial.", "source": {"uri": "amny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "amNewYork"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@amny.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deliberation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burden of proof (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opening statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_instructions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury instructions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Tri-Ominos", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Tri-Ominos", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.amny.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24146732656102.jpg?w=1200&p=q", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-04-", "textStart": 74, "textEnd": 82}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Though defense lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial, Merchan is likely to call the jurors in and instruct them to keep trying for a verdict and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others.\n\nIf, after that instruction, the jury still can't reach a verdict, the judge would have the option to deem the panel hopelessly deadlocked and declare a mistrial.", "source": {"uri": "rocketcitynow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "rocketcitynow.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@rocketcitynow.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_instructions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury instructions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deliberation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burden of proof (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opening statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Tri-Ominos", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Tri-Ominos", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/CCT/images/d8ef7450-054a-453d-ae10-ba910cca7ffb/20240521T155512/d8ef7450-054a-453d-ae10-ba910cca7ffb_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

of becoming president of the United States.\"\n\nTrump's defense team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.\n\nThe defense called only two witnesses of their own before resting.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.\n\nNone of those trials are

Major week looms in Trump hush money trial", "body": "Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms in Trump hush money trial\n\nERIC TUCKER\n\nMay 28, 2024 at 1:11 AM\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The testimony in Donald Trump's New York hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict.\n\nIt's impossible to say how long all of that will take, but in a landmark trial that's already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could easily be the most important.\n\nHere's what to expect in the days ahead:\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nStarting Tuesday morning, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments expected to last for much of the day, if not all of it.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election to a porn star who alleged she had a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nLook for prosecutors to remind jurors that they can trust the financial paperwork they've seen and the witnesses they've heard from. That includes porn actor Stormy Daniels, whose account of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump is at the heart of the case, and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme and authorized payments.\n\nIt's worth remembering that the defense, which called only two witnesses but not Trump, doesn't have to prove anything or convince jurors of Trump's innocence.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nExpect the defense to try to poke holes in the government's case by disputing Daniels' testimony about her hotel suite encounter with Trump and by distancing Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements to Cohen, who was responsible for the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels.\n\nThe defense may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid.\n\nAnd it'll certainly attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand.

His attorney at the time, Michael Cohen, paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, in exchange for her silence about an alleged affair. Trump has denied the allegation.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Cohen was reimbursed by Trump in a series of 12 monthly payments from the Trump Organization that were logged and characterised as checks for ongoing legal services.\n\nTrump's attorneys presented a brief defence case, calling only two witnesses, and attempted to undermine crucial witnesses such as Cohen and Daniels.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIt's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nTrump's lawyers have insisted that the payments made to Cohen were legitimate payments for legal services, saying their client's celebrity status made him a target for extortion.\n\nThey are expected to revisit these points during their closing arguments Tuesday.\n\nHowever, Cohen testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions and quoted Trump as saying, \"Just pay it\".\n\nCohen admitted to stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases against the former president as he seeks to contest the next presidential election against President Joe Biden.\n\nOther cases centre on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his private residence and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nEarlier in May, SaharaReporters reported that a New York state court upheld the gag order preventing Trump from publicly criticising witnesses and others involved in his hush-money case.\n\nTrump had repeatedly criticised the order and described it as a violation of his First Amendment rights.\n\nIn April, Judge Juan M. Merchan fined Trump $9,000 for repeatedly violating the gag order and warned that he could be jailed if he violated the gag order again.\n\nBut in May, the court held that in his ruling, Judge Merchan properly weighed Trump's First Amendment right to free speech \"against the court's historical commitment to ensuring the fair administration of justice in criminal cases.\"", "source": {"uri": "saharareporters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sahara Reporters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gag order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

The defense, aiming to create doubt, disputes key testimonies while the prosecution focuses on proving Trump's involvement in falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments.\n\nThe testimony in Donald Trump's New York hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict.\n\nIt's impossible to say how long all of that will take, but in a landmark trial that's already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could easily be the most important.\n\nHere's what to expect in the days ahead: WHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS? Starting Tuesday morning, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments expected to last for much of the day, if not all of it.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election to a porn star who alleged she had a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nLook for prosecutors to remind jurors that they can trust the financial paperwork they've seen and the witnesses they've heard from. That includes porn actor Stormy Daniels, whose account of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump is at the heart of the case, and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme and authorized payments.\n\nIt's worth remembering that the defense, which called only two witnesses but not Trump, doesn't have to prove anything or convince jurors of Trump's innocence.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nExpect the defense to try to poke holes in the government's case by disputing Daniels' testimony about her hotel suite encounter with Trump and by distancing Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements to Cohen, who was responsible for the USD 1,30,000 hush money payment to Daniels.\n\nThe defense may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid.\n\nAnd it'll certainly attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand. How much of his testimony the jury believes will go a long way in determining the outcome of the case.\n\nSince the prosecution has the burden of proof, it will deliver its summation last -- the reverse order from opening statements, in which the prosecution went first.\n\nONE LAST THING BEFORE THE JURY DELIBERATES A critical moment will take place, perhaps Wednesday morning, before the jury begins its deliberations.\n\nJudge Juan M Merchan is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nIn an indication of just how important those instructions are, prosecutors and defense lawyers had a spirited debate last week outside the jury's presence as they sought to persuade Merchan about the instructions he should give.\n\nThe Trump team, for instance, sought an instruction informing jurors that the types of hush money payments at issue in Trump's case are not inherently illegal, a request a prosecutor called \"totally inappropriate.\" Merchan said such an instruction would go too far and is unnecessary.\n\nTrump's team also asked Merchan to consider the \"extraordinarily important\" nature of the case when issuing his instructions and to urge jurors to reach \"very specific findings.\" Prosecutors objected to that as well, and Merchan agreed that it would be wrong to deviate from the standard instructions.\n\n\"When you say it's a very important case, you're asking me to change the law, and I'm not going to do that,\" Merchan said.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, requested an instruction that someone's status as a candidate doesn't need to be the sole motivation for making a payment that benefits the campaign. Defense lawyers asked for jurors to be told that if a payment would have been made even if the person wasn't running, it shouldn't be treated as a campaign contribution.\n\nONCE THE JURY GETS THE CASE The deliberations will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that's intentionally opaque.\n\nJurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it's hard to read too much into the meaning of any note.\n\nIt's anyone's guess how long the jury will deliberate for and there's no time limit either. The jury must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records, so that could take some time, and a verdict might not come by the end of the week.\n\nTo reach a verdict on any given count, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it.\n\nThings will get trickier if the jury can't reach a consensus after several days of deliberations. Though defense lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial, Merchan is likely to call the jurors in and instruct them to keep trying for a verdict and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others.\n\nIf, after that instruction, the jury still can't reach a verdict, the judge would have the option to deem the panel hopelessly deadlocked and declare a mistrial.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deliberation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burden of proof (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opening statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/23_05_2024_09_49_07_1255394.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Each side will weave together five weeks of evidence and testimony to make a case for the first-ever conviction or acquittal of a former U.S. president.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in order to conceal or commit another crime. Prosecutors argue Trump falsified records tied to reimbursing his then-lawyer, Michael Cohen, for an unlawful $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nClosing arguments can be crucial for helping jurors understand whether the testimony and evidence they have heard adds up to a compelling case.\n\nFinally, jurors will hear the judges' instructions on the law they should apply in the case.\n\nTo win a conviction, prosecutors have to prove not only that Trump falsified business records, but also that his motivation was to hide the violation of federal campaign finance laws in 2016 or hide a plan to violate New York tax or election laws. The alleged campaign finance violation was the $130,000 hush money, which prosecutors say was a campaign contribution that exceeded the $2,700 legal limit. Cohen pleaded guilty to that federal crime in 2018.\n\nThese are the key questions the closing arguments will address and jurors will be asked to decide:\n\nIs Trump responsible for falsifying records tied to hush money?\n\nThe 34 allegedly falsified records in the case are checks, vouchers, and invoices tied to a series of $35,000 payments to Cohen in 2017. Prosecutors say the payments were mischaracterized as 2017 legal expenses under a non-existent agreement to retain Cohen's services. The payments were actually reimbursing Cohen for the hush money and another expense, as well as giving him an extra bonus.\n\nMichael Cohen was a star prosecution witness for a reason: he had more to say than anyone else in the trial about Trump's alleged participation in both paying the hush money and covering it up. Cohen testified that Trump approved the falsified reimbursement scheme during a meeting with Cohen and then-Trump Organization executive Allen Weisselberg in early 2017. Cohen also testified that Trump authorized the hush money to Daniels - saying \"Just do it\" - in October of 2016.\n\nProsecutors are likely to point to evidence from trial that bolsters Cohen's testimony, such as Trump's own signature - according to testimony from multiple witnesses who worked with him - on many of the checks to Cohen.\n\nProsecutors will probably also point to statements by Trump that suggest he would be paying attention to invoices from Cohen and to what his own checks were for. For instance, a book publisher read aloud these statements from Trump's 2005 book, \"Trump: Think Like a Billionaire\":\n\n\"I always sign my checks, so I know where my money's going\" and \"I also always try to read my bills to make sure I'm not being over-charged,\" Trump said.\n\n\"Pay attention to the small numbers in your finances, such as percentages and cents,\" Trump said.\n\n\"Always look at the numbers yourself,\" Trump said.\n\n\"(Even) though various payments always need to be made, always question invoices and never accept a contractor's first bid,\" Trump said.\n\n\"When you sign a check yourself, you're seeing what's really going on inside your business, and if people see your signature at the bottom of the check, they know you're watching them, and they screw you less because they have proof that you care about the details,\" Trump said.\n\nProsecutors are also likely to remind jurors of notes they saw that former Trump Organization executive Jeffrey McConney said were drafted by Weisselberg and outlined the calculation of payments to Cohen, including doubling the $130,000 hush money payment to account for taxes.\n\nAnd prosecutors may try to bolster the notion that Trump was kept abreast of the Stormy Daniels hush money deal by pointing to an audio recording from the trial that allegedly involves Cohen and Trump talking about an earlier $150,000 hush money deal to quiet former Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nIn the somewhat cryptic conversation, Cohen references \"our friend David\" and \"financing,\" while Trump appears to ask about paying \"150\" and instructs not to pay with cash. Cohen testified he made the recording to reassure tabloid publisher David Pecker that Trump planned to re-pay him for the hush money.\n\nWhat will Trump's defense tell jurors about records?\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche gave a preview last week of what his team may argue to jurors. Blanche urged Judge Juan Merchan to toss out the entire case, saying the business records \"were not false\" because Cohen agreed he supplied Trump with legal services in 2017.\n\nTrump's team is also likely to tell jurors that Michael Cohen is a liar - so they can't trust his testimony that the payments were actually reimbursing hush money, not paying for ongoing legal services. They may remind jurors that Cohen previously pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and making false statements to a bank.\n\nRobert Costello - one of just two witnesses the defense called in the trial - may be a key focus in challenging Cohen's testimony. Costello quoted Cohen as having said: \"I swear to God, Bob, I don't have anything on Donald Trump.\" Meanwhile, Cohen said Costello was trying to create a back channel of communication to Trump, and he didn't trust the \"sketchy\" lawyer.\n\nWas this an attempt to hide unlawful election interference?\n\nProsecutors need to prove not just that Trump falsified business records, but also that he was trying to commit or conceal another crime. Their leading argument throughout the trial has been that Trump was trying to hide unlawfully interfering in the 2016 election. \"It was election fraud, pure and simple,\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told jurors in his opening statement.\n\nThat argument turns on whether the hush money payment to Daniels violated federal campaign finance laws. A key issue in answering that question will be whether the hush money was about the campaign, as opposed to protecting Trump's marriage or family life.\n\nIn fact, former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards escaped conviction in his own criminal case on campaign finance charges by arguing that nearly $1 million from donors that was used to conceal an affair and illegitimate child during his campaign was aimed at shielding his actions from his cancer-stricken wife.\n\nThe prosecution in Trump's case may point to a series of statements from witnesses at trial to make their case:\n\nMichael Cohen testified that Trump urged him to delay paying Daniels until after the election, and then not pay her at all, saying if he lost the election, he \"wouldn't care\" about the story.\n\nDaniels' former lawyer, Keith Davidson, backed up the testimony about Cohen delaying payment so much that he questioned whether they would get the money at all. Davidson said Cohen only paid less than two weeks before the election, at a time when Davidson believed Daniels really was going to go public, potentially with ABC News.\n\nJurors also heard a recording of Davidson claiming to Cohen that Daniels told him he \"better settle this God damn story\" because if Trump loses the election, \"we lose all (expletive) leverage.\"\n\nKinsey Crowley \u00b7 F17 - E\n\nCohen also testified that Trump wasn't thinking about his wife, Melania. Trump said, according to Cohen, that if she left him over the Daniels scandal, he wouldn't be on the market long.\n\nDavid Pecker testified \"the conversations that I had directly with Mr. Trump, his family wasn't mentioned.\" Pecker said of one conversation in particular: \"It was basically, what would be - the impact be - to the campaign or election.\"\n\nFormer top White House aide Hope Hicks testified about a post-2016 election story about the hush money to Daniels. She said Trump asked for her thoughts on how an earlier story before the election would have compared has Cohen not paid the hush money. \"I think Mr. Trump's opinion was it was better to be dealing with it now, and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election,\" she said.\n\nWhat will the Trump defense team say?\n\nTrump's defense team appears poised to argue Trump didn't know about the hush money payment ahead of time. In his cross-examination of Cohen, Blanche displayed text messages suggesting a call from Cohen to Trump's bodyguard was to talk about harassment from a 14-year-old, not to get Trump on the phone about the Daniels hush money deal. Cohen said he believed he also discussed the deal with Trump.\n\nIn addition, the defense team could say there's no clear evidence the hush money payment was focused on the election. Hope Hicks testified that Trump was \"concerned\" about how a November, 2016 story on the hush money deal involving McDougal would be viewed by Melania Trump, and wanted Hicks to make sure newspapers weren't delivered to the Trump residence that morning.\n\nAnother former Trump White House aide, Madeleine Westerhout, also testified to admiring Trump's relationship with his wife, although she also said she didn't observe any change in the relationship after the Wall Street Journal reported on the Stormy Daniels hush money deal broke in 2018.\n\nWas this an attempt to hide a plan to violate state election and tax laws?\n\nProsecutors are likely to also argue there are alternative options for convicting Trump, even if jurors don't find that he falsified records in order to cover up the violation of federal campaign finance laws.\n\nIn pre-trial filings, prosecutors said Trump was also planning on violating a New York election law by using \"unlawful means\" to promote Trump's presidential election. And they said he was planning on committing tax fraud by doubling the reimbursement to Cohen to account for taxes.\n\nThe Trump team, on the other hand, will likely say the business records weren't covering up any crime.\n\n\"There is simply no evidence that there is any effort to conceal anything by - not only by President Trump, but also by any of the others involved,\" Blanche already told Merchan in his unsuccessful attempt to get the case tossed out.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Historic Trump criminal trial reaches critical day: closing arguments", "source":

Major week looms in Trump hush money trial - Boston News, Weather, Sports | WHDH 7News", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- The testimony in Donald Trump's New York hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict.\n\nIt's impossible to say how long all of that will take, but in a landmark trial that's already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could easily be the most important.\n\nHere's what to expect in the days ahead:\n\nWhat happens during closing arguments?\n\nStarting Tuesday morning, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments expected to last for much of the day, if not all of it.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election to a porn star who alleged she had a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nLook for prosecutors to remind jurors that they can trust the financial paperwork they've seen and the witnesses they've heard from. That includes porn actor Stormy Daniels, whose account of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump is at the heart of the case, and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme and authorized payments.\n\nIt's worth remembering that the defense, which called only two witnesses but not Trump, doesn't have to prove anything or convince jurors of Trump's innocence.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nExpect the defense to try to poke holes in the government's case by disputing Daniels' testimony about her hotel suite encounter with Trump and by distancing Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements to Cohen, who was responsible for the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels.\n\nThe defense may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid.\n\nAnd it'll certainly attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand. How much of his testimony the jury believes will go a long way in determining the outcome of the case.\n\nSince the prosecution has the burden of proof, it will deliver its summation last -- the reverse order from opening statements, in which the prosecution went first.\n\nOne last thing before the jury deliberates\n\nA critical moment will take place, perhaps Wednesday morning, before the jury begins its deliberations.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nIn an indication of just how important those instructions are, prosecutors and defense lawyers had a spirited debate last week outside the jury's presence as they sought to persuade Merchan about the instructions he should give.\n\nThe Trump team, for instance, sought an instruction informing jurors that the types of hush money payments at issue in Trump's case are not inherently illegal, a request a prosecutor called \"totally inappropriate.\" Merchan said such an instruction would go too far and is unnecessary.\n\nTrump's team also asked Merchan to consider the \"extraordinarily important\" nature of the case when issuing his instructions and to urge jurors to reach \"very specific findings.\" Prosecutors objected to that as well, and Merchan agreed that it would be wrong to deviate from the standard instructions.\n\n\"When you say it's a very important case, you're asking me to change the law, and I'm not going to do that,\" Merchan said.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, requested an instruction that someone's status as a candidate doesn't need to be the sole motivation for making a payment that benefits the campaign. Defense lawyers asked for jurors to be told that if a payment would have been made even if the person wasn't running, it shouldn't be treated as a campaign contribution.\n\nOnce the jury gets the case\n\nThe deliberations will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that's intentionally opaque.\n\nJurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it's hard to read too much into the meaning of any note.\n\nIt's anyone's guess how long the jury will deliberate for and there's no time limit either. The jury must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records, so that could take some time, and a verdict might not come by the end of the week.\n\nTo reach a verdict, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it.\n\nThings will get trickier if the jury can't reach a consensus after several days of deliberations. Though defense lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial, Merchan is likely to call the jurors in and instruct them to keep trying for a verdict and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others.\n\nIf, after that instruction, the jury still can't reach a verdict, the judge would have the option to deem the panel hopelessly deadlocked and declare a mistrial.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments Tuesday.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they won't be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence -- and there were many. Judge Juan M. Merchan, for instance, fined Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases Trump is confronting as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nWhere each Trump case stands Classified documents case Election interference Hush-money scheme Georgia election indictment Arizona election indictment Civil cases\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Major week looms in Trump hush money trial", "body": "The testimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict.\n\nIt's impossible to say how long all of that will take, but in a landmark trial that's already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could easily be the most important.\n\nHere's what to expect in the days ahead:\n\nStarting Tuesday morning, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments expected to last for much of the day, if not all of it.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election to a porn star who alleged she had a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier. They'll instead function as hours-long recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nLook for prosecutors to remind jurors that they can trust the financial paperwork they've seen and the witnesses they've heard from. That includes porn actor Stormy Daniels, whose account of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump is at the heart of the case, and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme and authorized payments.\n\nIt's worth remembering that the defense, which called only two witnesses but not Trump, doesn't have to prove anything or convince jurors of Trump's innocence.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nExpect the defense to try to poke holes in the government's case by disputing Daniels' testimony about her hotel suite encounter with Trump and by distancing Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements to Cohen, who was responsible for the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels.\n\nThe defense may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid.\n\nAnd it'll certainly attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand. How much of his testimony the jury believes will go a long way in determining the outcome of the case.\n\nSince the prosecution has the burden of proof, it will deliver its summation last -- the reverse order from opening statements, in which the prosecution went first.\n\nA critical moment will take place, perhaps Wednesday morning, before the jury begins its deliberations.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a road map for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nIn an indication of just how important those instructions are, prosecutors and defense lawyers had a spirited debate last week outside the jury's presence as they sought to persuade Merchan about the instructions he should give.\n\nThe Trump team, for instance, sought an instruction informing jurors that the types of hush money payments at issue in Trump's case are not inherently illegal, a request a prosecutor called \"totally inappropriate.\" Merchan said such an instruction would go too far and is unnecessary.\n\nTrump's team also asked Merchan to consider the \"extraordinarily important\" nature of the case when issuing his instructions and to urge jurors to reach \"very specific findings.\" Prosecutors objected to that as well, and Merchan agreed that it would be wrong to deviate from the standard instructions.\n\n\"When you say it's a very important case, you're asking me to change the law, and I'm not going to do that,\" Merchan said.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, requested an instruction that someone's status as a candidate doesn't need to be the sole motivation for making a payment that benefits the campaign. Defense lawyers asked for jurors to be told that if a payment would have been made even if the person wasn't running, it shouldn't be treated as a campaign contribution.\n\nThe deliberations will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that's intentionally opaque.\n\nJurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it's hard to read too much into the meaning of any note.\n\nIt's anyone's guess how long the jury will deliberate for and there's no time limit either. The jury must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records, so that could take some time, and a verdict might not come by the end of the week.\n\nTo reach a verdict, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it.\n\nThings will get trickier if the jury can't reach a consensus after several days of deliberations. Though defense lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial, Merchan is likely to call the jurors in and instruct them to keep trying for a verdict and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others.\n\nIf, after that instruction, the jury still can't reach a verdict, the judge would have the option to deem the panel hopelessly deadlocked and declare a mistrial.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burden of proof (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opening statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Tri-Ominos", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Tri-Ominos", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8d7214f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2374x1335+0+180/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fab%2F26%2F2ffbcca8aef012c74a7886595daa%2F4bb1e89ed0784faaa9c6a00826727864", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Twelve Manhattan residents will then be tasked with rendering the first criminal verdict on the conduct of a former president in United States history.\n\nThe arguments - also referred to as \"summations\" - allow the two sides to bring together the vast amount of testimony and evidence jurors have taken in over five weeks. Prosecutors will argue that the evidence establishes beyond any reasonable doubt that Trump falsified business records in order to conceal or commit another crime, while the defense team will say it comes up short.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's live updates from inside and outside the Manhattan courtroom:\n\nWho goes first in closing arguments?\n\nUnder New York law, the defense team gives its closing argument first, followed by the prosecution. After both sides have spoken to the jurors, Judge Juan Merchan will instruct them on the law to apply in the case.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump posted a series of messages Monday, on the eve of closing arguments in his New York hush money trial, railing against the case as election interference and quoting scripture.\n\nBesides criticizing Judge Juan Merchan and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Trump questioned why the prosecution gets the final word before jury deliberations. Typically in summing up the evidence in a case, prosecutors make their statements, defense lawyers speak and prosecutors get a final rebuttal because they have the burden of proving their case.\n\n\"Big advantage, very unfair,\" Trump said in an all-caps post on Truth Social.\n\nTrump also quoted a passage from the book of John in the Bible about personal sacrifice. Trump and his supporters have described his four criminal cases as political persecution.\n\n\"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,\" the post said.\n\nEach count against Trump carries a maximum penalty of four years in prison and no minimum amount of jail or prison time. If Trump is convicted on all counts, Merchan will be tasked with deciding on a sentence for each count, and also deciding whether the sentences will coincide with each other or be run one after the other. However, New York law caps sentences for Class E felonies such as those Trump is charged with at 20 years.\n\nLegal experts told USA TODAY it's possible Trump could get just probation, even if he were convicted on every count. Most predicted any incarceration sentence on each count would run simultaneously with the others, so Trump wouldn't be ordered to serve more than four years behind bars. Experts also said Trump would likely be free while his expected appeal ran its course.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in order to conceal or commit another crime. The records - including checks, vouchers, and invoices - all relate to payments to former Trump lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen in 2017. Prosecutors say the payments were reimbursing Cohen for $130,000 in hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016, but the records were falsified to make the payments look like 2017 legal expenses.\n\nProsecutors say Trump was covering up the violation of federal campaign finance laws through the hush money, which was handed over less than two weeks before the 2016 presidential election.

Twelve Manhattan residents will then be tasked with rendering the first criminal verdict on the conduct of a former president in United States history.\n\nThe arguments - also referred to as \"summations\" - allow the two sides to bring together the vast amount of testimony and evidence jurors have taken in over five weeks. Prosecutors will argue that the evidence establishes beyond any reasonable doubt that Trump falsified business records in order to conceal or commit another crime, while the defense team will say it comes up short.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's live updates from inside and outside the Manhattan courtroom:\n\nTrump rails against trial, quotes scripture\n\nFormer President Donald Trump posted a series of messages Monday, on the eve of closing arguments in his New York hush money trial, railing against the case as election interference and quoting scripture.\n\nBesides criticizing Judge Juan Merchan and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Trump questioned why the prosecution gets the final word before jury deliberations. Typically in summing up the evidence in a case, prosecutors make their statements, defense lawyers speak and prosecutors get a final rebuttal because they have the burden of proving their case.\n\n\"Big advantage, very unfair,\" Trump said in an all-caps post on Truth Social.\n\nTrump also quoted a passage from the book of John in the Bible about personal sacrifice. Trump and his supporters have described his four criminal cases as political persecution.\n\n\"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,\" the post said.\n\nEach count against Trump carries a maximum penalty of four years in prison and no minimum amount of jail or prison time. If Trump is convicted on all counts, Merchan will be tasked with deciding on a sentence for each count, and also deciding whether the sentences will coincide with each other or be run one after the other. However, New York law caps sentences for Class E felonies such as those Trump is charged with at 20 years.\n\nLegal experts told USA TODAY it's possible Trump could get just probation, even if he were convicted on every count. Most predicted any incarceration sentence on each count would run simultaneously with the others, so Trump wouldn't be ordered to serve more than four years behind bars. Experts also said Trump would likely be free while his expected appeal ran its course.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in order to conceal or commit another crime. The records - including checks, vouchers, and invoices - all relate to payments to former Trump lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen in 2017. Prosecutors say the payments were reimbursing Cohen for $130,000 in hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016, but the records were falsified to make the payments look like 2017 legal expenses.\n\nProsecutors say Trump was covering up the violation of federal campaign finance laws through the hush money, which was handed over less than two weeks before the 2016 presidential election. They also say Trump was trying to hide a plan to violate New York tax and election laws.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty, and Trump defense lawyer Todd Blanche has denied the payments were reimbursing the hush money.\n\n- Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhy does Trump's team say the case should be dismissed?\n\nJudge Juan Merchan may issue a ruling today on Trump's request to toss out the entire case ahead of jury deliberations.\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche told Merchan that prosecutors haven't put on enough evidence for the case to go to the jury because the business records at issue weren't false.

Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial.\n\nAside from Daniels, the key prosecution witness was Michael Cohen, Trump's former \"fixer\" turned bitter foe who said he arranged the $130,000 hush money payment so her story \"would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States.\"\n\nTrump's defense team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.\n\nNone of those trials are expected to take place before the November election.\n\ncl/bjt/st\n\nMore from this section\n\nAt least 22 dead in Memorial Day weekend storms that devastated several US states\n\nClosing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict?

The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments Tuesday.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they won't be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence -- and there were many. Judge Juan M. Merchan, for instance, fined Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases Trump is confronting as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nWhere each Trump case stands Classified documents case Election interference Hush-money scheme Georgia election indictment Arizona election indictment Civil cases\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Major week looms in Trump hush money trial", "body": "Testimony in Donald Trump's New York hush money trial is wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The testimony in Donald Trump's New York hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict.\n\nIt's impossible to say how long all of that will take, but in a landmark trial that's already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could easily be the most important.\n\nHere's what to expect in the days ahead:\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nStarting Tuesday morning, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments expected to last for much of the day, if not all of it.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election to a porn star who alleged she had a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nLook for prosecutors to remind jurors that they can trust the financial paperwork they've seen and the witnesses they've heard from. That includes porn actor Stormy Daniels, whose account of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump is at the heart of the case, and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme and authorized payments.\n\nIt's worth remembering that the defense, which called only two witnesses but not Trump, doesn't have to prove anything or convince jurors of Trump's innocence.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nExpect the defense to try to poke holes in the government's case by disputing Daniels' testimony about her hotel suite encounter with Trump and by distancing Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements to Cohen, who was responsible for the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels.\n\nThe defense may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid.\n\nAnd it'll certainly attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand. How much of his testimony the jury believes will go a long way in determining the outcome of the case.\n\nSince the prosecution has the burden of proof, it will deliver its summation last -- the reverse order from opening statements, in which the prosecution went first.\n\nONE LAST THING BEFORE THE JURY DELIBERATES\n\nA critical moment will take place, perhaps Wednesday morning, before the jury begins its deliberations.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nIn an indication of just how important those instructions are, prosecutors and defense lawyers had a spirited debate last week outside the jury's presence as they sought to persuade Merchan about the instructions he should give.\n\nThe Trump team, for instance, sought an instruction informing jurors that the types of hush money payments at issue in Trump's case are not inherently illegal, a request a prosecutor called \"totally inappropriate.\" Merchan said such an instruction would go too far and is unnecessary.\n\nTrump's team also asked Merchan to consider the \"extraordinarily important\" nature of the case when issuing his instructions and to urge jurors to reach \"very specific findings.\" Prosecutors objected to that as well, and Merchan agreed that it would be wrong to deviate from the standard instructions.\n\n\"When you say it's a very important case, you're asking me to change the law, and I'm not going to do that,\" Merchan said.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, requested an instruction that someone's status as a candidate doesn't need to be the sole motivation for making a payment that benefits the campaign. Defense lawyers asked for jurors to be told that if a payment would have been made even if the person wasn't running, it shouldn't be treated as a campaign contribution.\n\nONCE THE JURY GETS THE CASE\n\nThe deliberations will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that's intentionally opaque.\n\nJurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it's hard to read too much into the meaning of any note.\n\nIt's anyone's guess how long the jury will deliberate for and there's no time limit either. The jury must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records, so that could take some time, and a verdict might not come by the end of the week.\n\nTo reach a verdict, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it.\n\nThings will get trickier if the jury can't reach a consensus after several days of deliberations. Though defense lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial, Merchan is likely to call the jurors in and instruct them to keep trying for a verdict and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others.\n\nIf, after that instruction, the jury still can't reach a verdict, the judge would have the option to deem the panel hopelessly deadlocked and declare a mistrial.\n\nAssociated Press writers Jennifer Peltz, Michael R.

He is charged with falsifying business records to conceal a hush money payment to a porn star in the weeks before voters that year would decide whether to elect him. They ended up handing him a stunning win.\n\nProsecutors say Trump directed his allies to quell bad press at all costs - the payment was made in order to keep the story from becoming public - because just one more scandal could upend his presidential aspirations. But defense attorneys contend Trump maintained a degree of separation from his allies working to launch him to the nation's highest office, unaware of any unlawful schemes they engaged in to get him there.\n\nAfter more than four weeks of testimony in Trump's criminal trial, from 22 witnesses who once made up his innermost circle, the former president's jury is expected to start weighing his innocence this week after closing arguments conclude on Tuesday.\n\nTrump's jury is a melting pot of Manhattanites - from a physical therapist to investment bankers and immigrants to lifelong New Yorkers.\n\nThey were selected to hear Trump's case over the course of four days in April, a process complicated by his controversial political reputation, deep ties to New York City and intense media coverage.\n\nBetween the seven men and five women on the jury, most are college-educated and follow a myriad of news outlets. Notably, two jurors are themselves lawyers.\n\nThough having lawyers on the panel might seem ideal in a case as complicated and high stakes as Trump's, it could prove to be a \"double-edged sword,\" said Jeremy Saland, a former Manhattan prosecutor.\n\n\"You don't want the lawyer, who may be educated and understand the law, to impose for their own use of the law or reading of the law or understanding of the law on the rest of the jury,\" Saland said. \"And even if it's not intentional, you don't want the jury to rely on that lawyer to say, 'Oh, okay, that's what it means.' Or, 'Oh, thanks for explaining that area of law.'\n\n\"Even if it's not intentional, you don't want to give too much heft or weight; they are just as equal,\" he continued. \"This isn't an Orwellian novel - you know, 'all jurors are equal, and some jurors are more equal than others.'\"\n\nOnce the jury retires to deliberation, lawyers serving among the 12 have equal chance of helping or hindering prosecutors in the Manhattan district attorney's case, said Loyola Marymount University law professor Jessica Levinson.\n\nProsecutors may be hoping the lawyer-jurors will act as their \"teaching assistants\" inside the deliberation room, Levinson said, walking jurors through several complicated steps to determine whether to convict Trump on what amounts to complicated campaign finance violations.\n\nHowever, they could just as easily point to the numerous elements jurors must unanimously agree upon to find Trump guilty and suggest that, if they fail to concur on just one, \"the whole thing breaks apart,\" she said.\n\nThere are several looming questions jurors must answer that could make or break the case.\n\nWhen the National Enquirer and its then-publisher, David Pecker, buried negative stories about Trump and highlighted bad news about his 2016 opponents, did they act in the interest of selling magazines or clearing Trump's path to the White House?\n\nWas porn actress Stormy Daniels detailed testimony about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump unnecessary in a case about falsifying business records - or did it prove that Trump had something to hide from voters?\n\nAnd perhaps most pertinent of all: Is Michael Cohen credible?\n\nAs Trump's ex-fixer who paid to keep Daniels quiet and coordinated other hush money deals, Cohen was the district attorney's star witness and the last to take the stand in his case-in-chief.\n\nBefore jurors ever met Cohen, they were warned by prosecutors he has \"some baggage.\"\n\nNumerous witnesses called Cohen a \"jerk,\" an \"asshole\" and challenging to work with -- to the point that some sought to actively avoid him. The one-time personal attorney to Trump also pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance and other charges in connection with the plot in which Trump is now charged.\n\nDespite that, Cohen provided some of the most damning testimony against Trump jurors heard.\n\nHe confirmed the 11 invoices he submitted to Trump, which underpin 11 of the charges the former president faces, were false records. He said that the $35,000 Trump paid him each month in 2017 was with \"minimal\" work for his then boss, undercutting defense arguments that those checks, from which another 11 Trump charges emerge, were a legal retainer.\n\nAnd, he spoke to the greater conspiracy of election influence that prosecutors aim to convince the jury took place, confirming he paid Daniels $130,000 for her silence and coordinated two other deals - at Trump's direction.\n\n\"There are things that you just have to take Michael Cohen's word for,\" Epner said of the state's case, though he noted extensive corroboration in many instances. \"The most important is Michael Cohen is the only person - our only source of direct evidence - that Donald Trump ever heard the particulars for how this reimbursement scheme was going to work.\n\n\"And if Donald Trump didn't hear that and agree to that, he's not guilty,\" he added.\n\nOver three days of cross-examination, defense attorneys ripped Cohen as a liar whose hush money deals were a rogue operation to which Trump was not privy. He admitted under cross-examination to stealing from the Trump Organization and to posting repeated condemnations of his ex-client online, including as the trial was ongoing.\n\nWith Cohen's credibility in dispute, the jury's perception of his testimony is a wild card - a risky position for prosecutors, whose case is significantly strengthened by the ex-fixer's assertions.\n\n\"A lot of this is going to be directly and indirectly on the shoulders of Michael Cohen,\" Saland said. \"(Jurors) are going to have to say, 'Well, you know what? I don't like Michael Cohen. He's a conniving, lying, disreputable, selfish, revenge-driven little man. But at the same time, I can understand where he's coming from.'\"\n\nBut defense attorneys may have their own credibility issues with which the jury must reckon.\n\nTheir primary witness was Robert Costello, a lawyer who once advised Cohen and acted as a go-between Trump's White House and his then-exiled fixer who was under federal investigation at the time.\n\nWhile Costello refuted Cohen's testimony that a \"pressure campaign\" was mounted against him, he groaned and groused at Judge Juan Merchan during his time on the stand - causing the judge to admonish Costello - and clear his courtroom.\n\nLegal experts agreed that jurors trust a judge more than anyone else in the courtroom.\n\n\"The jury is looking to the judge for keys and clues about what's credible and what's problematic,\" Levinson said. \"And when they see a witness having a kind of adult tantrum and then the judge clears the room - that's a really important message to them.\"\n\nOnce the jury receives the case, they could deliver a verdict at any time.\n\nIf the jury finds Trump guilty, he will become the first U.S. president convicted of a crime - and the first felon with a major political party's presumed nomination. If they acquit him, he will have accomplished another skirting of the law.\n\nSaland said it would be \"naive\" to think the magnitude of the jury's historic decision won't impact deliberations.\n\n\"Whether or not you think it's a foolish prosecution, a meritless prosecution or political prosecution - or born from absolute justice and a necessary prosecution - it doesn't matter,\" he said. \"Because if you're sitting in that jury room, no matter what you do or say, no matter what your outcome, it is going to have a ripple effect of magnitude potentially that we can't right now really contemplate.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File)\n\nThe testimony in Donald Trump's New York hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict.\n\nIt's impossible to say how long all of that will take, but in a landmark trial that's already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could easily be the most important.\n\nHere's what to expect in the days ahead:\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nStarting Tuesday morning, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments expected to last for much of the day, if not all of it.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election to a porn star who alleged she had a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nLook for prosecutors to remind jurors that they can trust the financial paperwork they've seen and the witnesses they've heard from. That includes porn actor Stormy Daniels, whose account of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump is at the heart of the case, and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme and authorized payments.\n\nIt's worth remembering that the defense, which called only two witnesses but not Trump, doesn't have to prove anything or convince jurors of Trump's innocence.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nExpect the defense to try to poke holes in the government's case by disputing Daniels' testimony about her hotel suite encounter with Trump and by distancing Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements to Cohen, who was responsible for the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels.\n\nThe defense may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid.\n\nAnd it'll certainly attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand. How much of his testimony the jury believes will go a long way in determining the outcome of the case.\n\nSince the prosecution has the burden of proof, it will deliver its summation last -- the reverse order from opening statements, in which the prosecution went first.\n\nONE LAST THING BEFORE THE JURY DELIBERATES\n\nA critical moment will take place, perhaps Wednesday morning, before the jury begins its deliberations.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nIn an indication of just how important those instructions are, prosecutors and defense lawyers had a spirited debate last week outside the jury's presence as they sought to persuade Merchan about the instructions he should give.\n\nThe Trump team, for instance, sought an instruction informing jurors that the types of hush money payments at issue in Trump's case are not inherently illegal, a request a prosecutor called \"totally inappropriate.\" Merchan said such an instruction would go too far and is unnecessary.\n\nTrump's team also asked Merchan to consider the \"extraordinarily important\" nature of the case when issuing his instructions and to urge jurors to reach \"very specific findings.\" Prosecutors objected to that as well, and Merchan agreed that it would be wrong to deviate from the standard instructions.\n\n\"When you say it's a very important case, you're asking me to change the law, and I'm not going to do that,\" Merchan said.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, requested an instruction that someone's status as a candidate doesn't need to be the sole motivation for making a payment that benefits the campaign. Defense lawyers asked for jurors to be told that if a payment would have been made even if the person wasn't running, it shouldn't be treated as a campaign contribution.\n\nONCE THE JURY GETS THE CASE\n\nThe deliberations will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that's intentionally opaque.\n\nJurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them.

Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial.\n\nOther cases\n\nAside from Daniels, the key prosecution witness was Michael Cohen, Trump's former \"fixer\" turned bitter foe who arranged the US$130,000 hush money payment.\n\nWalking jurors through the reasoning behind the payments, Cohen said they were made \"to ensure that the story would not come out, would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States.\"\n\nTrump's defence team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.\n\nThe defence called only two witnesses of their own before resting.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.\n\nNone of those trials are expected to take place before the November election. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Malay Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Paperwork Trial", "body": "The testimony is wrapped up in former President Donald Trump's paperwork New York trial after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations, and possibly a verdict.\n\nIt's impossible to say how long all of that will take, but in a landmark trial that's already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could easily be the most important.\n\nHere's what to expect in the days ahead:\n\nStarting Tuesday morning, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments expected to last for much of the day, if not all.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover-up payments during the 2016 presidential election to a porn star who alleged she had a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier. They will instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nLook for prosecutors to remind jurors that they can trust the financial paperwork they've seen and the witnesses they've heard from. That includes porn actor Stormy Daniels, whose account of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump is at the heart of the case, and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme and authorized payments.\n\nIt's worth remembering that the defense, which called only two witnesses but not Trump, doesn't have to prove anything or convince jurors of Trump's innocence.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nExpect the defense to try to poke holes in the government's case by disputing Daniels' testimony about her hotel suite encounter with Trump and by distancing Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements to Cohen, who was responsible for the $130,000 payment to Daniels.\n\nThe defense may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the that was paid.\n\nThe defense also certainly attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand. How much of his testimony the jury believes will go a long way in determining the outcome of the case.\n\nSince the prosecution has the burden of proof, it will deliver its summation last -- the reverse order from opening statements, in which the prosecution went first.\n\nA critical moment will take place, perhaps Wednesday morning, before the jury begins deliberations.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing guidance for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nIn an indication of just how important those instructions are, prosecutors and defense lawyers had a spirited debate last week outside the jury's presence as they sought to persuade Merchan about the instructions he should give.\n\nThe Trump team sought an instruction informing jurors that the types of alleged hush-money payments at issue in Trump's case are not inherently illegal, a request a prosecutor called \"totally inappropriate.\" Merchan said such an instruction would go too far and is unnecessary.\n\nTrump's team also asked Merchan to consider the \"extraordinarily important\" nature of the case when issuing his instructions and to urge jurors to reach \"very specific findings.\" Prosecutors objected to that as well, and Merchan agreed that it would be wrong to deviate from the standard instructions.\n\n\"When you say it's a very important case, you're asking me to change the law, and I'm not going to do that,\" Merchan said.\n\nProsecutors requested an instruction that someone's status as a candidate doesn't need to be the sole motivation for making a payment that benefits the campaign. Defense lawyers asked for jurors to be told that if a payment would have been made even if the person wasn't running, it shouldn't be treated as a campaign contribution.\n\nThe deliberations will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that's intentionally opaque.\n\nJurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for example, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it's hard to read too much into the meaning of any note.\n\nIt's anyone's guess how long the jury will deliberate for and there's no time limit, either. The jury must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records, so that could take some time, and a verdict might not come by the end of the week.\n\nTo reach a verdict, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it.\n\nThings will get trickier if the jury can't reach a consensus after several days of deliberations. Though defense lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial, Merchan is likely to call the jurors in and instruct them to keep trying for a verdict and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others.\n\nIf, after that instruction, the jury still can't reach a verdict, the judge would have the option to deem the panel hopelessly deadlocked and declare a mistrial.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deliberation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover-up", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cover-up"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burden of proof (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opening statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Tri-Ominos", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Tri-Ominos", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=6369699c-f9a5-4ada-a6e0-90a9f2c9e134&SiteName=Newsmax&maxsidesize=280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

For Dailymail.Com\n\nWill a former president be convicted by a jury of his 'peers' for the first time in history? It's only a matter of days until a verdict is reached in Donald Trump 's historic criminal hush money trial. Closing arguments will kick off Tuesday morning as the case comes to a close nearly six grueling weeks later.\n\nThe jury has heard bombshell testimony from Trump's former 'fixer' turned foe Michael Cohen, National Enquirer publisher David Pecker and [adult star] Stormy Daniels herself who graphically detailed her sexual experiences with the ex-president. Prosecutors have a high bar to reach in order to convince the 12-person New York jury that Trump conspired to help his 2016 election campaign by paying Stormy Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet about their alleged sexual encounters. DailyMail.com breaks down what to expect this week as the case comes to a close.\n\nTrump's defense will make its case first. The defense will deliver its closing arguments first on Tuesday - in the opposite order from the trial. Trump's attorney team is expected to lay out a strong defense of the former president, distancing him from Cohen's payments to Stormy Daniels. They will also reiterate several of their strongest points, that hush money payments are not illegal and Trump solely wanted to spare his family humiliation from Stormy's alleged affair claims.\n\nPerhaps the strongest strategy that will be employed by Trump's team is attacking the credibility of the prosecution's 'star witness' Michael Cohen. The defense only needs to convince one juror out of the 12 total that there isn't sufficient evidence 'beyond a reasonable doubt' to prove Trump is guilty to hand the ex-president a victory in the case.\n\nIf there is at least one holdout on convicting Trump, a 'hung jury' would be declared by the judge sparking a mistrial. 'He's cloaked in innocence,' Trump attorney Todd Blanche previously insisted about the ex-president during opening statements. 'And that cloak of innocence does not leave President Trump today. It doesn't leave him at any day during this trial. And it won't leave him when you all deliberate. You will find that he is not guilty.'\n\nThe prosecution will run through evidence and testimony again. The prosecution will follow the defense during arguments, which are expected to go on for several hours. Bragg's team is expected to run through all the evidence they presented during the 19 days they made their case. That includes 11 checks, 11 invoices and 12 vouches that prosecutors say are proof of how Trump 'falsified' records to reimburse Cohen for the Stormy Daniels payments. They will also have to push back on the defense's argument that Cohen is a 'liar' who cannot be trusted.\n\nLast week, Judge Juan Merchan (pictured) warned that closing arguments could bleed into a second day. 'In a case like this, which is a rather long case, summations will not be quick,' he stated. The court is usually off on Wednesdays, but the judge has indicated that proceedings will continue then so as not to further drag out deliberations.\n\nJury will be instructed by the judge on how to deliberate. Once the closing arguments are complete, the jury will be instructed by Merchan for about an hour on how to deliberate behind closed doors. Last week, Merchan considered the instructions that will be read to the 12 jury members who will decide Trump's fate during a 'charging conference.' In a win for Trump, the judge said that he would tell the panel to treat Trump fairly during their deliberations.\n\nThe instruction was outside of the normal language used to charge the jury in a concession to the defense. The wording plays a key part in how the jury deliberate and experts believe it can win or lose a case. Over more than an hour, Trump's lawyers and attorneys from the Manhattan District Attorney's office sparred over the minutiae of the text, in some cases down to single words.\n\nJury deliberations kick off and a verdict will be reached. Once jurors are dismissed by the judge to work on coming to an agreement in the case, which is expected Wednesday, they could be huddled for days. If they have questions, they could come back and ask the judge for an explanation or to read back certain points of the testimony. Judicial experts say that the longer the jury deliberates, the better it is for Trump. The outcome of the case could be resolved in one of three manners : an acquittal, a conviction or a mistrial. If Trump is convicted, his team will likely start the appeals process, which could take years. It is unlikely that Trump, if found guilty, would be sentenced before the 2024 election in November.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

They will lay out the case that Trump falsified business records to keep the hush money payment secret amid fear that the episode could sink his already rocky outsider's bid to defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe 12 jurors -- whose identities have been kept secret for their protection -- will then start deliberations as early as Wednesday, with a guilty verdict potentially triggering a prison sentence.\n\nComing less than six months before the November presidential election, in which polls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden, the verdict will mark a new moment of extreme tension in an already unprecedented contest.\n\nTrump, 77, is already the first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, with charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations that he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election in which he lost to Biden.\n\nThe New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks, is the only one likely to have been completed, or even come to trial, by November 5 election day.\n\nIf convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.\n\nTrump would almost certainly appeal and a conviction would not in any case bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.\n\nAs expected, Trump chose not to testify in his defense -- a move that would have exposed him to damaging cross-examination.\n\nInstead, he was forced to sit and listen while Daniels recounted their alleged encounter in sometimes graphic detail and his once close personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen took the stand as star prosecution witness.\n\nHowever, Trump has used his daily trips to the court in lower Manhattan to stage televised tirades against \"corrupt\" and \"tyrant\" Judge Juan Merchan, and to claim that the trial is a Democratic ploy to keep him off the election campaign trail. Polls do not show the trial having any impact on his strong support from right-wing voters.\n\nRepublican Trump loyalists, including several vying to be picked as his vice president on the November ticket, have become outspoken critics of the trial and in some cases have made the trek to the courtroom to sit behind him.\n\n- Unanimity required -\n\nThe judge has said he expects closing arguments to take up all of Tuesday. He will then give final instructions to the jury on how to interpret the law.\n\nTo return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires unanimity. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial, although prosecutors could then seek a new trial.\n\nAside from Daniels, the key prosecution witness was Cohen, who testified that he had arranged the $130,000 hush money payment so her story \"would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States.\"\n\nTrump's defense team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of storing huge quantities of classified national security documents after leaving the White House.\n\nbur-sms/bfm\n\nMore from this section\n\nAt least 22 dead in Memorial Day weekend storms that devastated several US states\n\nBill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71\n\nClosing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict?

After more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments Tuesday.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they won't be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence -- and there were many. Judge Juan M. Merchan, for instance, fined Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases Trump is confronting as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nWhere each Trump case stands Classified documents case Election interference Hush money scheme Georgia election indictment Arizona election indictment Civil cases\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Each side will weave together five weeks of evidence and testimony to make a case for the first-ever conviction or acquittal of a former U.S. president.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in order to conceal or commit another crime. Prosecutors argue Trump falsified records tied to reimbursing his then-lawyer, Michael Cohen, for an unlawful $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nClosing arguments can be crucial for helping jurors understand whether the testimony and evidence they have heard adds up to a compelling case.\n\nFinally, jurors will hear the judges' instructions on the law they should apply in the case.\n\nTo win a conviction, prosecutors have to prove not only that Trump falsified business records, but also that his motivation was to hide the violation of federal campaign finance laws in 2016 or hide a plan to violate New York tax or election laws. The alleged campaign finance violation was the $130,000 hush money, which prosecutors say was a campaign contribution that exceeded the $2,700 legal limit. Cohen pleaded guilty to that federal crime in 2018.\n\nThese are the key questions the closing arguments will address and jurors will be asked to decide:\n\nIs Trump responsible for falsifying records tied to hush money?\n\nThe 34 allegedly falsified records in the case are checks, vouchers, and invoices tied to a series of $35,000 payments to Cohen in 2017. Prosecutors say the payments were mischaracterized as 2017 legal expenses under a non-existent agreement to retain Cohen's services. The payments were actually reimbursing Cohen for the hush money and another expense, as well as giving him an extra bonus.\n\nMichael Cohen was a star prosecution witness for a reason: he had more to say than anyone else in the trial about Trump's alleged participation in both paying the hush money and covering it up. Cohen testified that Trump approved the falsified reimbursement scheme during a meeting with Cohen and then-Trump Organization executive Allen Weisselberg in early 2017. Cohen also testified that Trump authorized the hush money to Daniels - saying \"Just do it\" - in October of 2016.\n\nProsecutors are likely to point to evidence from trial that bolsters Cohen's testimony, such as Trump's own signature - according to testimony from multiple witnesses who worked with him - on many of the checks to Cohen.\n\nProsecutors will probably also point to statements by Trump that suggest he would be paying attention to invoices from Cohen and to what his own checks were for. For instance, a book publisher read aloud these statements from Trump's 2005 book, \"Trump: Think Like a Billionaire\":\n\nProsecutors are also likely to remind jurors of notes they saw that former Trump Organization executive Jeffrey McConney said were drafted by Weisselberg and outlined the calculation of payments to Cohen, including doubling the $130,000 hush money payment to account for taxes.\n\nAnd prosecutors may try to bolster the notion that Trump was kept abreast of the Stormy Daniels hush money deal by pointing to an audio recording from the trial that allegedly involves Cohen and Trump talking about an earlier $150,000 hush money deal to quiet former Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nIn the somewhat cryptic conversation, Cohen references \"our friend David\" and \"financing,\" while Trump appears to ask about paying \"150\" and instructs not to pay with cash. Cohen testified he made the recording to reassure tabloid publisher David Pecker that Trump planned to re-pay him for the hush money.\n\nWhat will Trump's defense tell jurors about records?\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche gave a preview last week of what his team may argue to jurors. Blanche urged Judge Juan Merchan to toss out the entire case, saying the business records \"were not false\" because Cohen agreed he supplied Trump with legal services in 2017.\n\nTrump's team is also likely to tell jurors that Michael Cohen is a liar - so they can't trust his testimony that the payments were actually reimbursing hush money, not paying for ongoing legal services. They may remind jurors that Cohen previously pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and making false statements to a bank.\n\nRobert Costello - one of just two witnesses the defense called in the trial - may be a key focus in challenging Cohen's testimony. Costello quoted Cohen as having said: \"I swear to God, Bob, I don't have anything on Donald Trump.\" Meanwhile, Cohen said Costello was trying to create a back channel of communication to Trump, and he didn't trust the \"sketchy\" lawyer.\n\nWas this an attempt to hide unlawful election interference?\n\nProsecutors need to prove not just that Trump falsified business records, but also that he was trying to commit or conceal another crime. Their leading argument throughout the trial has been that Trump was trying to hide unlawfully interfering in the 2016 election. \"It was election fraud, pure and simple,\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told jurors in his opening statement.\n\nThat argument turns on whether the hush money payment to Daniels violated federal campaign finance laws. A key issue in answering that question will be whether the hush money was about the campaign, as opposed to protecting Trump's marriage or family life.\n\nIn fact, former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards escaped conviction in his own criminal case on campaign finance charges by arguing that nearly $1 million from donors that was used to conceal an affair and illegitimate child during his campaign was aimed at shielding his actions from his cancer-stricken wife.\n\nThe prosecution in Trump's case may point to a series of statements from witnesses at trial to make their case:\n\nWhat will the Trump defense team say?\n\nTrump's defense team appears poised to argue Trump didn't know about the hush money payment ahead of time. In his cross-examination of Cohen, Blanche displayed text messages suggesting a call from Cohen to Trump's bodyguard was to talk about harassment from a 14-year-old, not to get Trump on the phone about the Daniels hush money deal. Cohen said he believed he also discussed the deal with Trump.\n\nIn addition, the defense team could say there's no clear evidence the hush money payment was focused on the election. Hope Hicks testified that Trump was \"concerned\" about how a November, 2016 story on the hush money deal involving McDougal would be viewed by Melania Trump, and wanted Hicks to make sure newspapers weren't delivered to the Trump residence that morning.\n\nAnother former Trump White House aide, Madeleine Westerhout, also testified to admiring Trump's relationship with his wife, although she also said she didn't observe any change in the relationship after the Wall Street Journal reported on the Stormy Daniels hush money deal broke in 2018.\n\nWas this an attempt to hide a plan to violate state election and tax laws?\n\nProsecutors are likely to also argue there are alternative options for convicting Trump, even if jurors don't find that he falsified records in order to cover up the violation of federal campaign finance laws.\n\nIn pre-trial filings, prosecutors said Trump was also planning on violating a New York election law by using \"unlawful means\" to promote Trump's presidential election. And they said he was planning on committing tax fraud by doubling the reimbursement to Cohen to account for taxes.\n\nThe Trump team, on the other hand, will likely say the business records weren't covering up any crime.\n\n\"There is simply no evidence that there is any effort to conceal anything by - not only by President Trump, but also by any of the others involved,\" Blanche already told Merchan in his unsuccessful attempt to get the case tossed out.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

After more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments Tuesday.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they won't be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence -- and there were many. Judge Juan M. Merchan, for instance, fined Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases Trump is confronting as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nWhere each Trump case stands Classified documents case Election interference Hush money scheme Georgia election indictment Civil cases Arizona election indictment\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

They'll instead function as hours-long recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nLook for prosecutors to remind jurors that they can trust the financial paperwork they've seen and the witnesses they've heard from. That includes porn actor Stormy Daniels, whose account of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump is at the heart of the case, and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme and authorized payments.\n\nIt's worth remembering that the defence, which called only two witnesses but not Trump, doesn't have to prove anything or convince jurors of Trump's innocence.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defence simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nExpect the defence to try to poke holes in the government's case by disputing Daniels' testimony about her hotel suite encounter with Trump and by distancing Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements to Cohen, who was responsible for the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels.\n\nThe defence may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid.\n\nAnd it'll certainly attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand. How much of his testimony the jury believes will go a long way in determining the outcome of the case.\n\nSince the prosecution has the burden of proof, it will deliver its summation last - the reverse order from opening statements, in which the prosecution went first.\n\nA critical moment will take place, perhaps Wednesday morning, before the jury begins its deliberations.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a road map for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nIn an indication of just how important those instructions are, prosecutors and defence lawyers had a spirited debate last week outside the jury's presence as they sought to persuade Merchan about the instructions he should give.\n\nThe Trump team, for instance, sought an instruction informing jurors that the types of hush money payments at issue in Trump's case are not inherently illegal, a request a prosecutor called \"totally inappropriate.\" Merchan said such an instruction would go too far and is unnecessary.\n\nTrump's team also asked Merchan to consider the \"extraordinarily important\" nature of the case when issuing his instructions and to urge jurors to reach \"very specific findings.\" Prosecutors objected to that as well, and Merchan agreed that it would be wrong to deviate from the standard instructions.\n\n\"When you say it's a very important case, you're asking me to change the law, and I'm not going to do that,\" Merchan said.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, requested an instruction that someone's status as a candidate doesn't need to be the sole motivation for making a payment that benefits the campaign. Defense lawyers asked for jurors to be told that if a payment would have been made even if the person wasn't running, it shouldn't be treated as a campaign contribution.\n\nThe deliberations will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that's intentionally opaque.\n\nJurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it's hard to read too much into the meaning of any note.\n\nIt's anyone's guess how long the jury will deliberate for and there's no time limit either. The jury must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records, so that could take some time, and a verdict might not come by the end of the week.\n\nTo reach a verdict, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it.\n\nThings will get trickier if the jury can't reach a consensus after several days of deliberations. Though defence lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial, Merchan is likely to call the jurors in and instruct them to keep trying for a verdict and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others.\n\nIf, after that instruction, the jury still can't reach a verdict, the judge would have the option to deem the panel hopelessly deadlocked and declare a mistrial.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burden of proof (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opening statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Defense_Ministries", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Defense Ministries", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Tri-Ominos", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Tri-Ominos", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/NYJNT37S2ZGN7FCHEYENQZISYU.jpg?auth=ff1b8ff5c056b59fba2b0117ade13df4ccb100ffe1b19e8171df476f2dd9af22&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

$130,000 hush money payment.\n\nWalking jurors through the reasoning behind the payments, Cohen said they were made \"to ensure that the story would not come out, would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump's defense team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.\n\nThe defense called only two witnesses of their own before resting.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White

Here's What to Expect From Its Final Days.", "body": "Every week for the past several months, I've been writing about Donald Trump's legal troubles, and I've gotten to see, time and time again, how he has fought tooth and nail to delay and derail his criminal hush money case. Last week, I finally got to see Trump in the flesh as he strode into the Manhattan courtroom, a scowl on his face, frowning at just about every person there, including the 12 jurors who are about to decide his fate.\n\nTrump sat sandwiched between his attorneys and flanked by his son Don Jr. and adviser Boris Epshteyn. As his defense team rested its case, each member of the jury sat upright and watched the day's proceedings intently. Closing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday, and the jury is expected to begin its deliberations the following day. Its members have a lot to consider.\n\nOver the past six weeks, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has presented his case for why Trump should be convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, bringing in witnesses who described how badly Trump wanted to protect his image ahead of the 2016 election: David Pecker, the former CEO of American Media Inc., and Michael Cohen, Trump's former attorney and personal fixer. Pecker confirmed he used his tabloid empire to kill negative stories about Trump, while Cohen, the prosecution's star witness, testified that Trump instructed him to pay off porn actor Stormy Daniels weeks before the 2016 election to protect his presidential campaign and prevent Daniels from going public about her affair with Trump.\n\nIn order to find Trump guilty of felony record-keeping fraud, the jury must unanimously agree that the prosecution has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Trump falsified records when making payments to Cohen and that he did so with the intent to conceal another crime, like the violation of election laws. Trump's attorneys have argued that the payments to Cohen were simply legal fees, while the prosecutors have spent the entire trial trying to prove they were actually reimbursements for the payment Cohen made to Daniels to preserve Trump's standing with the voting public before Election Day. Even one deflection will lead to a hung jury -- meaning no verdict is reached and Trump is neither convicted nor acquitted.\n\n\"If they're responsible jurors, they're going to take some time, regardless of whether they have strong feelings about the case, to go through the instructions and walk through what the different witnesses proved in their minds and debate with each other,\" Rebecca Lonergan, a professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law and a former federal prosecutor, told Slate.\n\nLonergan expects jury members to take at least a few days, if not a couple of weeks, to come to a decision. And if they ask New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan for readbacks -- transcripts of trial testimony to refresh their memory about what certain witnesses said on the stand -- that will only add time to the deliberation process.\n\nA major factor in the jury's deliberations will be how reliable the group believes Cohen to be. He has been convicted of lying to Congress once before -- even serving prison time -- and has admitted to having a vendetta against Trump. However, during the hush money trial, he has maintained to the jury that he told his past lies \"in order to protect\" his former boss.\n\nCurrently, the jury is being asked to decide whether to convict Trump on felony charges alone. However, Merchan could introduce \"lesser included offenses,\" allowing the jury to convict Trump on misdemeanor charges instead. This would require the defense to waive its statute of limitations, since misdemeanor charges can be pursued only within a two-year window of the crime, according to New York law. However, if Trump's attorneys want to limit a more damaging verdict, it might be in their favor to offer the jury lesser charges to consider.\n\n\"A misdemeanor charge just requires proof that the former president intentionally falsified business records, but to convict on a felony, the jury would have to believe that the former president did so with the intent to conceal another crime,\" Lauren-Brooke Eisen, senior director at the Brennan Center's Justice Program, explained to Slate.\n\nIt's not yet clear whether misdemeanor charges will be thrown into the mix. Nonetheless, the type of white-collar felony that Trump faces typically brings a prison sentence of one to four years. All the experts Slate spoke to believe that Trump won't actually spend time behind bars. \"First-time offender in New York City? Zero prison time,\" said Adam Pollock, a former New York assistant attorney general. He thinks Trump, if convicted, will likely have to serve just probation, since his case deals with a nonviolent crime and a relatively small amount of money -- Daniels was paid $130,000 in her hush money deal.\n\nProbation allows a defendant to remain out of prison with some restrictions on their liberty. In Trump's case, the exact terms of his probation would be determined by Merchan, and they could include having to wear an ankle monitor, attending regular check-ins with an assigned probation officer, and completing community service. He might also be required to get permission anytime he travels, and his probation officer would have the legal right to make unannounced visits to his home.\n\nIf the jury cannot come to a unanimous decision, then Merchan would be forced to declare a mistrial, and though not acquitted of the charges, Trump would be free to walk. Bragg would need to decide whether he wants to retry Trump all over again. An important piece of that calculus will be finding out why the jury couldn't reach a verdict. \"Was it one holdout? Were there lots of jurors who didn't think there could be a conviction?\" said Eisen. \"Was there an extended deliberation? There will be a lot of things that the office will want to consider before retrying.\"\n\nAnd if the jury finds Trump guilty, he will most likely appeal the verdict. Similar to Trump's civil fraud case, he would need to pay a bond while the appeal plays out, which would take months, at a minimum.", "source": {"uri": "slate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slate

Trump denies wrongdoing and says he never had sex with Daniels.\n\nProsecutors have the burden of proving Trump is guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" the level of certainty required by U.S. law. They will make their presentation after the defense, as is standard in New York criminal trials.\n\n\"Why can't the defense go last? Big advantage, very unfair,\" Trump said on social media early on Tuesday.\n\nOver the course of the trial, Trump's lawyers have tried to raise doubts about the credibility of prosecution witnesses, most notably Michael Cohen, who testified that as Trump's fixer he handled the payment to Daniels and that Trump approved the cover-up.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Trump's lawyers got Cohen to discuss his felony convictions and imprisonment, his history of lying and his lingering animosity for his former boss. Cohen also admitted to stealing from Trump's company.\n\nIf found guilty, Trump faces up to four years in prison, although imprisonment is unlikely for a first-time felon convicted of such a crime.\n\nA conviction will not prevent Trump from trying to take back the White House from Democratic President Joe Biden as the Republican candidate in the Nov. 5 election, and it would not prevent him from taking office if he won. Opinion polls show the two candidates locked in a tight race.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, normally a misdemeanor under New York law.\n\nProsecutors in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office elevated those charges to felonies, saying Trump falsified those records to disguise what amounted to an illegal campaign contribution: the payment that bought Daniels' silence about the alleged 2006 sexual encounter at a time when Trump was already facing multiple accusations of sexual misconduct.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing. His lawyers have implied that the $130,000 payment for Daniels' silence was intended to spare Trump's family from embarrassment, not to protect his White House bid. Prosecutors will cite testimony to argue otherwise.\n\nTrump faces three other criminal prosecutions as well, but none is likely to go to trial before the election.\n\nSeparate cases in Washington and Georgia accuse him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat, while another case in Florida charges him with mishandling classified information after he left office in 2021.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases and says they are an effort by Biden's Democratic allies to hobble his presidential bid.

Major Week Looms in Trump Hush Money Trial | LatestLY", "body": "Washington, May 28 (AP) The testimony in Donald Trump's New York hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict.\n\nIt's impossible to say how long all of that will take, but in a landmark trial that's already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could easily be the most important.\n\nAlso Read | Israel-Palestine Conflict: Amid Growing International Condemnation, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu Calls Civilian Deaths in Rafah 'Tragic Mishap'.\n\nHere's what to expect in the days ahead:\n\nAlso Read | North Korea's Second Spy Satellite Launch Fails, Rocket Explodes Shortly After Liftoff (Watch Video).\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nStarting Tuesday morning, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments expected to last for much of the day, if not all of it.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election to a porn star who alleged she had a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier.\n\nThey'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nLook for prosecutors to remind jurors that they can trust the financial paperwork they've seen and the witnesses they've heard from. That includes porn actor Stormy Daniels, whose account of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump is at the heart of the case, and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme and authorized payments.\n\nIt's worth remembering that the defense, which called only two witnesses but not Trump, doesn't have to prove anything or convince jurors of Trump's innocence.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nExpect the defense to try to poke holes in the government's case by disputing Daniels' testimony about her hotel suite encounter with Trump and by distancing Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements to Cohen, who was responsible for the USD 1,30,000 hush money payment to Daniels.\n\nThe defense may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid.\n\nAnd it'll certainly attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand. How much of his testimony the jury believes will go a long way in determining the outcome of the case.\n\nSince the prosecution has the burden of proof, it will deliver its summation last -- the reverse order from opening statements, in which the prosecution went first.\n\nONE LAST THING BEFORE THE JURY DELIBERATES\n\nA critical moment will take place, perhaps Wednesday morning, before the jury begins its deliberations.\n\nJudge Juan M Merchan is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nIn an indication of just how important those instructions are, prosecutors and defense lawyers had a spirited debate last week outside the jury's presence as they sought to persuade Merchan about the instructions he should give.\n\nThe Trump team, for instance, sought an instruction informing jurors that the types of hush money payments at issue in Trump's case are not inherently illegal, a request a prosecutor called \"totally inappropriate.\" Merchan said such an instruction would go too far and is unnecessary.\n\nTrump's team also asked Merchan to consider the \"extraordinarily important\" nature of the case when issuing his instructions and to urge jurors to reach \"very specific findings.\"\n\nProsecutors objected to that as well, and Merchan agreed that it would be wrong to deviate from the standard instructions.\n\n\"When you say it's a very important case, you're asking me to change the law, and I'm not going to do that,\" Merchan said.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, requested an instruction that someone's status as a candidate doesn't need to be the sole motivation for making a payment that benefits the campaign. Defense lawyers asked for jurors to be told that if a payment would have been made even if the person wasn't running, it shouldn't be treated as a campaign contribution.\n\nONCE THE JURY GETS THE CASE\n\nThe deliberations will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that's intentionally opaque.\n\nJurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it's hard to read too much into the meaning of any note.\n\nIt's anyone's guess how long the jury will deliberate for and there's no time limit either. The jury must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records, so that could take some time, and a verdict might not come by the end of the week.\n\nTo reach a verdict on any given count, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it.\n\nThings will get trickier if the jury can't reach a consensus after several days of deliberations. Though defense lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial, Merchan is likely to call the jurors in and instruct them to keep trying for a verdict and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others.\n\nIf, after that instruction, the jury still can't reach a verdict, the judge would have the option to deem the panel hopelessly deadlocked and declare a mistrial.

After more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nSt. Louis alt-weekly Riverfront Times sold, lays off all staff Sisters, 8 and 10, who died in wreck on I-270 were best friends, family says The end of Riverfront Times brings shock, sense of loss.

Paul Goldschmidt launches two homers as Cardinals reign over Cubs in sweep\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys will aim to create doubts about the strength of evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and who served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\nAfter the closing arguments are given, the judge will instruct the jury, likely Wednesday, on the law governing the case and the factors it can take into account during deliberations. The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments Tuesday.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they won't be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence -- and there were many. Judge Juan M. Merchan, for instance, fined Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases Trump is confronting as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial.\n\nAside from Daniels, the key prosecution witness was Michael Cohen, Trump's former \"fixer\" turned bitter foe who said he arranged the $130,000 hush money payment so her story \"would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States.\"\n\nTrump's defense team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.\n\nNone of those trials are expected to take place before the November election.", "source": {"uri": "thejournal.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheJournal.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@thejournal.ie", "name": "Agence

Trump denies wrongdoing and says he never had sex with Daniels.\n\nProsecutors have the burden of proving Trump is guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" the level of certainty required by U.S. law. They will make their presentation after the defense, as is standard in New York criminal trials.\n\n\"Why can't the defense go last? Big advantage, very unfair,\" Trump said on social media early on Tuesday.\n\nOver the course of the trial, Trump's lawyers have tried to raise doubts about the credibility of prosecution witnesses, most notably Michael Cohen, who testified that as Trump's fixer he handled the payment to Daniels and that Trump approved the cover-up.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Trump's lawyers got Cohen to discuss his felony convictions and imprisonment, his history of lying and his lingering animosity for his former boss. Cohen also admitted to stealing from Trump's company.\n\nIf found guilty, Trump faces up to four years in prison, although imprisonment is unlikely for a first-time felon convicted of such a crime.\n\nA conviction will not prevent Trump from trying to take back the White House from Democratic President Joe Biden as the Republican candidate in the Nov. 5 election, and it would not prevent him from taking office if he won. Opinion polls show the two candidates locked in a tight race.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, normally a misdemeanor under New York law.\n\nProsecutors in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office elevated those charges to felonies, saying Trump falsified those records to disguise what amounted to an illegal campaign contribution: the payment that bought Daniels' silence about the alleged 2006 sexual encounter at a time when Trump was already facing multiple accusations of sexual misconduct.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing. His lawyers have implied that the $130,000 payment for Daniels' silence was intended to spare Trump's family from embarrassment, not to protect his White House bid. Prosecutors will cite testimony to argue otherwise.\n\nTrump faces three other criminal prosecutions as well, but none is likely to go to trial before the election.\n\nSeparate cases in Washington and Georgia accuse him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat, while another case in Florida charges him with mishandling classified information after he left office in 2021.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases and says they are an effort by Biden's Democratic allies to hobble his presidential bid.

Each side will weave together five weeks of evidence and testimony to make a case for the first-ever conviction or acquittal of a former U.S. president.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in order to conceal or commit another crime. Prosecutors argue Trump falsified records tied to reimbursing his then-lawyer, Michael Cohen, for an unlawful $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nClosing arguments can be crucial for helping jurors understand whether the testimony and evidence they have heard adds up to a compelling case.\n\nFinally, jurors will hear the judges' instructions on the law they should apply in the case.\n\nTo win a conviction, prosecutors have to prove not only that Trump falsified business records, but also that his motivation was to hide the violation of federal campaign finance laws in 2016 or hide a plan to violate New York tax or election laws. The alleged campaign finance violation was the $130,000 hush money, which prosecutors say was a campaign contribution that exceeded the $2,700 legal limit. Cohen pleaded guilty to that federal crime in 2018.\n\nThese are the key questions the closing arguments will address and jurors will be asked to decide:\n\nThe 34 allegedly falsified records in the case are checks, vouchers, and invoices tied to a series of $35,000 payments to Cohen in 2017. Prosecutors say the payments were mischaracterized as 2017 legal expenses under a non-existent agreement to retain Cohen's services. The payments were actually reimbursing Cohen for the hush money and another expense, as well as giving him an extra bonus.\n\nMichael Cohen was a star prosecution witness for a reason: he had more to say than anyone else in the trial about Trump's alleged participation in both paying the hush money and covering it up. Cohen testified that Trump approved the falsified reimbursement scheme during a meeting with Cohen and then-Trump Organization executive Allen Weisselberg in early 2017. Cohen also testified that Trump authorized the hush money to Daniels - saying \"Just do it\" - in October of 2016.\n\nProsecutors are likely to point to evidence from trial that bolsters Cohen's testimony, such as Trump's own signature - according to testimony from multiple witnesses who worked with him - on many of the checks to Cohen.\n\nProsecutors will probably also point to statements by Trump that suggest he would be paying attention to invoices from Cohen and to what his own checks were for. For instance, a book publisher read aloud these statements from Trump's 2005 book, \"Trump: Think Like a Billionaire\":\n\nProsecutors are also likely to remind jurors of notes they saw that former Trump Organization executive Jeffrey McConney said were drafted by Weisselberg and outlined the calculation of payments to Cohen, including doubling the $130,000 hush money payment to account for taxes.\n\nAnd prosecutors may try to bolster the notion that Trump was kept abreast of the Stormy Daniels hush money deal by pointing to an audio recording from the trial that allegedly involves Cohen and Trump talking about an earlier $150,000 hush money deal to quiet former Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nIn the somewhat cryptic conversation, Cohen references \"our friend David\" and \"financing,\" while Trump appears to ask about paying \"150\" and instructs not to pay with cash. Cohen testified he made the recording to reassure tabloid publisher David Pecker that Trump planned to re-pay him for the hush money.\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche gave a preview last week of what his team may argue to jurors. Blanche urged Judge Juan Merchan to toss out the entire case, saying the business records \"were not false\" because Cohen agreed he supplied Trump with legal services in 2017.\n\nTrump's team is also likely to tell jurors that Michael Cohen is a liar - so they can't trust his testimony that the payments were actually reimbursing hush money, not paying for ongoing legal services. They may remind jurors that Cohen previously pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and making false statements to a bank.\n\nRobert Costello - one of just two witnesses the defense called in the trial - may be a key focus in challenging Cohen's testimony. Costello quoted Cohen as having said: \"I swear to God, Bob, I don't have anything on Donald Trump.\" Meanwhile, Cohen said Costello was trying to create a back channel of communication to Trump, and he didn't trust the \"sketchy\" lawyer.\n\nProsecutors need to prove not just that Trump falsified business records, but also that he was trying to commit or conceal another crime. Their leading argument throughout the trial has been that Trump was trying to hide unlawfully interfering in the 2016 election. \"It was election fraud, pure and simple,\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told jurors in his opening statement.\n\nThat argument turns on whether the hush money payment to Daniels violated federal campaign finance laws. A key issue in answering that question will be whether the hush money was about the campaign, as opposed to protecting Trump's marriage or family life.\n\nIn fact, former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards escaped conviction in his own criminal case on campaign finance charges by arguing that nearly $1 million from donors that was used to conceal an affair and illegitimate child during his campaign was aimed at shielding his actions from his cancer-stricken wife.\n\nThe prosecution in Trump's case may point to a series of statements from witnesses at trial to make their case:\n\nKinsey Crowley \u00b7 F17 - E\n\nTrump's defense team appears poised to argue Trump didn't know about the hush money payment ahead of time. In his cross-examination of Cohen, Blanche displayed text messages suggesting a call from Cohen to Trump's bodyguard was to talk about harassment from a 14-year-old, not to get Trump on the phone about the Daniels hush money deal. Cohen said he believed he also discussed the deal with Trump.\n\nIn addition, the defense team could say there's no clear evidence the hush money payment was focused on the election. Hope Hicks testified that Trump was \"concerned\" about how a November, 2016 story on the hush money deal involving McDougal would be viewed by Melania Trump, and wanted Hicks to make sure newspapers weren't delivered to the Trump residence that morning.\n\nAnother former Trump White House aide, Madeleine Westerhout, also testified to admiring Trump's relationship with his wife, although she also said she didn't observe any change in the relationship after the Wall Street Journal reported on the Stormy Daniels hush money deal broke in 2018.\n\nProsecutors are likely to also argue there are alternative options for convicting Trump, even if jurors don't find that he falsified records in order to cover up the violation of federal campaign finance laws.\n\nIn pre-trial filings, prosecutors said Trump was also planning on violating a New York election law by using \"unlawful means\" to promote Trump's presidential election. And they said he was planning on committing tax fraud by doubling the reimbursement to Cohen to account for taxes.\n\nThe Trump team, on the other hand, will likely say the business records weren't covering up any crime.\n\n\"There is simply no evidence that there is any effort to conceal anything by - not only by President Trump, but also by any of the others involved,\" Blanche already told Merchan in his unsuccessful attempt to get the case tossed out.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Here's what to know", "body": "(CNN) -- When prosecutors make their final pitch Tuesday to New York jurors for why they should convict former President Donald Trump of a slew of business crimes, they'll face the burdensome task of weaving together weeks of testimony and evidence they say proves Trump committed felonies to help his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThe closing arguments in Trump's historic hush money criminal case will give prosecutors from District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office an opportunity to explain to the 12 jurors how each witness they called and piece of evidence they presented bolsters their case for a guilty verdict on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nThat was already going to be a complicated task for a trial that's been underway since mid-April and frequently featured witnesses going over the dry details of business recordkeeping and other mundane testimony. But prosecutors will have an extra degree of difficulty with a long break ahead of closing arguments, as jurors will have been away from the case since Tuesday.\n\n\"There's plenty of moments during trial where you're getting a piece of testimony or you're introducing a document or other exhibit, and the jury is thinking, 'Well, how does this fit in?' That's unavoidable. It's your job at closing to weave it all together, and to make it make sense. And so that will be especially the case here because this is a long trial,\" said CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor.\n\n\"This, more than even your typical case, is going to be a closing case,\" he added.\n\nFormer New York prosecutor Bernarda Villalona said prosecutors will use their closing arguments \"to tell the story from the very beginning.\" She said that unlike their opening statement, which lasted about 40 minutes, prosecutors' final remarks in the case could go on for several hours and feature a visual aid like a PowerPoint presentation to help walk the jury back through some of the key evidence.\n\n\"The boring is over. The boring part was having them sit down to hear it,\" added Villalona, referring to the 12 jurors. \"Interestingly enough, the boring part is actually the most important part of the case because the boring part is what gives you the documents. The star witness in this case are the documents, and the documents speak for themselves.\"\n\nTrump's attorneys will present their closing arguments first on Tuesday, followed by the arguments from prosecutors. Trump's legal team is expected to focus on the credibility of former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, the only prosecution witness to directly tie the former president to the coverup payments, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche will argue that there was no crime and that business documents were not falsified since Cohen was Trump's attorney and continued to work for him into 2017, the people said.\n\nOnce both sides finish their arguments, Judge Juan Merchan will instruct the jury as to the charges it must consider against the former president; then, the jurors will begin their deliberations. The judge has said he expects this to happen on Wednesday.\n\nThe closing arguments will begin exactly a week after the defense rested its case on Tuesday and more than five weeks after opening statements were delivered and the first witness, former tabloid executive David Pecker, took the stand.\n\nThe prosecution called 20 witnesses over 19 days in court, with their testimony totaling over 50 hours. Many of their witnesses were not household names, though some, including Cohen and adult film actress Stormy Daniels -- whose alleged affair with Trump is at the center of the case -- were high-profile figures whose testimony is no doubt seared into jurors' minds. (Trump has denied the alleged affair.)\n\nFor its part, Trump's team called just two witnesses: a paralegal who entered phone records into evidence and Robert Costello, an attorney who was in talks with Cohen to represent him in 2018.\n\nTrump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree to cover up the reimbursement of hush money payments made before the 2016 election to Daniels. If convicted, Merchan could sentence Trump to probation or a sentence of 1 1/3 to 4 years on each count in state prison, with a maximum of 20 years.\n\nBlanche is expected to highlight that prosecutors didn't call former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg, who is the only other person in the Trump Tower meeting in 2017 where Cohen said Trump approved the reimbursement plan and monthly check payments; Dylan Howard, a former top editor of the National Enquirer who was involved in all three of the \"catch and kill\" deals; nor Keith Schiller, a former bodyguard to Trump, the people said.\n\nWhat prosecutors might argue\n\nProsecutors will likely contend during their closing arguments that each of their witnesses plays a key role in the case, despite their professional rank or proximity to the alleged crimes. They will probably also have to push back against claims by the defense that Cohen, prosecutors' star witness, undermines their case because of his history of dishonesty, Honig said.\n\n\"The prosecution's argument will be that all the evidence interlocks and is corroborated and that you don't have to rely on any one witness's word on its own. They will say this is a documents case,\" he explained, going on to describe the various accounting documents presented during the trial.\n\n\"And they'll say, 'Michael Cohen's here to guide you through it, but you don't need to believe him -- everything he says is backed up'\" by evidence and other testimony, Honig said.\n\nJoshua Steinglass, who is doing closings for the prosecution, is expected to address the jury for several hours following the defense's presentation. He is expected to tie together text messages, phone logs, other witnesses' testimony and the 34 allegedly falsified documents to corroborate Cohen's testimony.\n\nDuring the trial, prosecutors walked jurors repeatedly through the 11 invoices, 12 vouchers and 11 checks -- the 34 documents that make up the falsified business records charges -- that were used to pay Cohen $420,000 in 2017, money that included the reimbursement for the $130,000 hush money payment \"grossed up\" to account for taxes.\n\nProsecutors showed jurors how Cohen sent the Trump Organization monthly invoices for $35,000, which were processed by the Trump company's controller so checks could be cut. Trump signed nine of the 11 checks. (The other two checks were paid from Trump's revocable trust and signed by former Trump Org. Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg and one of Trump's sons.)\n\nKaren Friedman Agnifilo, who served for a time as a top prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, said she expects the prosecution to present several themes in their closing arguments, including that most of the people who testified for their case were \"Trump witnesses ... who you would expect to be friendly to him.\"\n\nThe other theme, she said, could be: \"Look at the kind of people Trump values,\" with prosecutors arguing the former president chose to surround himself with people such as Cohen and Pecker, who were doing Trump's bidding ahead of the 2016 election.\n\n\"These are his people, he chose them. And he shouldn't now get the benefit of, 'Because they're flawed you can't rely on them,'\" prosecutors might argue, Agnifilo said.\n\n\"And even if you do not rely on them,\" she said, echoing Honig, \"the third theme is going to be, 'You don't have to, because everything is corroborated either by other witnesses or documents or records or Trump's own words.'\"\n\nThe length of the trial may not ultimately prove to be much of a challenge for jurors during their deliberations, Villalona said, since they were allowed to jot down notes during the proceedings and will be able to request some parts of the trial be read back to them.\n\n\"The good thing about New York is that they could request to have the whole trial read back to them and the judge will do that,\" she said. \"So if they forgot something David Pecker said on Day 1 or 2 of the trial, they can have that read back.\" She added that any of the exhibits put into evidence could also be sent to the jurors for them to take a closer look as they mull a verdict.\n\nStill, the closing arguments from each side will be carefully crafted to win not only a verdict in their favor, but also to mark each attorneys' place in the historic trial, Villalona mused.\n\n\"The prosecution and the defense is going to give the closing argument of their career,\" she said.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

He is charged with falsifying business records to conceal a hush-money payment to a porn star in the weeks before voters that year would decide whether to elect him. They ended up handing him a stunning win.\n\nProsecutors say Trump directed his allies to quell bad press at all costs -- the payment was made in order to keep the story from becoming public -- because just one more scandal could upend his presidential aspirations. But defense attorneys contend Trump maintained a degree of separation from his allies working to launch him to the nation's highest office, unaware of any unlawful schemes they engaged in to get him there.\n\nAfter more than four weeks of testimony in Trump's criminal trial, from 22 witnesses who once made up his innermost circle, the former president's jury is expected to start weighing his innocence this week after closing arguments conclude Tuesday.\n\nTrump's jury is a melting pot of Manhattanites -- from a physical therapist to investment bankers and immigrants to lifelong New Yorkers.\n\nThey were selected to hear Trump's case over the course of four days in April, a process complicated by his controversial political reputation, deep ties to New York City and intense media coverage.\n\nBetween the seven men and five women on the jury, most are college-educated and follow a myriad of news outlets. Notably, two jurors are themselves lawyers.\n\nThough having lawyers on the panel might seem ideal in a case as complicated and high-stakes as Trump's, it could prove to be a \"double-edged sword,\" said Jeremy Saland, a former Manhattan prosecutor.\n\n\"You don't want the lawyer, who may be educated and understand the law, to impose for their own use of the law or reading of the law or understanding of the law on the rest of the jury,\" Saland said. \"And even if it's not intentional, you don't want the jury to rely on that lawyer to say, 'Oh, okay, that's what it means.' Or, 'Oh, thanks for explaining that area of law.'\"\n\n\"Even if it's not intentional, you don't want to give too much heft or weight; they are just as equal,\" he continued. \"This isn't an Orwellian novel -- you know, 'all jurors are equal, and some jurors are more equal than others.'\"\n\nOnce the jury retires to deliberation, lawyers serving among the 12 have equal chance of helping or hindering prosecutors in the Manhattan district attorney's case, said Loyola Marymount University law professor Jessica Levinson.\n\nProsecutors may be hoping the lawyer-jurors will act as their \"teaching assistants\" inside the deliberation room, Levinson said, walking jurors through several complicated steps to determine whether to convict Trump on what amounts to complicated campaign finance violations.\n\nHowever, they could just as easily point to the numerous elements jurors must unanimously agree upon to find Trump guilty and suggest that, if they fail to concur on just one, \"the whole thing breaks apart,\" she said.\n\nThere are several looming questions jurors must answer that could make or break the case.\n\nWhen the National Enquirer and its then-publisher, David Pecker, buried negative stories about Trump and highlighted bad news about his 2016 opponents, did they act in the interest of selling magazines or clearing Trump's path to the White House?\n\nWas porn actress Stormy Daniels's detailed testimony about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump unnecessary in a case about falsifying business records -- or did it prove that Trump had something to hide from voters?\n\nAnd perhaps most pertinent of all: Is Michael Cohen credible?\n\nAs Trump's ex-fixer who paid to keep Daniels quiet and coordinated other hush-money deals, Cohen was the district attorney's star witness and the last to take the stand in his case-in-chief.\n\nBefore jurors ever met Cohen, they were warned by prosecutors he has \"some baggage.\"\n\nNumerous witnesses called Cohen a \"jerk,\" an \"asshole\" and challenging to work with -- to the point that some sought to actively avoid him. The onetime personal attorney to Trump also pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance and other charges in connection with the plot in which Trump is now charged.\n\nDespite that, Cohen provided some of the most damning testimony against Trump.\n\nHe confirmed the 11 invoices he submitted to Trump, which underpin 11 of the charges the former president faces, were false records. He said that the $35,000 Trump paid him each month in 2017 was for \"minimal\" work for his then boss, undercutting defense arguments that those checks, from which another 11 Trump charges emerge, were a legal retainer.\n\nAnd, he spoke to the greater conspiracy of election influence that prosecutors aim to convince the jury took place, confirming he paid Daniels $130,000 for her silence and coordinated two other deals -- at Trump's direction.\n\n\"There are things that you just have to take Michael Cohen's word for,\" Epner said of the state's case, though he noted extensive corroboration in many instances. \"The most important is Michael Cohen is the only person -- our only source of direct evidence -- that Donald Trump ever heard the particulars for how this reimbursement scheme was going to work.\"\n\n\"And if Donald Trump didn't hear that and agree to that, he's not guilty,\" he added.\n\nOver three days of cross-examination, defense attorneys ripped Cohen as a liar whose hush-money deals were a rogue operation to which Trump was not privy. He admitted under cross-examination to stealing from the Trump Organization and to posting repeated condemnations of his ex-client online, including as the trial was ongoing.\n\nWith Cohen's credibility in dispute, the jury's perception of his testimony is a wild card -- a risky position for prosecutors, whose case is significantly strengthened by the ex-fixer's assertions.\n\n\"A lot of this is going to be directly and indirectly on the shoulders of Michael Cohen,\" Saland said. \"[Jurors] are going to have to say, 'Well, you know what? I don't like Michael Cohen. He's a conniving, lying, disreputable, selfish, revenge-driven little man. But at the same time, I can understand where he's coming from.'\"\n\nBut defense attorneys may have their own credibility issues with which the jury must reckon.\n\nTheir primary witness was Robert Costello, a lawyer who once advised Cohen and acted as a go-between for Trump's White House and his then-exiled fixer who was under federal investigation at the time.\n\nWhile Costello refuted Cohen's testimony that a \"pressure campaign\" was mounted against him, he groaned and groused at Judge Juan Merchan during his time on the stand -- causing the judge to admonish Costello -- and clear his courtroom.\n\nLegal experts agreed that jurors trust a judge more than anyone else in the courtroom.\n\n\"The jury is looking to the judge for keys and clues about what's credible and what's problematic,\" Levinson said. \"And when they see a witness having a kind of adult tantrum and then the judge clears the room -- that's a really important message to them.\"\n\nOnce the jury receives the case, they could deliver a verdict at any time.\n\nIf the jury finds Trump guilty, he will become the first U.S. president convicted of a crime -- and the first felon with a major political party's presumed nomination. If they acquit him, he will have accomplished another skirting of the law.\n\nSaland said it would be \"naive\" to think the magnitude of the jury's historic decision won't impact deliberations.\n\n\"Whether or not you think it's a foolish prosecution, a meritless prosecution or political prosecution -- or born from absolute justice and a necessary prosecution -- it doesn't matter,\" he said. \"Because if you're sitting in that jury room, no matter what you do or say, no matter what your outcome, it is going to have a ripple effect of magnitude potentially that we can't right now really contemplate.\"", "source": {"uri": "dcnewsnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DC News Now | Washington, DC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ella_lee@dcnewsnow.com", "name": "Ella Lee",

Catch up on key evidence and testimony from 6 weeks", "body": "The Trump trial could end this week. Catch up on key evidence and testimony from 6 weeks\n\nKinsey Crowley, USA TODAY\n\nMay 26, 2024 at 11:03 AM\n\nDonald Trump's hush money trial is entering its seventh and potentially final week.\n\nJurors have heard from more than 20 witnesses as prosecutors tried to build the case that the former president falsified business records to conceal reimbursements to his former lawyer Michael Cohen, who paid porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000 in 2016 to keep her unflattering claims about the presidential candidate under wraps.\n\nTestimony has swung from seedy details about the alleged sexual encounter to accounting processes within the Trump organization.\n\nBoth the defense team and the prosecution will recap their cases during closing arguments for the jury Tuesday, and the case will be in the hands of 12 Manhattanites shortly after.\n\nHere is a look back at the trial as we enter the homestretch:\n\n'This is not a conversation': Read heated exchange between Judge Merchan, Robert Costello\n\nProsecutors argue Trump falsified business records to cover up campaign finance violation\n\nAt the heart of the case is former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen's $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. Cohen pleaded guilty violating campaign finance laws in 2018 in relation to the payment. Trump denies Daniels' claim they had sex in 2006 while he was married to Melania Trump.\n\nProsecutors have tried to to show Trump falsified business records in order to conceal that crime, which would constitute a felony.\n\nMuch of the testimony set the scene for how Trump's campaign dealt with negative stories. Trump allies became concerned about his standing with women after the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape recording him talking about grabbing women's genitals came out in 2016, and several people testified on the levers they could pull to address those concerns.\n\nWho is David Pecker? Former head of National Enquirer expected as first witness in Donald Trump's trial\n\nEvidence: Michael Cohen's secret recording of Trump\n\nThis recording was teased in opening arguments and introduced through a witness, computer forensic analyst Douglas Daus. \"So, what do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump says in the conversation, allegedly referring to the hush money deal for former Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nMcDougal's hush money payment was issued by American Media Inc., parent company of the tabloid National Enquirer, and ultimately never repaid by Trump despite Cohen's promises.\n\nCohen also testified Trump knew about the hush money payment and praised Cohen once it was closed. \"Fantastic. Great job,\" Trump said, according to Cohen's testimony.\n\nDavid Pecker used National Enquirer to be 'eyes and ears' of Trump campaign in 2016\n\nDavid Pecker is the former CEO of the tabloid National Enquirer's parent company. He had been friendly with Trump since the 1980s, and met with Cohen and Trump in August of 2015.\n\nPecker testified that he promised to be \"eyes and ears\" because he knew the Trump Organization had a \"very small staff.\" Pecker said he promised that if he heard anything negative about Trump or anything about women selling stories, he would notify Michael Cohen, as he did over the last several years. Cohen would then have the stories killed, Pecker testified.\n\nIn addition to McDougal's life rights,, the tabloid paid $30,000 to silence a doorman at Trump Tower, Dino Sajudin, who was shopping a story that Trump fathered an extramarital child.\n\nHope Hicks, Keith Davidson, Michael Cohen testify on Access Hollywood tape watershed moment\n\nThe \"Access Hollywood\" tape, in which Trump boasted about grabbing women without consent, was released by the Washington Post on Oct. 7, 2016. While jurors did not see the video, the transcript was entered into evidence.\n\nSeveral witnesses, including former Trump aide Hope Hicks, a lawyer who represented Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in their hush money deals, and Cohen discussed how damaging it was to Trump's campaign.\n\n\"\"It wasn't until 'Access Hollywood' that the interest sort of reached a crescendo,\" lawyer Keith Davidson testified about Stormy Daniels' story.\n\nHicks said the video eventually raised concern in the Trump campaign about his standing with women voters. \"Not in that moment, but certainly eventually that was something that was raised,\" Hicks said on the stand.\n\n\"(Trump) wanted me to reach out to all of my contacts in the media. We needed to put a spin on this. And the spin that he wanted put on it was that this is locker room talk,\" Cohen testified about the tape, \"and use that in order to get control over the story and to minimize its impact on him and his campaign.\"\n\n'What have we done?' Stormy Daniels' attorney thought hush money aided Trump in 2016 election\n\nTrump lawyers asked for mistrial after Stormy Daniels 'dog whistle for rape' testimony\n\nDaniels' testimony included intimate details about the alleged sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 at a golf tournament in Lake Tahoe. She said the evening left her shaking, and that she didn't so no but, \"didn't say anything at all.\"\n\nTrump's defense lawyer Todd Blanche requested a mistrial after Daniels' testimony, saying portions of her testimony were \"dog whistle for rape,\" and could make the jury prejudicial against Trump.\n\nBut Merchan denied the motion, pointing out that Blanche had denied that Daniels' story was true at all in his opening statements.\n\n\"Your denial puts the jury in a position of having to choose who they believe,\" Merchan said at the time.\n\n'Oh my god': Stormy Daniels testifies on spanking Trump, his gold tweezers, and silky PJs\n\nAlleged reimbursement scheme: 'He approved it.'\n\nIn key testimony for the prosecution, Cohen testified he met with Donald Trump and Allen Weisselberg and Trump approved the plan to repay Cohen for Stormy Daniels' hush money through a scheme that involved stretching out payments over 12 months in 2017.\n\nIn Trump's presence, Weisselberg said during the meeting that the money would be repaid as a monthly retainer for legal services, Cohen testified. A legal retainer is an agreement with a lawyer about compensation that reserves a lawyer or pays for future services.\n\nIn earlier testimony, Jeffrey McConney, the former controller at the Trump Organization, calculated how the $130,000 allegedly netted out to $35,000 monthly payments for Cohen's \"retainer.\" The $130,000 paid to Keith M Davidson Associates PLC, plus $50,000 paid for technology services, doubled to pay for taxes, plus a $60,000 bonus, equaled $420,000. At a monthly rate for one year, McConney testified, that came to $35,000. Tarasoff testified the check from Trump's personal account was signed by Trump. Cohen admitted to stealing from the Trump Organization by overstating the technology services costs he paid, as part of this repayment.\n\nWeisselberg said the money to Cohen was a monthly retainer even though the three men were actually discussing repaying Cohen for the hush money, as well as giving him a bonus and repaying him for a separate expense, according to Cohen's testimony.\n\n\"He approved it,\" Cohen told jurors, speaking about Trump.\n\nDid Cohen convince the jury? Michael Cohen's testimony in Trump hush money trial impressed experts, but suffered setbacks\n\nDefense witness Robert Costello scolded for 'contemptuous' behavior\n\nTrump's defense team called Republican lawyer Robert Costello as their second and last witness. After numerous objections from the prosecution were sustained, Costello appeared to get frustrated.\n\n'Jeez!' Costello said in the witness box, at a normal volume - but with an exasperated tone - after a sustained objection.\n\n\"Sorry? I'm sorry?\" Merchan said heatedly to Costello. Costello then said \"strike it,\" seeming to refer to striking his own testimony from the court record.\n\nCostello continued testifying, and then he dramatically sighed after another objection was sustained. Merchan then excused the jurors from the courtroom and said to Costello: \"I want to discuss proper decorum in my courtroom.\"\n\nCostello later testified on some statements Cohen made, particularly about how he previously told Costello he did not have any evidence against Trump when the FBI raided his home in 2018.\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY:

Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nThe jury will start deliberations once closing arguments end and the judge has delivered instructions to the jury. It's unclear how long it will take before they reach a verdict. If Trump is convicted, each felony count against him is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 per offense and/or up to four years in prison, meaning Trump faces up to $170,000 in fines and 136 years in prison if he were convicted on every count and sentenced to the maximum. Legal experts believe it's unlikely Trump would be sentenced to prison as a first-time offender -- though it's not out of the question. His sentencing would likely take place one or two months after the verdict.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him and decried the case as a \"witch hunt\" designed to hurt his campaign. The ex-president complained Monday on Truth Social that his lawyers are making their arguments first, saying allowing prosecutors to go last is a \"BIG ADVANTAGE, VERY UNFAIR.\" The order is not unique to his case, however: defense attorneys are required to give their closing arguments first under New York law, given that prosecutors are the ones who must provide the burden of proof showing Trump's guilt.\n\nTrump was indicted in Manhattan in March 2023 following a yearslong investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney's office, and this case marks the first of his four criminal cases to go to trial. Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 just before the 2016 election in order to cover up her allegations of an affair, which Trump has long denied. Trump then reimbursed Cohen through a series of checks paid throughout 2017 that prosecutors argue were falsely labeled as being for legal services, which Trump also denies. Cohen later pleaded guilty to campaign finance crimes stemming from his payment to Daniels, and testified during the weekslong trial that Trump was directly involved with the hush money scheme and approved the payment. Trump's lawyers have sought to discredit Cohen, with attorney Todd Blanche cross-examining him four three days about Cohen's frequent criticism of the ex-president and history of lying under oath. Closing arguments come after the defense presented only one major witness before resting its case last week. Attorney Robert Costello tried to undercut Cohen's testimony by testifying Cohen told him Trump had no knowledge of the hush money payment, though Costello's testimony got derailed as Judge Juan Merchan admonished him for rolling his eyes and expressing annoyance with the judge.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Witch-hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burden of proof (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6655d48bdaad0c6a2f04adf5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3035,1707,x0,y10,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Also, Trump's lawyers charge, the recording of the payments to Cohen as \"legal services\" was accurate. Pursuing Trump, they have argued, smacks of politics. And the prosecution's theory that Trump broke state election law? That's just how democracy works -- candidates attempt to positively influence the electorate. Trump has also denied the affair.\n\nTrump, 77, has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records as part of what prosecutors argue was a ''catch and kill strategy\" to buy negative stories and bury them. Daniels testified as a prosecution witness, giving explicit details of the sexual encounter she allegedly had with Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, in 2006.\n\nThe charges have been upgraded to felony-level crimes because Manhattan District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg argued they were part of a conspiracy to cover up another crime -- conspiracy to promote an election by unlawful means.\n\nTwo months after Trump announced his candidacy for president in 2015, according to testimony from David Pecker, the former chairman and publisher of American Media Inc. -- the parent company of the National Enquirer -- he was summoned by Cohen for a meeting at Trump Tower.\n\n\"At that meeting Donald Trump and Cohen, they asked me what I can do and what my magazines can do to help the campaign,\" Pecker testified. \"I said what I would do is I would run or publish positive stories about Mr. Trump and I would publish negative stories about his opponents. I also said that 'I would be your eyes and ears.' I said that anything that I hear in the marketplace, if I hear anything negative about yourself or if I hear anything about selling stories, I would notify Michael Cohen.\"\n\nThat was the birth of what prosecutors alleged in their opening statement to the jury was a \"criminal conspiracy\" between the three men, in which Pecker and his top editor would alert Cohen to negative stories about Trump that were pitched to the supermarket tabloid by celebrity publicists and lawyers.\n\nIn three instances, according to prosecutors, Trump paid to silence those making accusations against him, including Daniels.\n\nTrump, described as penny-pinching during the trial, was moved to open his wallet in order to save his prospects of winning the 2016 presidential election, according to prosecutors.\n\nIt was in early October 2016 -- about a month before Election Day -- when The Washington Post published the \"Access Hollywood\" video of Trump bragging about grabbing women by their genitals.\n\n\"When you're a star, they let you do it,\" Trump said on the recording, a transcript of which was provided to the jury.\n\nThe release of the video was disastrous for the campaign, testified Hope Hicks, a former Trump campaign and White House aide, who also testified she didn't know Cohen to be charitable or selfless, but someone who \"seeks\" credit.\n\n\"This is a disaster,\" Trump said in an October 2016 phone call with Cohen, according to Trump's former fixer. \"This is a total disaster. Women will hate me. Guys will think it's cool but women will hate me. This is a total disaster for the campaign.\"\n\nProsecutors also played for the jury a 2-minute, 31-second audio file of Cohen telling Trump about setting up a shell company to make the hush money payments.\n\n\"I need to open up the company for the transfer of all that info for our friend David. I'm going to do that right away. I've spoken to [Trump's then-chief financial officer] Allen Weisselberg about how to set the whole thing up,\" Cohen told Trump.\n\n\"We'll pay cash,\" the former president said on the recording.\n\nOver days of cross-examination, Trump defense attorney Todd Blanche sought to discredit the Manhattan district attorney's star witness by painting him as a serial liar and perjurer.\n\nCohen has served prison time after pleading guilty to various federal charges, including lying to Congress and a bank and engaging in campaign-finance violations related to the hush money scheme.\n\nBlanche also attempted to paint Cohen as a man out for revenge against Trump, who didn't give him a plum job in the White House. Cohen admitted regularly denouncing Trump on social media and making millions of dollars in proceeds from books he's written about Trump.\n\nCohen also admitted, while under cross-examination, that he stole $30,000 from the Trump Organization when he was reimbursed $50,000 for payments to a computer services company called Red Finch.\n\nThe defense called Robert Costello, a former federal prosecutor, as a witness for its brief case, to contradict some of Cohen's claims. But Costello, a Nassau resident, was almost removed from the witness stand after he muttered \"ridiculous\" and \"jeez\" in a show of apparent annoyance with Supreme Court Justice Juan M. Merchan's rulings.\n\nTrump, despite saying multiple times he would testify, did not take the stand, as is his right as a criminal defendant.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news",

After more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments Tuesday.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they won't be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence -- and there were many. Judge Juan M. Merchan, for instance, fined Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases Trump is confronting as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nWhere each Trump case stands Classified documents case Election interference Hush money scheme Georgia election indictment Arizona election indictment Civil cases\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Trump's legal team called two witnesses of their own, and the former president himself did not testify.\n\nInstead, they have tried to raise doubts about the credibility of prosecution witnesses, most notably Michael Cohen, who testified that as Trump's fixer, he handled the payment to Daniels and that Trump approved the cover-up.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Trump's lawyers got Cohen to discuss his felony convictions and imprisonment, his history of lying and his lingering animosity for his former boss. Cohen also admitted to stealing from Trump's company.\n\nIf found guilty, Trump faces up to four years in prison, although imprisonment is unlikely for a first-time felon convicted of such a crime. A conviction will not prevent Trump from trying to take back the White House from Democratic President Joe Biden as the Republican candidate in the November 5 election, and it would not prevent him from taking office if he won. Opinion polls show the two candidates locked in a tight race.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, normally a misdemeanour under New York law.\n\nProsecutors in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office elevated those charges to felonies, saying Trump falsified those records to disguise what amounted to an illegal campaign contribution: the payment that bought Daniels' silence about the alleged 2006 sexual encounter at a time when Trump was already facing multiple accusations of sexual misconduct.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing. His lawyers have implied that the $1,30,000 payment for Daniels' silence was intended to spare Trump's family from embarrassment, not to protect his White House bid. Prosecutors will cite testimony to argue otherwise. Trump faces three other criminal prosecutions as well, but none is likely to go to trial before the election.\n\nSeparate cases in Washington and Georgia accuse him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat, while another case in Florida charges him with mishandling classified information after he left office in 2021. Trump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases and says they are an effort by Biden's Democratic allies to hobble his presidential bid.\n\n(With inputs from agency)", "source": {"uri":

After more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nPeople are also reading... 2 men killed in early morning shooting at southwest Lincoln strip club Amie Just: Friday night football at Memorial Stadium is bound to be a logistical nightmare Tornado hits Lake McConaughy; trees damaged in Lincoln by overnight storms Nebraska wins its first Big Ten baseball tournament championship Owners of ex-Railyard restaurant ordered to pay $471K for back rent Nebraska football hosting Big Ten Friday night game on Fox Former Lincoln radio host Jack Riggins sues successor Dan Parsons for defamation 'Lincoln was really lucky' -- Beloved longtime child care center closes its doors Nebraska baseball punches ticket to Big Ten tournament championship game Lincoln singer Bryan Olesen takes third on 'The Voice' City of Lincoln ordered to pay $727K in attorney fees, costs in settled discrimination lawsuit Nebraska football notes: Former NU staffer named in lawsuit, ex-Huskers on the move Lincoln teen charged with first-degree murder of 16-year-old boy After recruiting snag, Kahmir Prescott regained his edge with belief from Nebraska Nebraska baseball stays alive in the Big Ten tournament with win over Purdue\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys will aim to create doubts about the strength of evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and who served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\nAfter the closing arguments are given, the judge will instruct the jury, likely Wednesday, on the law governing the case and the factors it can take into account during deliberations. The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments Tuesday.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they won't be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence -- and there were many. Judge Juan M. Merchan, for instance, fined Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases Trump is confronting as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nWhere each Trump case stands Classified documents case Election interference Hush money scheme Georgia election indictment Civil cases Arizona election indictment\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

citing her understanding of Cohen's character as a reason to doubt it.\n\nDavid Pecker, former National Enquirer publisher, told the trial for several days how the former president used his influence in the media sphere to kill negative stories via \"fixer\" Cohen.\n\nHe told the trial he knew that the $150,000 hush money payment he made to Ms McDougal to buy her life story rights and essentially silence her was probably against the law - because it was coordinated with Trump's political campaign.\n\nOn day 20 of the trial, the former president's defence rested without calling him to the stand.\n\nInstead, former federal prosecutor Robert Costello was called as the final witness.\n\nMr Costello said Cohen insisted that he had made the Daniels deal on his own, that Trump \"knew nothing\" about it.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts and claimed the trial is the result of a politically motivated justice system working to deprive him of another term as president.\n\nIf convicted of falsifying business records, Trump faces up to four years in prison, though there is no guarantee he will get time behind bars.", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karen McDougal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pecker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Pecker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hope Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Enquirer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Enquirer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Merchant_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Merchant Services", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/24/05/1600x900/skynews-donald-trump-new-york_6561932.jpg?20240521151604", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial.\n\n- Other cases -\n\nAside from Daniels, the key prosecution witness was Michael Cohen, Trump's former \"fixer\" turned bitter foe who arranged the $130,000 hush money payment.\n\nWalking jurors through the reasoning behind the payments, Cohen said they were made \"to ensure that the story would not come out, would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States.\"\n\nTrump's defense team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.\n\nThe defense called only two witnesses of their own before resting.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.\n\nNone of those trials are expected to take place before the November election.\n\ncl/st/acb\n\nMore from this section\n\nHuman Rights Group Marches in Protest to Demand RANZCP End Dangerous Coercive Psychiatric Practices as

Then, the 12 ordinary New Yorkers who sit on the jury will begin deliberations on whether or not the former president is guilty of the charges against him.\n\nThe defense will present its argument first, with Trump's lead attorney Todd Blanche expected to tell the jury that prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office had not met their burden of proving Trump guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the closing days of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe charge is a felony punishable by up to four years in prison, and Trump is charged with 34 counts.\n\nIn his opening statement, Blanche told the panel of 12 jurors and six alternates that \"President Trump is innocent. President Trump did not commit any crimes.\" Blanche also told the jury no crime had been committed, and the money that Trump paid to his then-lawyer Michael Cohen was for his legal work, as Trump's company records show, and not for the Daniels payment, as prosecutors and Cohen have maintained.\n\n\"This was not a payback,\" Blanche said in his April 22 opening.\n\nProsecutors are expected to argue that not only did they prove Trump was responsible for the falsified business records, but that he did so to cover up another crime -- a necessary element of the felony charge.\n\nIn his opening statement, prosecutor Matthew Colangelo said the disguised payment to Cohen was part of a \"planned, coordinated long-running conspiracy to influence the 2016 election, to help Donald Trump get elected through illegal expenditures, to silence people who had something bad to say about his behavior, using doctored corporate records and bank forms to conceal those payments along the way.\"\n\n\"It was election fraud. Pure and simple,\" he told the jury.\n\nWhen summations are done, Judge Juan Merchan will instruct the jury on the relevant laws and the deliberations process, which is expected to take about an hour. The jury will then begin deliberating. Merchan said in court last week that deliberations might not start until Wednesday morning.\n\nThe trial -- which featured testimony from Cohen, Daniels, ex-National Enquirer publisher David Pecker and former White House and Trump Organization staffers -- began with jury selection on April 15. Witness testimony, which started on April 22, wrapped up last week. In all, the prosecution called 20 witnesses in the case, while the defense called two.

Catch up on key evidence and testimony from 6 weeks", "body": "Jurors have heard from more than 20 witnesses as prosecutors tried to build the case that the former president falsified business records to conceal reimbursements to his former lawyer Michael Cohen, who paid porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000 in 2016 to keep her unflattering claims about the presidential candidate under wraps.\n\nTestimony has swung from seedy details about the alleged sexual encounter to accounting processes within the Trump organization.\n\nBoth the defense team and the prosecution will recap their cases during closing arguments for the jury Tuesday, and the case will be in the hands of 12 Manhattanites shortly after.\n\nHere is a look back at the trial as we enter the homestretch:\n\n'This is not a conversation': Read heated exchange between Judge Merchan, Robert Costello\n\nProsecutors argue Trump falsified business records to cover up campaign finance violation\n\nAt the heart of the case is former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen's $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. Cohen pleaded guilty violating campaign finance laws in 2018 in relation to the payment. Trump denies Daniels' claim they had sex in 2006 while he was married to Melania Trump.\n\nProsecutors have tried to to show Trump falsified business records in order to conceal that crime, which would constitute a felony.\n\nMuch of the testimony set the scene for how Trump's campaign dealt with negative stories. Trump allies became concerned about his standing with women after the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape recording him talking about grabbing women's genitals came out in 2016, and several people testified on the levers they could pull to address those concerns.\n\nWho is David Pecker? Former head of National Enquirer expected as first witness in Donald Trump's trial\n\nEvidence: Michael Cohen's secret recording of Trump\n\nThis recording was teased in opening arguments and introduced through a witness, computer forensic analyst Douglas Daus. \"So, what do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump says in the conversation, allegedly referring to the hush money deal for former Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nMcDougal's hush money payment was issued by American Media Inc., parent company of the tabloid National Enquirer, and ultimately never repaid by Trump despite Cohen's promises.\n\nCohen also testified Trump knew about the hush money payment and praised Cohen once it was closed. \"Fantastic. Great job,\" Trump said, according to Cohen's testimony.\n\nDavid Pecker used National Enquirer to be 'eyes and ears' of Trump campaign in 2016\n\nDavid Pecker is the former CEO of the tabloid National Enquirer's parent company. He had been friendly with Trump since the 1980s, and met with Cohen and Trump in August of 2015.\n\nPecker testified that he promised to be \"eyes and ears\" because he knew the Trump Organization had a \"very small staff.\" Pecker said he promised that if he heard anything negative about Trump or anything about women selling stories, he would notify Michael Cohen, as he did over the last several years. Cohen would then have the stories killed, Pecker testified.\n\nIn addition to McDougal's life rights,, the tabloid paid $30,000 to silence a doorman at Trump Tower, Dino Sajudin, who was shopping a story that Trump fathered an extramarital child.\n\nHope Hicks, Keith Davidson, Michael Cohen testify on Access Hollywood tape watershed moment\n\nThe \"Access Hollywood\" tape, in which Trump boasted about grabbing women without consent, was released by the Washington Post on Oct. 7, 2016. While jurors did not see the video, the transcript was entered into evidence.\n\nSeveral witnesses, including former Trump aide Hope Hicks, a lawyer who represented Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in their hush money deals, and Cohen discussed how damaging it was to Trump's campaign.\n\n\"\"It wasn't until 'Access Hollywood' that the interest sort of reached a crescendo,\" lawyer Keith Davidson testified about Stormy Daniels' story.\n\nHicks said the video eventually raised concern in the Trump campaign about his standing with women voters. \"Not in that moment, but certainly eventually that was something that was raised,\" Hicks said on the stand.\n\n\"(Trump) wanted me to reach out to all of my contacts in the media. We needed to put a spin on this. And the spin that he wanted put on it was that this is locker room talk,\" Cohen testified about the tape, \"and use that in order to get control over the story and to minimize its impact on him and his campaign.\"\n\n'What have we done?' Stormy Daniels' attorney thought hush money aided Trump in 2016 election\n\nTrump lawyers asked for mistrial after Stormy Daniels 'dog whistle for rape' testimony\n\nDaniels' testimony included intimate details about the alleged sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 at a golf tournament in Lake Tahoe. She said the evening left her shaking, and that she didn't so no but, \"didn't say anything at all.\"\n\nTrump's defense lawyer Todd Blanche requested a mistrial after Daniels' testimony, saying portions of her testimony were \"dog whistle for rape,\" and could make the jury prejudicial against Trump.\n\nBut Merchan denied the motion, pointing out that Blanche had denied that Daniels' story was true at all in his opening statements.\n\n\"Your denial puts the jury in a position of having to choose who they believe,\" Merchan said at the time.\n\n'Oh my god': Stormy Daniels testifies on spanking Trump, his gold tweezers, and silky PJs\n\nAlleged reimbursement scheme: 'He approved it.'\n\nIn key testimony for the prosecution, Cohen testified he met with Donald Trump and Allen Weisselberg and Trump approved the plan to repay Cohen for Stormy Daniels' hush money through a scheme that involved stretching out payments over 12 months in 2017.\n\nIn Trump's presence, Weisselberg said during the meeting that the money would be repaid as a monthly retainer for legal services, Cohen testified. A legal retainer is an agreement with a lawyer about compensation that reserves a lawyer or pays for future services.\n\nIn earlier testimony, Jeffrey McConney, the former controller at the Trump Organization, calculated how the $130,000 allegedly netted out to $35,000 monthly payments for Cohen's \"retainer.\" The $130,000 paid to Keith M Davidson Associates PLC, plus $50,000 paid for technology services, doubled to pay for taxes, plus a $60,000 bonus, equaled $420,000. At a monthly rate for one year, McConney testified, that came to $35,000. Tarasoff testified the check from Trump's personal account was signed by Trump. Cohen admitted to stealing from the Trump Organization by overstating the technology services costs he paid, as part of this repayment.\n\nWeisselberg said the money to Cohen was a monthly retainer even though the three men were actually discussing repaying Cohen for the hush money, as well as giving him a bonus and repaying him for a separate expense, according to Cohen's testimony.\n\n\"He approved it,\" Cohen told jurors, speaking about Trump.\n\nDid Cohen convince the jury? Michael Cohen's testimony in Trump hush money trial impressed experts, but suffered setbacks\n\nDefense witness Robert Costello scolded for 'contemptuous' behavior\n\nTrump's defense team called Republican lawyer Robert Costello as their second and last witness. After numerous objections from the prosecution were sustained, Costello appeared to get frustrated.\n\n'Jeez!' Costello said in the witness box, at a normal volume - but with an exasperated tone - after a sustained objection.\n\n\"Sorry? I'm sorry?\" Merchan said heatedly to Costello. Costello then said \"strike it,\" seeming to refer to striking his own testimony from the court record.\n\nCostello continued testifying, and then he dramatically sighed after another objection was sustained. Merchan then excused the jurors from the courtroom and said to Costello: \"I want to discuss proper decorum in my courtroom.\"\n\nCostello later testified on some statements Cohen made, particularly about how he previously told Costello he did not have any evidence against Trump when the FBI raided his home in 2018.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"},

Major week looms in Trump hush money trial", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- The testimony in Donald Trump's New York hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict.\n\nIt's impossible to say how long all of that will take, but in a landmark trial that's already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could easily be the most important.\n\nHere's what to expect in the days ahead:\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nStarting Tuesday morning, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments expected to last for much of the day, if not all of it.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election to a porn star who alleged she had a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nLook for prosecutors to remind jurors that they can trust the financial paperwork they've seen and the witnesses they've heard from. That includes porn actor Stormy Daniels, whose account of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump is at the heart of the case, and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme and authorized payments.\n\nIt's worth remembering that the defense, which called only two witnesses but not Trump, doesn't have to prove anything or convince jurors of Trump's innocence.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nExpect the defense to try to poke holes in the government's case by disputing Daniels' testimony about her hotel suite encounter with Trump and by distancing Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements to Cohen, who was responsible for the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels.\n\nThe defense may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid.\n\nAnd it'll certainly attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand. How much of his testimony the jury believes will go a long way in determining the outcome of the case.\n\nSince the prosecution has the burden of proof, it will deliver its summation last -- the reverse order from opening statements, in which the prosecution went first.\n\nONE LAST THING BEFORE THE JURY DELIBERATES\n\nA critical moment will take place, perhaps Wednesday morning, before the jury begins its deliberations.\n\nToday's Top Headlines\n\nStory continues below\n\nColumbia man killed in shooting on Myrtle Beach's Ocean Boulevard Summerville native who starred in General Hospital killed by thieves in L.A. shooting Man arrested in connection with Palmetto State Armory theft of over 150 guns Missing Walterboro primate identified as Bradley the Japanese macaque Spartanburg's WestGate Mall sells for $15M, ending 7-month search for new owner.

Merchan is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nIn an indication of just how important those instructions are, prosecutors and defense lawyers had a spirited debate last week outside the jury's presence as they sought to persuade Merchan about the instructions he should give.\n\nThe Trump team, for instance, sought an instruction informing jurors that the types of hush money payments at issue in Trump's case are not inherently illegal, a request a prosecutor called \"totally inappropriate.\" Merchan said such an instruction would go too far and is unnecessary.\n\nTrump's team also asked Merchan to consider the \"extraordinarily important\" nature of the case when issuing his instructions and to urge jurors to reach \"very specific findings.\" Prosecutors objected to that as well, and Merchan agreed that it would be wrong to deviate from the standard instructions.\n\n\"When you say it's a very important case, you're asking me to change the law, and I'm not going to do that,\" Merchan said.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, requested an instruction that someone's status as a candidate doesn't need to be the sole motivation for making a payment that benefits the campaign. Defense lawyers asked for jurors to be told that if a payment would have been made even if the person wasn't running, it shouldn't be treated as a campaign contribution.\n\nONCE THE JURY GETS THE CASE\n\nThe deliberations will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that's intentionally opaque.\n\nJurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it's hard to read too much into the meaning of any note.\n\nIt's anyone's guess how long the jury will deliberate for and there's no time limit either. The jury must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records, so that could take some time, and a verdict might not come by the end of the week.\n\nTo reach a verdict on any given count, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it.\n\nThings will get trickier if the jury can't reach a consensus after several days of deliberations. Though defense lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial, Merchan is likely to call the jurors in and instruct them to keep trying for a verdict and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others.\n\nIf, after that instruction, the jury still can't reach a verdict, the judge would have the option to deem the panel hopelessly deadlocked and declare a mistrial.\n\nAssociated Press writers Jennifer Peltz, Michael R.

of becoming president of the United States.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump's defense team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.\n\nThe defense called only two witnesses of their own before resting.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White

Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies the affair. Despite the structure of the falsified records charges, he has not been charged with any other crimes.\n\nHere is what to know as closing arguments in the historic first criminal trial against a former president begin.\n\nOn Tuesday, both Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's prosecutors and Trump's attorneys will present their closing arguments, providing a summary of the key points they presented throughout the roughly four weeks of testimony. These arguments are not evidence, but will serve to reinforce their narratives to the jury. Prosecutors will likely emphasize the credibility of the Trump Organization's financial documents and testimony from key witnesses, including Daniels and Michael Cohen, who implicated Trump in the hush money payments.\n\nThe closing arguments come after the 12-member jury, which has six alternates, took a weeklong break from the trial beginning last Tuesday and extending through Memorial Day. Trump attorney Alina Habba argued on Monday that the jury should have been sequestered over concerns that the long break and potential conversations with peers could influence their decisions.\n\n\"And for them to be able to be out and about on a holiday weekend with friends and families who have opinions, who are watching the news, TVs in the background at the pool party, I have serious concerns. If they're left-wing and they're watching MSDNC, as my client calls it, [MSNBC] or CNN, they're not going to get fair news,\" Habba told Fox News.\n\nThe defense, having called only two witnesses and not Trump, needs to instill reasonable doubt in at least one juror to avoid a conviction. They are expected to challenge Daniels' testimony and Cohen's credibility, arguing that Trump's primary concern was protecting his family, not influencing the election.\n\nSome lawyers have said Trump's team will need to present an argument \"that raises reasonable doubt,\" according to attorney George Conway, who told MSNBC Saturday he believed it would be the way for Trump to gain a full acquittal.\n\n\"I think their best shot, and that's what they're gonna do, is hope that there's just some person on the jury who just refuses to convict,\" Conway said.\n\nBut other legal experts said Trump's legal team, led by Todd Blanche, Susan Necheles, and Emil Bove, might flag to the jury that the prosecution's key witness never took the stand. That witness is Allen Weisselberg, the former Trump Organization CFO who, prosecutors say, was in a room with Trump and Cohen at Trump Tower when they worked out the details of what Bragg's team described as a conspiracy.\n\nWeisselberg was never called to the stand in part because he is currently serving time for a crime that began with him making false statements in a court of law. He was sentenced to five months in Rikers Island after pleading guilty to perjury in an unrelated civil case involving Trump, a man with whom he worked for nearly 50 years.\n\nProsecutors likely thought Weisselberg's testimony could damage their case further, given that Cohen has a past of inconsistent testimony. Trump lawyers also did not choose him to call the longtime CFO to the stand. It's not clear if Weisselberg would have confirmed Cohen's version of events had he been called to testify.\n\nThe defense \"just needs to point out the failures to prove and failures to call relevant witnesses that might have had information that could give the jury more to think about,\" attorney Katie Cherkasky told the Washington Examiner earlier this month.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan will instruct the jury on the legal standards they must follow before they decide on the verdict. This step, possibly happening on Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday morning, is crucial because it guides jurors on what to consider during deliberations.\n\nThe jury will then deliberate in private, evaluating 34 counts of falsifying business records. This process is confidential and can vary in length. Jurors may request clarifications or testimony excerpts, but the exact nature of their discussions is unknown.\n\nThere are also two lawyers on the jury, a rather uncommon occurrence after a thorough jury selection processes. Some lawyers have said the pair of attorneys on the jury could take on a \"strong leadership position\" that could affect the votes of the other 10 members.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nA unanimous decision is required for a verdict on each count of business falsifications made between February and December of 2017.

Trump denies Daniels's allegation of a sexual encounter in 2006, when he was married to his current wife, Melania Trump.\n\nThe defence will try to raise doubts about the credibility of prosecution witnesses, most notably Michael Cohen, who testified that as Trump's fixer he handled the payment to Daniels and that Trump approved the cover-up.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Trump's lawyers got Cohen to discuss his felony convictions and imprisonment -- some of which were unrelated to his former boss -- as well as his history of lying and his lingering animosity for Trump. Cohen also admitted to stealing from Trump's company.\n\nTrump's legal team called two witnesses of their own, and the former president himself did not testify.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, normally a misdemeanour under New York law.\n\nProsecutors in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office elevated those charges to felonies, saying Trump falsified those records to disguise what amounted to an illegal campaign contribution: the payment that bought Daniels's silence at a time when Trump was already facing multiple accusations of sexual misconduct.\n\nTrump's lawyers have implied that the $130,000 US payment for Daniels's silence was intended to spare his family from embarrassment, not to protect his White House bid.\n\nIf found guilty, Trump faces up to four years in prison, although imprisonment is unlikely for a first-time felon convicted of such a crime.\n\nA conviction will not prevent Trump from trying to take back the White House from Democratic President Joe Biden as the Republican candidate in the Nov. 5 election, and it would not prevent him from taking office if he won.\n\nOpinion polls show a guilty verdict could pose danger for Trump in a tight race. One in four Republicans said they would not vote for Trump if he is found guilty in a criminal trial, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll of registered voters in April. In the same survey, 60 per cent of independents said they would not vote for Trump if he is convicted of a crime.\n\nA guilty verdict would also divert more financial resources to legal bills, as he would be expected to launch an appeal.\n\nOnce the trial ends, Trump will also be free of a gag order imposed by Judge Juan M. Merchan, meaning he could continue to lash out at the judge and other perceived enemies.\n\nTrump faces three other criminal prosecutions as well, but none is likely to go to trial before the election as they each have been beset with delays and outstanding legal questions.\n\nSeparate cases in Washington and Georgia accuse him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat, while another

Each side wants to score final points with the jury Tuesday (May 28, 2024) before it starts deliberating the fate of the first former American president charged with felony crimes. The arguments are expected to last the entire day. They'll give the attorneys one last chance to address the jury hearing the landmark case. After four weeks of testimony, the lawyers' arguments set the stage for deliberations in the case charging Trump in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter. The Republican ex-president denies wrongdoing.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- A defense witness in Donald Trump's New York hush money case whom the judge threatened to remove over his behavior will return to the stand as the trial nears its end. Trump's lawyers are hoping Robert Costello's testimony Tuesday (May 21, 2024) will help undermine the credibility of a key prosecution witness, Trump fixer-turned-foe Michael Cohen. But Costello angered the judge Monday, prompting the judge to briefly kick reporters out of the courtroom to admonish him. The chaotic scene unfolded after prosecutors rested their case accusing the Republican ex-president of falsifying business records as part of a scheme to bury stories he feared could hurt his 2016 campaign. Trump denies any wrongdoing.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- The third week of testimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial is drawing to a close. It comes after jurors heard the dramatic, if not downright steamy, account of Stormy Daniels' alleged sexual encounter with the former president. Meanwhile, prosecutors are gearing up for their most crucial witness: former Trump attorney Michael Cohen. Daniels' story was a necessary building block for prosecutors. They are seeking to show that Trump and his allies bought up and buried potentially damaging stories in the waning weeks of the 2016 presidential election in an effort to illegally influence the race. Trump denies any wrongdoing, telling reporters Thursday (May 9, 2024), \"I'm innocent.\"\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump returns to his New York hush money trial facing a threat of jail time for additional gag order violations as prosecutors gear up to summon big-name witnesses. One witness is porn actor Stormy Daniels, who has said she had a sexual encounter with Trump. Another witness is Michael Cohen, the ex-Trump lawyer and fixer who prosecutors say paid Daniels to keep silent in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign. Daniels and Cohen are expected to testify in the coming weeks. Trial testimony resumes Tuesday (May 7, 2024). Trump is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with the hush money payments. The Republican has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump has been held in contempt of court and fined $9,000 for repeatedly violating a gag order that barred him from making public statements about witnesses, jurors and some others connected to his New York hush money case. The judge warned that Trump could be jailed if he violates the order again. Prosecutors had alleged 10 violations, but New York Judge Juan M. Merchan found there were nine. Still, the decision Tuesday (April 30, 2024) is a rebuke for the Republican former president, who had insisted he was exercising his free speech rights. The ruling came at the start of the second week of testimony in the historic case.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Opening statements in Donald Trump's historic hush money trial are set to begin. The statements expected Monday (April 22, 2024) will set the stage for weeks of testimony about the former president's personal life and placing his legal troubles at the center of his closely contested campaign against President Joe Biden. Trump is accused of falsifying internal business records as part of an alleged scheme to bury stories he thought might hurt his presidential campaign in 2016. It's the first of Trump's four indictments to go to the trial and the first criminal trial against a former U.S. president. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Two jurors in Donald Trump's hush money trial have been dismissed, one after expressing doubt about her ability to be fair and the other over concerns that some of his answers in court may have been inaccurate. The dismissals on Thursday (April 18, 2024) reduced to five the number of jurors who have been seated for the first-ever criminal trial of a former president. The setbacks in the selection process emerged during a frenetic morning in which prosecutors also asked for Trump to be held in contempt over a series of social media posts this week. Meanwhile, the judge barred reporters from identifying jurors' employers after expressing privacy concerns.\n\nWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump boarded his private plane Monday (April 3, 2023) and flew from Florida for New York ahead of his expected booking and arraignment as the nation's largest city bolstered security and warned potential agitators that it is \"not a playground for your misplaced anger.\" Trump's journey from his Mar-a-Lago club took him past supporters waving banners and cheering the former president as they slammed the case against him -- stemming from hush money payments during his 2016 campaign -- as politically motivated. The scene is poised be quite different in New York, where Trump built a national profile in business and entertainment but became deeply unpopular as he moved into politics.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump has been indicted by a Manhattan grand jury, a historic reckoning after years of investigations into his personal, political and business dealings and an abrupt jolt to his bid to retake the White House next year. The exact nature of the charges was unclear Friday (March 31, 2023) because the indictment remained under seal, but they stem from payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign to silence claims of an extramarital sexual encounter. Prosecutors say they are working to coordinate Trump's surrender, which could happen early next week. They are not saying whether they intend to seek prison time in the event of a conviction, a development that wouldn't prevent Trump from assuming the presidency.", "source": {"uri": "drgnews.com",

The jury's decision could make Trump the first U.S. president, past or present, convicted of a crime, potentially affecting his 2024 presidential bid.\n\nNew York prosecutors and Donald Trump's lawyers make their closing arguments at his hush money trial on Tuesday in a final bid to influence the 12 jurors who decide whether he will become the first U.S. president past or present convicted of a crime.\n\nAfter six weeks of trial, prosecutors will argue on Tuesday that Trump, 77, illegally falsified business documents to cover up evidence of a payment that bought the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 presidential election. Trump's defense team will try to convince jurors he is not guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" the standard required by U.S. law. Trump denies Daniels' allegation of a sexual encounter in 2006 when he was married to his current wife Melania.\n\nTrump's legal team called two witnesses of their own, and the former president himself did not testify. Instead, they have tried to raise doubts about the credibility of prosecution witnesses, most notably Michael Cohen, who testified that as Trump's fixer he handled the payment to Daniels and that Trump approved the cover-up.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Trump's lawyers got Cohen to discuss his felony convictions and imprisonment, his history of lying and his lingering animosity for his former boss. Cohen also admitted to stealing from Trump's company. If found guilty, Trump faces up to four years in prison, although imprisonment is unlikely for a first-time felon convicted of such a crime.\n\nA conviction will not prevent Trump from trying to take back the White House from Democratic President Joe Biden as the Republican candidate in the Nov. 5 election, and it would not prevent him from taking office if he won. Opinion polls show the two candidates locked in a tight race. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, normally a misdemeanor under New York law.\n\nProsecutors in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office elevated those charges to felonies, saying Trump falsified those records to disguise what amounted to an illegal campaign contribution: the payment that bought Daniels' silence about the alleged 2006 sexual encounter at a time when Trump was already facing multiple accusations of sexual misconduct. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing. His lawyers have implied that the $130,000 payment for Daniels' silence was intended to spare Trump's family from embarrassment, not to protect his White House bid. Prosecutors will cite testimony to argue otherwise.\n\nTrump faces three other criminal prosecutions as well, but none is likely to go to trial before the election. Separate cases in Washington and Georgia accuse him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat, while another case in Florida charges him with mishandling classified information after he left office in 2021.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases and says they are an effort by Biden's Democratic allies to hobble his presidential bid.\n\n(This story has not been edited by

Catch up on key evidence and testimony from 6 weeks", "body": "Donald Trump's hush money trial is entering its seventh and potentially final week.\n\nJurors have heard from more than 20 witnesses as prosecutors tried to build the case that the former president falsified business records to conceal reimbursements to his former lawyer Michael Cohen, who paid porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000 in 2016 to keep her unflattering claims about the presidential candidate under wraps.\n\nTestimony has swung from seedy details about the alleged sexual encounter to accounting processes within the Trump organization.\n\nBoth the defense team and the prosecution will recap their cases during closing arguments for the jury Tuesday, and the case will be in the hands of 12 Manhattanites shortly after.\n\nHere is a look back at the trial as we enter the homestretch:\n\n'This is not a conversation': Read heated exchange between Judge Merchan, Robert Costello\n\nAt the heart of the case is former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen's $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. Cohen pleaded guilty violating campaign finance laws in 2018 in relation to the payment. Trump denies Daniels' claim they had sex in 2006 while he was married to Melania Trump.\n\nProsecutors have tried to to show Trump falsified business records in order to conceal that crime, which would constitute a felony.\n\nMuch of the testimony set the scene for how Trump's campaign dealt with negative stories. Trump allies became concerned about his standing with women after the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape recording him talking about grabbing women's genitals came out in 2016, and several people testified on the levers they could pull to address those concerns.\n\nWho is David Pecker? Former head of National Enquirer expected as first witness in Donald Trump's trial\n\nThis recording was teased in opening arguments and introduced through a witness, computer forensic analyst Douglas Daus. \"So, what do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump says in the conversation, allegedly referring to the hush money deal for former Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nMcDougal's hush money payment was issued by American Media Inc., parent company of the tabloid National Enquirer, and ultimately never repaid by Trump despite Cohen's promises.\n\nCohen also testified Trump knew about the hush money payment and praised Cohen once it was closed. \"Fantastic. Great job,\" Trump said, according to Cohen's testimony.\n\nDavid Pecker is the former CEO of the tabloid National Enquirer's parent company. He had been friendly with Trump since the 1980s, and met with Cohen and Trump in August of 2015.\n\nPecker testified that he promised to be \"eyes and ears\" because he knew the Trump Organization had a \"very small staff.\" Pecker said he promised that if he heard anything negative about Trump or anything about women selling stories, he would notify Michael Cohen, as he did over the last several years. Cohen would then have the stories killed, Pecker testified.\n\nIn addition to McDougal's life rights,, the tabloid paid $30,000 to silence a doorman at Trump Tower, Dino Sajudin, who was shopping a story that Trump fathered an extramarital child.\n\nThe \"Access Hollywood\" tape, in which Trump boasted about grabbing women without consent, was released by the Washington Post on Oct. 7, 2016. While jurors did not see the video, the transcript was entered into evidence.\n\nSeveral witnesses, including former Trump aide Hope Hicks, a lawyer who represented Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in their hush money deals, and Cohen discussed how damaging it was to Trump's campaign.\n\n\"\"It wasn't until 'Access Hollywood' that the interest sort of reached a crescendo,\" lawyer Keith Davidson testified about Stormy Daniels' story.\n\nHicks said the video eventually raised concern in the Trump campaign about his standing with women voters. \"Not in that moment, but certainly eventually that was something that was raised,\" Hicks said on the stand.\n\n\"(Trump) wanted me to reach out to all of my contacts in the media. We needed to put a spin on this. And the spin that he wanted put on it was that this is locker room talk,\" Cohen testified about the tape, \"and use that in order to get control over the story and to minimize its impact on him and his campaign.\"\n\n'What have we done?' Stormy Daniels' attorney thought hush money aided Trump in 2016 election\n\nDaniels' testimony included intimate details about the alleged sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 at a golf tournament in Lake Tahoe. She said the evening left her shaking, and that she didn't so no but, \"didn't say anything at all.\"\n\nTrump's defense lawyer Todd Blanche requested a mistrial after Daniels' testimony, saying portions of her testimony were \"dog whistle for rape,\" and could make the jury prejudicial against Trump.\n\nBut Merchan denied the motion, pointing out that Blanche had denied that Daniels' story was true at all in his opening statements.\n\n\"Your denial puts the jury in a position of having to choose who they believe,\" Merchan said at the time.\n\n'Oh my god': Stormy Daniels testifies on spanking Trump, his gold tweezers, and silky PJs\n\nIn key testimony for the prosecution, Cohen testified he met with Donald Trump and Allen Weisselberg and Trump approved the plan to repay Cohen for Stormy Daniels' hush money through a scheme that involved stretching out payments over 12 months in 2017.\n\nIn Trump's presence, Weisselberg said during the meeting that the money would be repaid as a monthly retainer for legal services, Cohen testified. A legal retainer is an agreement with a lawyer about compensation that reserves a lawyer or pays for future services.\n\nIn earlier testimony, Jeffrey McConney, the former controller at the Trump Organization, calculated how the $130,000 allegedly netted out to $35,000 monthly payments for Cohen's \"retainer.\" The $130,000 paid to Keith M Davidson Associates PLC, plus $50,000 paid for technology services, doubled to pay for taxes, plus a $60,000 bonus, equaled $420,000. At a monthly rate for one year, McConney testified, that came to $35,000. Tarasoff testified the check from Trump's personal account was signed by Trump. Cohen admitted to stealing from the Trump Organization by overstating the technology services costs he paid, as part of this repayment.\n\nWeisselberg said the money to Cohen was a monthly retainer even though the three men were actually discussing repaying Cohen for the hush money, as well as giving him a bonus and repaying him for a separate expense, according to Cohen's testimony.\n\n\"He approved it,\" Cohen told jurors, speaking about Trump.\n\nDid Cohen convince the jury? Michael Cohen's testimony in Trump hush money trial impressed experts, but suffered setbacks\n\nTrump's defense team called Republican lawyer Robert Costello as their second and last witness. After numerous objections from the prosecution were sustained, Costello appeared to get frustrated.\n\n'Jeez!' Costello said in the witness box, at a normal volume - but with an exasperated tone - after a sustained objection.\n\n\"Sorry? I'm sorry?\" Merchan said heatedly to Costello. Costello then said \"strike it,\" seeming to refer to striking his own testimony from the court record.\n\nCostello continued testifying, and then he dramatically sighed after another objection was sustained. Merchan then excused the jurors from the courtroom and said to Costello: \"I want to discuss proper decorum in my courtroom.\"\n\nCostello later testified on some statements Cohen made, particularly about how he previously told Costello he did not have any evidence against Trump when the FBI raided his home in 2018.\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType":

Prosecutors will then present their final statements alleging Trump falsified business documents to hide hush-money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 presidential election. Closing arguments are expected to take most of, if not all of Tuesday.\n\nOnce both the defense and prosecution have completed their closing arguments this week, Judge Juan Merchan will issue instructions to the jury of 12 New Yorkers as to what charges they can consider as they begin their deliberations.\n\nMerchan ruled last week that jurors do not have to agree on an alleged crime -- whether it's a tax crime, violations of state law or violations of federal election law -- that \"predicated\" the hush-money payment, despite defense protestations that jurors must agree in order to issue a felony conviction.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump blasted the judge in a post on Truth Social, claiming there is \"no case.\"\n\n\"The reason the radical, highly conflicted Judge Juan Merchan had to come up with three fake options for the jury to choose from, without requiring them to be unanimous, which is completely un-American and unconstitutional, is because the corrupt Soros-backed D.A., Alvin Bragg, couldn't come close to proving that any crime was committed,\" Trump wrote.\n\nOver the course of the five-week trial, the prosecution called 20 witnesses -- including Daniels and former Trump attorney Michael Cohen -- totaling more than 50 hours. Trump's defense team called two witnesses including a paralegal who entered phone records into evidence and Robert Costello, Cohen's former attorney.\n\nThe former president did not testify.\n\nLast week, Cohen testified he made a $130,000 payment to Daniels and also admitted he stole about $30,000 from the Trump Organization, saying he was angry Trump had shorted him on his bonus.\n\n\"I had protected Trump the best I could,\" Cohen said during his nine-hour testimony. \"And I also laid out money to RedFinch a year-and-a-half earlier, and again $130,000 payment to Daniels and to have my bonus cut by two-thirds was upsetting to say the least.\"\n\nCostello later testified that Cohen repeatedly told him Trump had no knowledge of any hush-money payments. At one point during his testimony, Merchan cleared the courtroom to admonish Costello.\n\n\"I want to discuss proper decorum in my courtroom,\" Merchan said last week. \"You don't give me a side eye and you don't roll your eyes. When there's a witness on the stand, if you don't like my ruling, you don't say, 'Jeez.' You don't say strike it.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Daniels testified under subpoena and described the alleged sexual encounter with Trump in a Lake Tahoe hotel room after meeting him at a celebrity golf tournament. Trump has denied the affair.\n\nDaniels testified that the initial non-disclosure agreement with Trump was canceled when she was not paid, adding that a new deal was reached. Daniels testified that after legal fees, she took home about $96,000.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Trump's attorney Susan Necheles questioned Daniels about owing $122,000 in legal fees to Trump for defamation following a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling last year. Daniels clarified she owes Trump about $560,000, saying she does not know if she will pay.\n\nDuring Daniels' testimony, the defense called for a mistrial and attempted to modify a gag order against Trump, arguing that Daniels' detailed testimony about the alleged sexual encounter was not relevant. Merchan denied both motions.\n\nWhile the jury is expected to get the case this week, there are three possible outcomes with no timetable for deliberations or a verdict: The jury could deadlock, forcing Merchan to declare a mistrial; the jury could find the prosecution did not make its case and acquit Trump; or the jury could convict the former president.\n\nIf convicted, Merchan could choose between sentencing Trump to probation or a sentence of up to four years on each count in state prison, with a maximum of 20 years.", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Charlotte Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sheri_walsh@charlotteobserver.com", "name": "Sheri Walsh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_instructions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury instructions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralegal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paralegal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-disclosure agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gag order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tahoe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lake Tahoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/fr3615/picture288786995/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/479a8860-59cd-4ebd-8064-7dbdc94d4507", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": -0.592156862745098, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Major week looms in Trump hush money trial", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- The testimony in Donald Trump's New York hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict.\n\nIt's impossible to say how long all of that will take, but in a landmark trial that's already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could easily be the most important.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nHere's what to expect in the days ahead:\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nStarting Tuesday morning, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments expected to last for much of the day, if not all of it.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election to a porn star who alleged she had a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nLook for prosecutors to remind jurors that they can trust the financial paperwork they've seen and the witnesses they've heard from. That includes porn actor Stormy Daniels, whose account of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump is at the heart of the case, and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme and authorized payments.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIt's worth remembering that the defense, which called only two witnesses but not Trump, doesn't have to prove anything or convince jurors of Trump's innocence.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nExpect the defense to try to poke holes in the government's case by disputing Daniels' testimony about her hotel suite encounter with Trump and by distancing Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements to Cohen, who was responsible for the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels.\n\nThe defense may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid.\n\nAnd it'll certainly attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand. How much of his testimony the jury believes will go a long way in determining the outcome of the case.\n\nSince the prosecution has the burden of proof, it will deliver its summation last -- the reverse order from opening statements, in which the prosecution went first.\n\nONE LAST THING BEFORE THE JURY DELIBERATES\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nA critical moment will take place, perhaps Wednesday morning, before the jury begins its deliberations.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nIn an indication of just how important those instructions are, prosecutors and defense lawyers had a spirited debate last week outside the jury's presence as they sought to persuade Merchan about the instructions he should give.\n\nThe Trump team, for instance, sought an instruction informing jurors that the types of hush money payments at issue in Trump's case are not inherently illegal, a request a prosecutor called \"totally inappropriate.\" Merchan said such an instruction would go too far and is unnecessary.\n\nTrump's team also asked Merchan to consider the \"extraordinarily important\" nature of the case when issuing his instructions and to urge jurors to reach \"very specific findings.\" Prosecutors objected to that as well, and Merchan agreed that it would be wrong to deviate from the standard instructions.\n\n\"When you say it's a very important case, you're asking me to change the law, and I'm not going to do that,\" Merchan said.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, requested an instruction that someone's status as a candidate doesn't need to be the sole motivation for making a payment that benefits the campaign. Defense lawyers asked for jurors to be told that if a payment would have been made even if the person wasn't running, it shouldn't be treated as a campaign contribution.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nONCE THE JURY GETS THE CASE\n\nThe deliberations will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that's intentionally opaque.\n\nJurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it's hard to read too much into the meaning of any note.\n\nIt's anyone's guess how long the jury will deliberate for and there's no time limit either. The jury must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records, so that could take some time, and a verdict might not come by the end of the week.\n\nTo reach a verdict, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it.\n\nThings will get trickier if the jury can't reach a consensus after several days of deliberations. Though defense lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial, Merchan is likely to call the jurors in and instruct them to keep trying for a verdict and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others.\n\nIf, after that instruction, the jury still can't reach a verdict, the judge would have the option to deem the panel hopelessly deadlocked and declare a mistrial.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jennifer Peltz, Michael R.

Here are all the possible outcomes of the Trump trial.", "body": "NEW YORK -- The first prosecution of a former president is nearing the end.\n\nThe 12 New Yorkers who will soon weigh the evidence in Donald Trump's Manhattan criminal trial could reach three different verdicts. All would require a unanimous decision.\n\nIf they can't agree, there's a fourth possible outcome: a hung jury. Plus, there's another result that, while extremely unlikely at this point, could end the case without the jury's input at all.\n\nClosing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday. Then, the judge will instruct the jury on the relevant law, and the jurors will begin their secret deliberations -- which could last anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks.\n\nHere are the 5 ways the Trump trial could conclude:\n\nTrump is charged with 34 counts of felony falsification of business records. Those records, prosecutors allege, were made in connection with a scheme to mask the true source of former Trump fixer Michael Cohen's $130,000 payment to silence porn star Stormy Daniels on the eve of the 2016 election and prevent her from going public with her claim that she had sex with Trump a decade earlier.\n\nFor the jurors to find Trump guilty of all 34 counts, they must find beyond a reasonable doubt not only that Trump falsified or caused the falsification of business records \"with intent to defraud\" but also that he did so with the intent to commit or conceal another crime. That second element -- the intent to commit or conceal another crime -- elevates the charges to felonies.\n\nProsecutors have offered three possible underlying crimes -- violations of state or federal election law and a tax crime -- but the jurors do not all have to agree on what that separate crime was, Justice Juan Merchan ruled.\n\nIn the case of conviction, Trump is all but certain to appeal the verdict.\n\nThough all 34 of the felony counts were brought in connection with the same general set of allegations, each of the counts concerns a separate business record. Those records include checks, check stubs and entries in the general ledger for the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust and Trump's personal account, both of which were used to reimburse Cohen for the $130,000 he initially laid out for the payment to Daniels.\n\nAnd some records are invoices from Cohen that the Trump Organization kept.\n\nIn theory, the jury could find that, say, Trump did falsify business records by cutting the checks from the trust and his personal account, but he doesn't bear responsibility for the invoices from Cohen.\n\nIn that scenario, the jury could convict Trump of some charges and acquit him of others. The 12 jurors would have to unanimously agree on the verdict for each of the counts.\n\nThere are a number of ways the jury could come to the decision that Trump is not guilty on all 34 counts: They could find that Trump didn't make false business records or cause others to make them; that he made them but not with the intent to defraud; or that he made them with the intent to defraud but not in service of committing or covering up an underlying crime.\n\nThe jury can't choose to convict Trump on the third option, though technically a misdemeanor crime in New York, because Trump's lawyers didn't request that the jury instructions include \"lesser included offenses,\" which would have allowed the jury to weigh misdemeanors.\n\nAgain, all 12 jurors would have to agree that Trump isn't guilty of any of the 34 charges for the jury to fully acquit him in any of these scenarios.\n\nA \"not guilty\" verdict would be final: Under the Constitution's bar on \"double jeopardy,\" prosecutors cannot appeal acquittals.\n\nThis is where things get dicey. If even a single juror cannot come to the same conclusion as the 11 others, Trump will get a hung jury.\n\nThis is far from unprecedented. Two years ago, a lone holdout juror who reportedly ranted about a \"government witch hunt\" during deliberations forced a mistrial in Manhattan federal court in the case of a businessman charged with fraud alongside Trump ally Steve Bannon. (The defendant, however, was later convicted for his role in a fraudulent fundraising scheme.)\n\nAnd in 2012, in the prosecution of former Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.) -- a case with passing similarities to the Trump case -- the jury hung on fivecounts of campaign finance fraud and conspiracy.\n\nIf the jury seems as though they have reached an impasse during deliberations, the jurors will likely inform the judge of their predicament. Merchan would then likely give them a set of instructions called an \"Allen\" charge, which asks them to go back and deliberate further to try to reach a uniform conclusion.\n\nIf they say they still can't reach a unanimous verdict, Merchan would declare a mistrial. In theory, the jury could hang on some charges, but reach a verdict on others.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office could choose to retry the case, but given the resources required to hold a criminal trial of a former president -- and the possibility Trump could be president-elect by November -- it's not clear they would do so.\n\nIt's unlikely, but still possible, that the judge could remove the jury from the equation entirely.\n\nMerchan could take the decision out of the jury's hands by issuing a \"directed verdict\" for acquittal -- in essence, a determination by the judge that no reasonable jury could find that the prosecution has proved its case. Such verdicts are more commonly issued immediately after the prosecution rests. But it's still an option that Merchan could take, even after the trial ends.\n\nTrump's lead defense lawyer, Todd Blanche, asked Merchan to dismiss the case last week, citing insufficient evidence. Blanche's motion remains pending.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Bannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_included_offense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lesser included offense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President-elect_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President-elect of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_jeopardy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double jeopardy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_instructions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury instructions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Edwards", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verdict", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Verdict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bar association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Witch-hunt"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

That's unavoidable. It's your job at closing to weave it all together, and to make it make sense. And so that will be especially the case here because this is a long trial,\" said CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor.\n\n\"This, more than even your typical case, is going to be a closing case,\" he added.\n\nFormer New York prosecutor Bernarda Villalona said prosecutors will use their closing arguments \"to tell the story from the very beginning.\" She said that unlike their opening statement, which lasted about 40 minutes, prosecutors' final remarks in the case could go on for several hours and feature a visual aid like a PowerPoint presentation to help walk the jury back through some of the key evidence.\n\n\"The boring is over. The boring part was having them sit down to hear it,\" added Villalona, referring to the 12 jurors. \"Interestingly enough, the boring part is actually the most important part of the case because the boring part is what gives you the documents. The star witness in this case are the documents, and the documents speak for themselves.\"\n\nTrump's attorneys will present their closing arguments first on Tuesday, followed by the arguments from prosecutors. Trump's legal team is expected to focus on the credibility of former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, the only prosecution witness to directly tie the former president to the coverup payments, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche will argue that there was no crime and that business documents were not falsified since Cohen was Trump's attorney and continued to work for him into 2017, the people said.\n\nThe former president's legal team will also dispute this was part of a conspiracy to influence the election. They will steer clear of any arguments about political motivations for bringing this case, but might mention the case is old and let jurors draw their own conclusions.\n\nWhile the lawyers have no time limit, Trump's legal team thinks three hours is the maximum time a jury wants to listen to a closing argument, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Their timing posture is also part of a strategy to discourage prosecutor Joshua Steinglass from continuing his closing argument into Wednesday morning.\n\nEssentially, Trump's lawyers do not want the lead prosecutor to have another crack at the jury before they retire to deliberate.\n\nEssentially, Trump's lawyers do not want the lead prosecutor to have another crack at the jury before they retire to deliberate.\n\nOnce both sides finish their arguments, Judge Juan Merchan will instruct the jury as to the charges it must consider against the former president; then, the jurors will begin their deliberations. The judge has said he expects this to happen on Wednesday.\n\nThe closing arguments will begin exactly a week after the defense rested its case on Tuesday and more than five weeks after opening statements were delivered and the first witness, former tabloid executive David Pecker, took the stand.\n\nThe prosecution called 20 witnesses over 19 days in court, with their testimony totaling over 50 hours. Many of their witnesses were not household names, though some, including Cohen and adult film actress Stormy Daniels -- whose alleged affair with Trump is at the center of the case -- were high-profile figures whose testimony is no doubt seared into jurors' minds. (Trump has denied the alleged affair.)\n\nFor its part, Trump's team called just two witnesses: a paralegal who entered phone records into evidence and Robert Costello, an attorney who was in talks with Cohen to represent him in 2018.\n\nTrump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree to cover up the reimbursement of hush money payments made before the 2016 election to Daniels. If convicted, Merchan could sentence Trump to probation or a sentence of 1 1/3 to 4 years on each count in state prison, with a maximum of 20 years.\n\nBlanche is expected to highlight that prosecutors didn't call former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg, who is the only other person in the Trump Tower meeting in 2017 where Cohen said Trump approved the reimbursement plan and monthly check payments; Dylan Howard, a former top editor of the National Enquirer who was involved in all three of the \"catch and kill\" deals; nor Keith Schiller, a former bodyguard to Trump, the people said.\n\nWhat prosecutors might argue\n\nProsecutors will likely contend during their closing arguments that each of their witnesses plays a key role in the case, despite their professional rank or proximity to the alleged crimes. They will probably also have to push back against claims by the defense that Cohen, prosecutors' star witness, undermines their case because of his history of dishonesty, Honig said.\n\n\"The prosecution's argument will be that all the evidence interlocks and is corroborated and that you don't have to rely on any one witness's word on its own. They will say this is a documents case,\" he explained, going on to describe the various accounting documents presented during the trial.\n\n\"And they'll say, 'Michael Cohen's here to guide you through it, but you don't need to believe him -- everything he says is backed up'\" by evidence and other testimony, Honig said.\n\nJoshua Steinglass, who is doing closings for the prosecution, is expected to address the jury for several hours following the defense's presentation. He is expected to tie together text messages, phone logs, other witnesses' testimony and the 34 allegedly falsified documents to corroborate Cohen's testimony.\n\nDuring the trial, prosecutors walked jurors repeatedly through the 11 invoices, 12 vouchers and 11 checks -- the 34 documents that make up the falsified business records charges -- that were used to pay Cohen $420,000 in 2017, money that included the reimbursement for the $130,000 hush money payment \"grossed up\" to account for taxes.\n\nProsecutors showed jurors how Cohen sent the Trump Organization monthly invoices for $35,000, which were processed by the Trump company's controller so checks could be cut. Trump signed nine of the 11 checks. (The other two checks were paid from Trump's revocable trust and signed by former Trump Org. Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg and one of Trump's sons.)\n\nKaren Friedman Agnifilo, who served for a time as a top prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, said she expects the prosecution to present several themes in their closing arguments, including that most of the people who testified for their case were \"Trump witnesses ... who you would expect to be friendly to him.\"\n\nThe other theme, she said, could be: \"Look at the kind of people Trump values,\" with prosecutors arguing the former president chose to surround himself with people such as Cohen and Pecker, who were doing Trump's bidding ahead of the 2016 election.\n\n\"These are his people, he chose them. And he shouldn't now get the benefit of, 'Because they're flawed you can't rely on them,'\" prosecutors might argue, Agnifilo said.\n\n\"And even if you do not rely on them,\" she said, echoing Honig, \"the third theme is going to be, 'You don't have to, because everything is corroborated either by other witnesses or documents or records or Trump's own words.'\"\n\nThe length of the trial may not ultimately prove to be much of a challenge for jurors during their deliberations, Villalona said, since they were allowed to jot down notes during the proceedings and will be able to request some parts of the trial be read back to them.\n\n\"The good thing about New York is that they could request to have the whole trial read back to them and the judge will do that,\" she said. \"So if they forgot something David Pecker said on Day 1 or 2 of the trial, they can have that read back.\" She added that any of the exhibits put into evidence could also be sent to the jurors for them to take a closer look as they mull a verdict.\n\nStill, the closing arguments from each side will be carefully crafted to win not only a verdict in their favor, but also to mark each attorneys' place in the historic trial, Villalona mused.\n\n\"The prosecution and the defense is going to give the closing argument of their career,\" she said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN's Jeremy Herb, Kara Scannell and Lauren del Valle contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg and one of Trump's sons.)\n\nKaren Friedman Agnifilo, who served for a time as a top prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, said she expects the prosecution to present several themes in their closing arguments, including that most of the people who testified for their case were \"Trump witnesses ... who you would expect to be friendly to him.\"\n\nThe other theme, she said, could be: \"Look at the kind of people Trump values,\" with prosecutors arguing the former president chose to surround himself with people such as Cohen and Pecker, who were doing Trump's bidding ahead of the 2016 election.\n\n\"These are his people, he chose them. And he shouldn't now get the benefit of, 'Because they're flawed you can't rely on them,'\" prosecutors might argue, Agnifilo said.\n\n\"And even if you do not rely on them,\" she said, echoing Honig, \"the third theme is going to be, 'You don't have to, because everything is corroborated either by other witnesses or documents or records or Trump's own words.'\"\n\nThe length of the trial may not ultimately prove to be much of a challenge for jurors during their deliberations, Villalona said, since they were allowed to jot down notes during the proceedings and will be able to request some parts of the trial be read back to them.\n\n\"The good thing about New York is that they could request to have the whole trial read back to them and the judge will do that,\" she said. \"So if they forgot something David Pecker said on Day 1 or 2 of the trial, they can have that read back.\" She added that any of the exhibits put into evidence could also be sent to the jurors for them to take a closer look as they mull a verdict.\n\nStill, the closing arguments from each side will be carefully crafted to win not only a verdict in their favor, but also to mark each attorneys' place in the historic trial, Villalona mused.\n\n\"The prosecution and the defense is going to give the closing argument of their career,\" she said.\n\nCNN's Jeremy Herb, Kara Scannell and Lauren del Valle contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

After hearing from 22 witnesses -- 20 from the prosecution and two from the defense -- a 12-member jury is on the verge of deliberations. But not before both sides present their dueling narratives for the jury's consideration.\n\nAfter hearing the closing arguments from both sides, the jury will decide whether Trump is guilty of any of the 34 charges contained in the indictment brought by District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg. Prosecutors allege that Trump falsified invoices and business ledgers and issued checks under false pretenses to reimburse his former attorney Michael Cohen. They must also show that Trump did so to conceal some other crime. Prosecutors have not been clear as to what that \"other crime\" might be, but have alluded to a campaign finance violation.\n\nIn doing so, prosecutors say that Trump engaged in a conspiracy and cover-up to pay off Stormy Daniels in order to conceal his alleged liaison with the adult film actress, who received $130,000 to keep quiet. His motive, prosecutors claim, was to hide this information from voters to increase the likelihood that he'd be elected in 2016. If the jury agrees, Trump would become a convicted felon, and could face up to four years in prison. Although there are multiple counts, any potential jail time would run concurrent for each count, meaning the four years represents his total exposure.\n\nBut Trump's defense attorneys will have much to say Tuesday about the evidence presented by prosecutors in an attempt to avoid that outcome. There are two ways for Trump to prevail: First, the jury could acquit him based upon the presence of reasonable doubt that he committed the alleged crimes. Second, there could be a mistrial if one or more jurors refuse to convict. This would result in a new trial for Trump before a new jury.\n\nShould that happen, Trump would essentially be exonerated. Here's why: There would be insufficient time to try him again before the November election. And if he wins the election, prosecutors would almost certainly put the trial on hold until after his presidency in keeping with guidance from the Department of Justice, which forbids trying a sitting president. If he loses the election, it would be hard to imagine that there would be much interest in trying him again. What would be the point?\n\nThe defense will present its closing argument first. Since prosecutors have the burden of proof, they will have the last word. Neither side will be entitled to rebut the other once they sit down.\n\nDrawing from my experience in the courtroom, here's what I predict you will hear from both sides.\n\nThe defense will likely maximize the importance of Trump's former fixer, Cohen, in this scheme. In doing so, they will argue that the entirety of the case is built upon Cohen's word. And since he has zero credibility because of his documented lies, they will say, all charges must fail. Prosecutors, however, will minimize the significance of Cohen, noting that virtually all other witness testimony -- along with emails, text messages, audio recordings and other documents -- supports Cohen's claims.\n\nThe defense will assert that Trump did nothing illegal. They will no doubt highlight the fact that catching unfavorable media stories and killing them (buying rights to the stories and then stopping their publication) is an accepted and legal practice, as is the signing of non-disclosure agreements. It's also not illegal to desire to win an election or to protect your family or yourself from the revelations of embarrassing information.\n\nAs for Daniels, the defense will contest the affair (which Trump has consistently denied), while pressing the claim that Cohen went rogue and acted on his own accord in making the payoff deal. They will argue that he did so without Trump's knowledge or consent. And while the details she gave about their alleged encounter may have been salacious and entertaining, even if the jury believes it happened, a dalliance is not illegal.\n\nRegarding the payment of invoices or reimbursing Cohen for the expenses he incurred, again, this is not in itself illegal. Yes, Trump wrote out checks, which is perfectly appropriate, whether with a Sharpie pen or otherwise.\n\nAs to ledgers and invoices keeping track of these checks, Trump is the owner of the organization, not the bookkeeper or finance person. He has nothing to do with ledgers or invoices. And, by the way, he was pretty busy running the free world back in 2017, having little time to micromanage or even care about business records. None of Trump's financial people testified to Trump directing them to falsify anything.\n\nThe defense will remind the jury that the only witness who directly implicates Trump is Cohen. And they will have a field day pointing out that he is a Trump-hating disbarred lawyer and convicted felon, who lied to Congress, lied to banks, lied to business associates and even hid information from his own wife. The thousands of dollars he stole from the Trump Organization will certainly be mentioned, along with the millions he made for bashing Trump.\n\nIn short, the defense will argue that the credibility-challenged Cohen desperately wants to see Trump convicted, and has a vendetta against him for not offering him a job in the White House.\n\nThe defense will certainly highlight what they will style as the biggest lie of all: Cohen's testimony in which he claims that he briefed Trump and obtained approval for the Daniels deal during a 96-second phone call he made to Trump's bodyguard. Cohen claims Trump was with the bodyguard at the time, and that he handed Trump the phone. When it was pointed out that in the lead-up to that call Cohen had sent numerous text messages to the bodyguard about being harassed by a 14-year-old, with no mention of Daniels at all, Cohen seemed to be caught off-guard.\n\nFinally, the defense will reinforce that you cannot convict someone because you don't like their politics -- that would be anathema to our entire system of justice. And, by the way, how about the mysterious other crime that Trump was concealing? Why didn't the prosecution spend more time on that? Not guilty.\n\nBut not so fast, prosecutors will say.\n\nWe told you that this case was about a conspiracy and a cover-up, and that's exactly what we've proven, the prosecution will argue.\n\nThe defense would have you believe that this case hinges entirely on Cohen's word. It does not. Virtually every witness came in here and corroborated just about everything he said.\n\nHis motivation for doing so was obvious. Given the release of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, in which Trump bragged on a hot mic about committing sexual assault, he could ill afford to be embroiled in yet another scandal. You heard the communications director of his campaign, Hope Hicks, speak to the dire issues the campaign was confronting and how they were in full damage control after the tape was released. You also heard from her that Trump is a micromanager who knew exactly what was going on around him at all times. She also told you that Cohen is simply not the type of person to front money based upon the kindness of his heart.\n\nAnd, by the way, we know that Trump was fully aware of another deal -- the agreement with Playboy model Karen McDougal. We all heard the tape of Trump and Cohen plotting to pay her off so that she would not reveal their affair. How likely is it that Trump would be fully involved and engaged when it comes to that agreement, but be completely clueless about the payoff to Daniels? Not very. McDougal and Daniels even had the same lawyer negotiating the payments, Keith Davidson.\n\nYet, amazingly, the defense wants you to believe that the only direct evidence regarding Trump's involvement in this fraud is Cohen. Nonsense. And by the way, did we all not hear the audio of Cohen speaking to Davidson in which he talks about Trump lamenting the payment to Daniels even though Cohen says that everyone else told Trump it was the right thing to do?\n\nAnd think about what else proves Trump's awareness of this deal -- his annoyance with having to make it in the first place. According to Cohen, Trump made every effort to slow roll the payment to Daniels, asking him to delay it until after the election, saying: \"If I win, it will have no relevance because I'll be president, and if I lose no one will care.\"\n\nThen there's Cohen's meeting with Trump at the White House, directly before the reimbursement payments began. We know the meeting was not to discuss a Cohen appointment to be attorney general of the United States. And immediately following this meeting, Trump started sending Cohen \"retainer\" payments in his signature Sharpie pen. Interestingly, though, Cohen wasn't doing any legal work on Trump's behalf.\n\nThe evidence shows that in order for checks to be issued to Cohen, Trump would have had to give his approval. And the reason they were framed and structured as they were was to avoid detection for what their real purpose was -- reimbursement to Cohen, along with a bonus for a job well done. And if everything was so innocent, why send the unsigned checks to Trump's head of security via FedEx so they could be carried into the White House, signed by him and FedEx'd back? Seems like a rather elaborate arrangement to merely pay a lawyer for \"retainer\" fees.\n\nThe defense would have you believe that the man who wrote \"The Art of the Deal\" had no clue what the $35,000 monthly checks to Cohen were actually for, or if he even knew he was signing them at all, because he was so busy multitasking. How plausible is that? Not only did he know exactly what he was doing, but he knew exactly how the books would have to be manipulated to avoid questions of illegality, the prosecution will no doubt say.\n\nIn directing that the books be structured in a certain way, Trump was involved in the conspiracy concerning fraudulent ledgers and invoices -- whether he personally prepared them or not is immaterial. One thing he did personally sign was the checks themselves. What better speaks to personal involvement than his signature?\n\nAnd why did he engage in this conspiracy and cover-up? To circumvent campaign finance laws during a presidential election. Do we need Cohen to tell us that -- or is that what our common sense and good judgment tell us? You can also trust the cell phone records, text messages, emails, audio you heard and other documents. Trump's guilt on all counts is undeniable.\n\nThe defense spent a significant amount of their time and energy undermining Cohen, who claims he talked with Trump about the Daniels scheme \"more than 20 times\" in October 2016. If jurors discount Cohen's testimony, there could be a problem for prosecutors as he provides the direct link to Trump's guilt. Alternatively, if prosecutors are successful in downplaying Cohen's significance, and focusing on all the other evidence showing Trump would not only be aware of the Daniels deal but establishing motive and reason to ensure the agreement got done, prosecutors could prevail. Why? Because that would make Trump's involvement in falsifying records obvious -- as would be his motivation to do so.\n\nWhat will the ultimate verdict be? The jury will decide. In making that decision, they have an awful lot to consider.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

This is each side's opportunity to summarize what they've presented at trial over the last several weeks and their last chance to convince jurors that they've proved their case.\n\nExpect prosecutors to remind jurors of the testimony from the 18 witnesses they called, all of whom filled in the picture of how, in a scheme arranged by the now-disbarred attorney Michael Cohen just days before the 2016 election, Trump allegedly covered up a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels, who said she'd had an extramarital affair with Trump in 2006.\n\nAt the heart of the case is a series of monthly checks, invoices and other financial statements from 2017 that, according to prosecutors and Cohen's testimony, indicate Trump was repaying Cohen for the $130,000 hush money payment he handled. Those documents, which were labeled as payment for Cohen's legal services, represent the business documents Trump is accused of falsifying.\n\nOther highlights from the prosecution included testimony from David Pecker, former CEO of the National Enquirer's publisher, who said he had an agreement with Trump to publish flattering stories about the then-candidate, to run unflattering articles about his political opponents and to help block the publication of stories that could damage Trump's reputation.\n\nAnd despite the defense team's suggestion that Trump was unaware of the repayments, prosecutors argued, the former president emphasized in his various books that it's crucial for a businessman to closely oversee every dollar spent.\n\nExpect Trump's lawyers to focus their closing arguments on discrediting the prosecutions' top witnesses, namely Cohen and Daniels.\n\nThe former cannot be trusted because he is a convicted felon, they argued at trial, and he admitted to lying on behalf of Trump and lying to Congress.\n\nDaniels has had minor inconsistencies in stories she's told about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump over the years, the defense argued, and emphasized that Daniels has profited off her story, including by publishing a memoir in 2018.\n\nHush money payments are not inherently illegal, the defense stated throughout trial, and the Manhattan district attorney's office should never have brought this case forward.\n\nThe 12 jurors could then head into deliberations as early as Wednesday.

While Trump faces a New York jury, Daniels endures relentless judgment and abuse, which she fears will intensify as Trump campaigns for the White House again.\n\n\"Back in 2018, there was stuff like 'liar,' 'slut,' 'gold digger.' This time around, it's different. It is direct threats. It is 'I'm going to come to your house to slit your throat,\" she was quoted as saying by The Mirror. The abuse and violent threats against Stormy Daniels intensified after the decision to charge Donald Trump over alleged hush money payments made to her. Anger over her role in Trump's potential downfall has led some to believe their actions are justified.\n\n\"They're not even using bot accounts, they're using their real accounts,\" she says. \"I compare them to suicide bombers. They legitimately think that what they're doing is right. Those people who see me as a villain. \"It just makes me scratch my head and really question how they would want their daughters treated, or their sisters, or their mother.\"\n\nThe arguments in the Hush money trial, expected to last the entire day, will give the attorneys one last chance to address the Manhattan jury hearing the landmark case. After more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys will aim to create doubts about the strength of evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and who served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\nAfter the closing arguments are given, the judge will instruct the jury, likely Wednesday, on the law governing the case and the factors it can take into account during deliberations. The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite.

They are expected to last all day Tuesday and could extend into the next day. After Judge Juan Merchan explains the law to jurors, Trump and the rest of the country will be held in suspense to see if he becomes the first ex-president and presumptive Republican Party nominee to be convicted of a crime after allegedly falsified financial records to hide. a hush money payment to an adult film star in 2016.\n\nThe verdict will have repercussions far beyond the courtroom and Trump's personal life as the case is now intertwined with his bid to win back the White House. The stakes are particularly high as this will likely be the only one of four ongoing criminal trials expected to go to a jury before the November election. The former president appeared in a sour mood on the eve of his return to the courtroom, lashing out at opponents he called Human Scum in a Memorial Day social media post .\n\nTrump's defense team is trying to spare their client the ignominy of a conviction that would tarnish his reputation. The ex-president's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, is expected to focus on the credibility of former fixer-turned-Trump nemesis Michael Cohen, who faced bruising cross-examination, and ask why other figures The ex-president's key business and personal matters have not been called by prosecutors, CNN's Kara Scannell reported.\n\nJoshua Steinglass, who is leading the prosecution's closing arguments, will follow Blanche and is expected to spend several hours presenting the jury with text messages, phone records, testimony from other witnesses and the 34 allegedly falsified documents to corroborate Cohen's testimony . Ultimately, the team working for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, will try to convince seven male and five female jurors that Trump orchestrated a scheme to hide unflattering information from voters in what was an early example of election interference.\n\nTrump has denied having an affair with Stormy Daniels and has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers don't need to convince all the jurors that he is innocent; they only need one juror to object to the unanimous guilty verdict required to convict him. Their conduct of the trial, during which they produced only two witnesses for a brief defense, indicates that they will argue that the State of New York failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the ex-president ordered and executed a plan which, in any case, they say, does not amount to breaking the law. They argued during the trial that there was no evidence of criminal intent. And they will seek to leave jurors with a devastating final image of Cohen, who admitted on the stand that he was a liar and benefited financially from a growing media empire targeting his ex-boss.\n\nWhile that's a big difference from a hung jury that could force the judge to declare a mistrial, leaving prosecutors open to retry Trump, any outcome that doesn't result in a conviction could serve Trump's political goals, at least for now.\n\nI don't know if voters see much difference between the two. For many, including the accused, the only relevant question is whether or not he is a convicted felon, said CNN legal analyst Elliot Williams. So I guess the defense is just hoping to plant a seed in the head of that juror who has enough doubts about the case and might be stubborn enough not to back down.\n\nBlanche argued earlier in the month that Cohen was so conflicted as a witness that the case shouldn't even go to the jury. He told the judge: He testified. And he lied under oath. In this courtroom. And the consequences of that lie, if accepted by the jury, are potentially a conviction.\n\nClosing arguments are the stage in a case where attorneys summarize weeks of complex testimony and courtroom theater and sketch out a narrative designed to shape deliberations over the evidence in the jury room. They are also used to impress upon jurors the enormous stakes in a trial, both the grave reality that a person's reputation and even liberty are at stake and the importance of upholding the rule of law .\n\nThe jury in this case must work through a complex legal equation at the heart of the case. To reach a guilty verdict, they must agree that New York state prosecutors have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified business records, which is normally a misdemeanor in the state . Then, to convict Trump of a crime, the jury must determine that this was done to commit another crime in this case in connection with the 2016 election.\n\nThe prosecution will likely argue that even though the defense mishandled Cohen, he told the truth about key elements of the case and that his testimony was corroborated in advance by weeks of evidence.\n\nFormer Manhattan prosecutor Jeremy Saland told CNN This Morning on Sunday that it's not important how jurors generally view Cohen as a person. Whether you like Michael Cohen, want him to date your sister, want him to be your brother-in-law, you don't have to like the guy. This is not a sympathy contest. (Was he) truthful at that time? Was he honest and credible?\n\nIn a few days of evidence, the prosecution built a legal edifice brick by brick ahead of the attacks on Cohen's credibility, which everyone knew were coming since the man who described himself as Trump's former thug was imprisoned for crimes including lying to Congress. .\n\nThere have been weeks and weeks of testimony from witnesses who have testified and whose testimony has been corroborated by emails, bank statements, contemporaneous phone calls, text messages and other documents of a conspiracy, argued prosecutor Matthew Colangelo in court.\n\nThis evidence was intended to create a scenario highlighting Trump's alleged affair with Daniels, in explicit and detailed terms, in order to explain to jurors why he might have wanted to cover it up. They obtained testimony from former tabloid editor David Pecker to highlight Trump's habit of shutting down embarrassing stories, and they produced evidence from former Trump associates, including the former communications director of White House Hope Hicks, to counter the idea that Trump was simply trying to hide his embarrassment. about Daniels from his family and was rather worried about voters forming an unfavorable impression of him in 2016.\n\nProsecutors also sketched a paper trail suggesting that Cohen was acting on the ex-president's orders in making a $130,000 payment to Daniels and that Trump was involved in falsifying financial accounts while president to cover up a refund to his former fixer.\n\nTuesday's closing arguments will create another personal test for Trump, whose attacks on witnesses have already led Merchan to warn that he could be jailed for further violations of a partial silence order. While staying just inside Merchan's red line, Trump continued to launch daily rhetorical attacks against the judge, prosecutors and the Justice Department, as well as false claims that the trial was part of a global plot by President Joe Biden to destroy him before Election Day. .\n\nTrump has expressed doubts that the 12 New Yorkers who will try him in the city where he made his name will give him a fair trial. And he was helped by a parade of Republican supporters, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, who showed up to support Trump's assault on the justice system. Trump's belligerence would be unbelievable from any defendant, much less one seeking to resume his role as titular leader and ultimate defender of the Constitution as the 47th president.\n\nJust over five months after the election, it is unclear if and how public opinion, already polarized around Trump, will change when the verdict is announced. The trial did not capture the national attention it might have if television cameras were allowed in the courtroom. And Trump used his multiple criminal charges to his political advantage by eliminating the field of Republican nominations. But some polls suggest a conviction could weigh against him in a close election with Biden. Past behavior also suggests that Trump would use any acquittal or mistrial brought about by a hung jury to seek justice in all of his criminal cases and to fuel the personal and political revenge campaign around which he has promised to build a second presidency .\n\nClosing arguments will continue after an unusual weeklong hiatus in the trial, which occurred because Merchan wanted to avoid having closing arguments and jury instructions interrupted by the Memorial Day holiday. The leave only appears to have intensified Trump's fury as he enters one of the defining weeks of his life.\n\nHappy Memorial Day to everyone, including the human scum who are working so hard to destroy our once great country, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social network that was particularly shocking on a day dedicated to members of the military fallen in battle. Trump railed against judges who presided over a massive fraud judgment against him, his company and his adult sons worth nearly half a billion dollars, as well as a defamation suit in which he was ordered to pay $83.3 million to writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nTrump concluded his tirade with these words: Now for Merchan!\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN_This_Morning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN This Morning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention_(criminal_law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intention (criminal law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pecker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Pecker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Jean_Carroll", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "E.

After more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments Tuesday.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they won't be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence -- and there were many. Judge Juan M. Merchan, for instance, fined Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases Trump is confronting as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of former President Donald Trump at https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Trump denies Daniels' allegation of a sexual encounter in 2006 when he was married to his current wife Melania.\n\nTrump's legal team called two witnesses of their own, and the former president himself did not testify.\n\nInstead, they have tried to raise doubts about the credibility of prosecution witnesses, most notably Michael Cohen, who testified that as Trump's fixer he handled the payment to Daniels and that Trump approved the cover-up.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Trump's lawyers got Cohen to discuss his felony convictions and imprisonment, his history of lying and his lingering animosity for his former boss. Cohen also admitted to stealing from Trump's company.\n\nIf found guilty, Trump faces up to four years in prison, although imprisonment is unlikely for a first-time felon convicted of such a crime.\n\nA conviction will not prevent Trump from trying to take back the White House from Democratic President Joe Biden as the Republican candidate in the Nov. 5 election, and it would not prevent him from taking office if he won. Opinion polls show the two candidates locked in a tight race.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, normally a misdemeanor under New York law.\n\nProsecutors in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office elevated those charges to felonies, saying Trump falsified those records to disguise what amounted to an illegal campaign contribution: the payment that bought Daniels' silence about the alleged 2006 sexual encounter at a time when Trump was already facing multiple accusations of sexual misconduct.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing. His lawyers have implied that the $130,000 payment for Daniels' silence was intended to spare Trump's family from embarrassment, not to protect his White House bid. Prosecutors will cite testimony to argue otherwise.\n\nTrump faces three other criminal prosecutions as well, but none is likely to go to trial before the election.\n\nSeparate cases in Washington and Georgia accuse him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat, while another case in Florida charges him with mishandling classified information after he left office in 2021.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases and says they are an effort by Biden's Democratic allies to hobble his presidential bid.\n\n(Reporting by Andy Sullivan; Editing by Howard Goller)",

Twelve Manhattan residents will then be tasked with rendering the first criminal verdict on the conduct of a former president in United States history.\n\nThe arguments - also referred to as \"summations\" - allow the two sides to bring together the vast amount of testimony and evidence jurors have taken in over five weeks. Prosecutors will argue that the evidence establishes beyond any reasonable doubt that Trump falsified business records in order to conceal or commit another crime, while the defense team will say it comes up short.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's live updates from inside and outside the Manhattan courtroom:\n\nFormer President Donald Trump posted a series of messages Monday, on the eve of closing arguments in his New York hush money trial, railing against the case as election interference and quoting scripture.\n\nBesides criticizing Judge Juan Merchan and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Trump questioned why the prosecution gets the final word before jury deliberations. Typically in summing up the evidence in a case, prosecutors make their statements, defense lawyers speak and prosecutors get a final rebuttal because they have the burden of proving their case.\n\n\"Big advantage, very unfair,\" Trump said in an all-caps post on Truth Social.\n\nTrump also quoted a passage from the book of John in the Bible about personal sacrifice. Trump and his supporters have described his four criminal cases as political persecution.\n\n\"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,\" the post said.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nEach count against Trump carries a maximum penalty of four years in prison and no minimum amount of jail or prison time. If Trump is convicted on all counts, Merchan will be tasked with deciding on a sentence for each count, and also deciding whether the sentences will coincide with each other or be run one after the other. However, New York law caps sentences for Class E felonies such as those Trump is charged with at 20 years.\n\nLegal experts told USA TODAY it's possible Trump could get just probation, even if he were convicted on every count. Most predicted any incarceration sentence on each count would run simultaneously with the others, so Trump wouldn't be ordered to serve more than four years behind bars. Experts also said Trump would likely be free while his expected appeal ran its course.\n\n- Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in order to conceal or commit another crime. The records - including checks, vouchers, and invoices - all relate to payments to former Trump lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen in 2017. Prosecutors say the payments were reimbursing Cohen for $130,000 in hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016, but the records were falsified to make the payments look like 2017 legal expenses.\n\nProsecutors say Trump was covering up the violation of federal campaign finance laws through the hush money, which was handed over less than two weeks before the 2016 presidential election. They also say Trump was trying to hide a plan to violate New York tax and election laws.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty, and Trump defense lawyer Todd Blanche has denied the payments were reimbursing the hush money.\n\n- Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge Juan Merchan may issue a ruling today on Trump's request to toss out the entire case ahead of jury deliberations.\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche told Merchan that prosecutors haven't put on enough evidence for the case to go to the jury because the business records at issue weren't false. He said documents show Trump was paying Michael Cohen for ongoing legal services in 2017. Blanche also said the prosecution's case shouldn't be able to stand given Cohen's history of lying, including - according to the Trump defense lawyer - during this trial.\n\n- Aysha Bagchi", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deliberation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incarceration in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

The jurors, who are expected to get the case as soon as Wednesday, could reach a verdict in a matter of days.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 payment to an adult film star on the eve of the 2016 election to keep her quiet about an alleged affair. The case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg may hinge on whether jurors believe Trump had an intent to defraud as well as conceal other crimes, namely election law and tax violations.\n\nWhile the false-records charges are \"simple and easy to understand,\" turning those misdemeanors into felonies using New York election law along with other legal theories is more complicated, said Jennifer Rodgers, a former federal prosecutor.\n\nThe defense's closing argument will cast the issue as \"muddled, confusing, and full of reasonable doubt,\" Rodgers said, while prosecutors \"will want to cast their enhancement theory as easy to understand and well supported by overwhelming evidence.\"\n\n\"It will be a tale of two cases, for sure.\"\n\nThe case is one of four criminal prosecutions Trump is facing as he campaigns to return to the White House, including state and federal charges over his failed attempt to overturn the result of the 2020 election. The presumptive Republican nominee has denied wrongdoing in all the cases, claiming without evidence that they're part of a coordinated conspiracy against him by Democrats.\n\nThe defense and prosecution in the hush money trial rested their cases early last week, but Justice Juan Merchan delayed closing arguments so they would not be split from deliberations by the holiday weekend and previously scheduled days off.\n\nMerchan has said closing arguments are expected to last all day Tuesday and could bleed into Wednesday. The judge must also give jurors so-called charging instructions to explain the law and aid their deliberations. Merchan told jurors they'll start deliberating \"hopefully, at some point on Wednesday.\"\n\nClosing arguments are important for prosecutors because a small number of witnesses \"may have overshadowed the rest of the evidence,\" according to Rodgers. She said the government must \"reacquaint jurors with all of the evidence in the case, not just the unforgettable moments.\"\n\nProsecutors, who have the burden of proof, will argue that their case was overwhelmingly supported by multiple witnesses along with a trove of emails, text messages, business records and other pieces of evidence.\n\nBragg's team relied heavily on its star witness, former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who made the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels - the adult film actress - and was allegedly reimbursed by Trump in monthly installments throughout 2017.\n\nCohen gave jurors a first-hand account of every stage of the alleged hush money scheme, from its inception at a 2015 Trump Tower meeting to efforts to deceive the press and federal election regulators when news of the scheme leaked out three years later.\n\nMuch of Cohen's testimony was backed by other witnesses or documents. Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified he met with Trump and Cohen at Trump Tower in 2015 to discuss how he could use his tabloid to help Trump win the White House.\n\nHope Hicks, Trump's former campaign press secretary, testified about how the Daniels story was seen as an existential threat to Trump's campaign on the eve of the election. She said Trump was less bothered when the story eventually came out in 2018 because he'd already won, bolstering Bragg's charge that the payouts were intended to help Trump win the election.\n\nOne person who didn't testify was Trump, but his team, led by Todd Blanche, will seek to sow doubt in the mind of at least one juror. His closing argument will likely focus heavily on Cohen's credibility, which Blanche damaged during a withering cross-examination.\n\nBlanche will remind jurors of Cohen's well-documented perjury as well as testimony at the trial that the defense says turned out to be false.", "source": {"uri": "spokesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Spokesman Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pecker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Pecker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_meeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trump Tower meeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burden of proof (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hope Hicks"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence_Based_Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence Based Medicine", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://thumb.spokesman.com/fuonAo7wfj6e-l6k43x0RNEyi28=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2024/05/27/66550a769277e.hires.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments Tuesday.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they won't be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence -- and there were many.

Merchan, for instance, fined Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases Trump is confronting as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nWhere each Trump case stands Classified documents case Election interference Hush money scheme Georgia election indictment Civil cases Arizona election indictment\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN --\n\nClosing arguments will get under way Tuesday at Manhattan Supreme Court in former President Donald Trump's hush money trial. After hearing from 22 witnesses -- 20 from the prosecution and two from the defense -- a 12-member jury is on the verge of deliberations. But not before both sides present their dueling narratives for the jury's consideration.\n\nJoey Jackson\n\nJeremy Freeman/CNN\n\nAfter hearing the closing arguments from both sides, the jury will decide whether Trump is guilty of any of the 34 charges contained in the indictment brought by District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg. Prosecutors allege that Trump falsified invoices and business ledgers and issued checks under false pretenses to reimburse his former attorney Michael Cohen. They must also show that Trump did so to conceal some other crime. Prosecutors have not been clear as to what that \"other crime\" might be, but have alluded to a campaign finance violation.\n\nIn doing so, prosecutors say that Trump engaged in a conspiracy and cover-up to pay off Stormy Daniels in order to conceal his alleged liaison with the adult film actress, who received $130,000 to keep quiet. His motive, prosecutors claim, was to hide this information from voters to increase the likelihood that he'd be elected in 2016. If the jury agrees, Trump would become a convicted felon, and could face up to four years in prison. Although there are multiple counts, any potential jail time would run concurrent for each count, meaning the four years represents his total exposure.\n\nBut Trump's defense attorneys will have much to say Tuesday about the evidence presented by prosecutors in an attempt to avoid that outcome. There are two ways for Trump to prevail: First, the jury could acquit him based upon the presence of reasonable doubt that he committed the alleged crimes. Second, there could be a mistrial if one or more jurors refuse to convict. This would result in a new trial for Trump before a new jury.\n\nShould that happen, Trump would essentially be exonerated. Here's why: There would be insufficient time to try him again before the November election. And if he wins the election, prosecutors would almost certainly put the trial on hold until after his presidency in keeping with guidance from the Department of Justice, which forbids trying a sitting president. If he loses the election, it would be hard to imagine that there would be much interest in trying him again. What would be the point?\n\nThe defense will present its closing argument first. Since prosecutors have the burden of proof, they will have the last word. Neither side will be entitled to rebut the other once they sit down.\n\nDrawing from my experience in the courtroom, here's what I predict you will hear from both sides.\n\nThe defense will likely maximize the importance of Trump's former fixer, Cohen, in this scheme. In doing so, they will argue that the entirety of the case is built upon Cohen's word. And since he has zero credibility because of his documented lies, they will say, all charges must fail. Prosecutors, however, will minimize the significance of Cohen, noting that virtually all other witness testimony -- along with emails, text messages, audio recordings and other documents -- supports Cohen's claims.\n\nThe defense will assert that Trump did nothing illegal. They will no doubt highlight the fact that catching unfavorable media stories and killing them (buying rights to the stories and then stopping their publication) is an accepted and legal practice, as is the signing of non-disclosure agreements. It's also not illegal to desire to win an election or to protect your family or yourself from the revelations of embarrassing information.\n\nAs for Daniels, the defense will contest the affair (which Trump has consistently denied), while pressing the claim that Cohen went rogue and acted on his own accord in making the payoff deal. They will argue that he did so without Trump's knowledge or consent. And while the details she gave about their alleged encounter may have been salacious and entertaining, even if the jury believes it happened, a dalliance is not illegal.\n\nRegarding the payment of invoices or reimbursing Cohen for the expenses he incurred, again, this is not in itself illegal. Yes, Trump wrote out checks, which is perfectly appropriate, whether with a Sharpie pen or otherwise.\n\nAs to ledgers and invoices keeping track of these checks, Trump is the owner of the organization, not the bookkeeper or finance person. He has nothing to do with ledgers or invoices. And, by the way, he was pretty busy running the free world back in 2017, having little time to micromanage or even care about business records. None of Trump's financial people testified to Trump directing them to falsify anything.\n\nThe defense will remind the jury that the only witness who directly implicates Trump is Cohen. And they will have a field day pointing out that he is a Trump-hating disbarred lawyer and convicted felon, who lied to Congress, lied to banks, lied to business associates and even hid information from his own wife. The thousands of dollars he stole from the Trump Organization will certainly be mentioned, along with the millions he made for bashing Trump.\n\nIn short, the defense will argue that the credibility-challenged Cohen desperately wants to see Trump convicted, and has a vendetta against him for not offering him a job in the White House.\n\nThe defense will certainly highlight what they will style as the biggest lie of all: Cohen's testimony in which he claims that he briefed Trump and obtained approval for the Daniels deal during a 96-second phone call he made to Trump's bodyguard. Cohen claims Trump was with the bodyguard at the time, and that he handed Trump the phone. When it was pointed out that in the lead-up to that call Cohen had sent numerous text messages to the bodyguard about being harassed by a 14-year-old, with no mention of Daniels at all, Cohen seemed to be caught off-guard.\n\nFinally, the defense will reinforce that you cannot convict someone because you don't like their politics -- that would be anathema to our entire system of justice. And, by the way, how about the mysterious other crime that Trump was concealing? Why didn't the prosecution spend more time on that? Not guilty.\n\nBut not so fast, prosecutors will say.\n\nWe told you that this case was about a conspiracy and a cover-up, and that's exactly what we've proven, the prosecution will argue.\n\nThe defense would have you believe that this case hinges entirely on Cohen's word. It does not. Virtually every witness came in here and corroborated just about everything he said.\n\nHis motivation for doing so was obvious. Given the release of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, in which Trump bragged on a hot mic about committing sexual assault, he could ill afford to be embroiled in yet another scandal. You heard the communications director of his campaign, Hope Hicks, speak to the dire issues the campaign was confronting and how they were in full damage control after the tape was released. You also heard from her that Trump is a micromanager who knew exactly what was going on around him at all times. She also told you that Cohen is simply not the type of person to front money based upon the kindness of his heart.\n\nAnd, by the way, we know that Trump was fully aware of another deal -- the agreement with Playboy model Karen McDougal. We all heard the tape of Trump and Cohen plotting to pay her off so that she would not reveal their affair. How likely is it that Trump would be fully involved and engaged when it comes to that agreement, but be completely clueless about the payoff to Daniels? Not very. McDougal and Daniels even had the same lawyer negotiating the payments, Keith Davidson.\n\nYet, amazingly, the defense wants you to believe that the only direct evidence regarding Trump's involvement in this fraud is Cohen. Nonsense. And by the way, did we all not hear the audio of Cohen speaking to Davidson in which he talks about Trump lamenting the payment to Daniels even though Cohen says that everyone else told Trump it was the right thing to do?\n\nAnd think about what else proves Trump's awareness of this deal -- his annoyance with having to make it in the first place. According to Cohen, Trump made every effort to slow roll the payment to Daniels, asking him to delay it until after the election, saying: \"If I win, it will have no relevance because I'll be president, and if I lose no one will care.\"\n\nThen there's Cohen's meeting with Trump at the White House, directly before the reimbursement payments began. We know the meeting was not to discuss a Cohen appointment to be attorney general of the United States. And immediately following this meeting, Trump started sending Cohen \"retainer\" payments in his signature Sharpie pen. Interestingly, though, Cohen wasn't doing any legal work on Trump's behalf.\n\nThe evidence shows that in order for checks to be issued to Cohen, Trump would have had to give his approval. And the reason they were framed and structured as they were was to avoid detection for what their real purpose was -- reimbursement to Cohen, along with a bonus for a job well done. And if everything was so innocent, why send the unsigned checks to Trump's head of security via FedEx so they could be carried into the White House, signed by him and FedEx'd back? Seems like a rather elaborate arrangement to merely pay a lawyer for \"retainer\" fees.\n\nThe defense would have you believe that the man who wrote \"The Art of the Deal\" had no clue what the $35,000 monthly checks to Cohen were actually for, or if he even knew he was signing them at all, because he was so busy multitasking. How plausible is that? Not only did he know exactly what he was doing, but he knew exactly how the books would have to be manipulated to avoid questions of illegality, the prosecution will no doubt say.\n\nIn directing that the books be structured in a certain way, Trump was involved in the conspiracy concerning fraudulent ledgers and invoices -- whether he personally prepared them or not is immaterial. One thing he did personally sign was the checks themselves. What better speaks to personal involvement than his signature?\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter\n\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAnd why did he engage in this conspiracy and cover-up? To circumvent campaign finance laws during a presidential election. Do we need Cohen to tell us that -- or is that what our common sense and good judgment tell us? You can also trust the cell phone records, text messages, emails, audio you heard and other documents. Trump's guilt on all counts is undeniable.\n\nThe defense spent a significant amount of their time and energy undermining Cohen, who claims he talked with Trump about the Daniels scheme \"more than 20 times\" in October 2016. If jurors discount Cohen's testimony, there could be a problem for prosecutors as he provides the direct link to Trump's guilt. Alternatively, if prosecutors are successful in downplaying Cohen's significance, and focusing on all the other evidence showing Trump would not only be aware of the Daniels deal but establishing motive and reason to ensure the agreement got done, prosecutors could prevail. Why? Because that would make Trump's involvement in falsifying records obvious -- as would be his motivation to do so.\n\nWhat will the ultimate verdict be? The jury will decide. In making that decision, they have an awful lot to consider.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They are expected to last all day Tuesday and could stretch into the following day. After Judge Juan Merchan instructs jurors on the law, Trump and the rest of the country will be held in suspense to see whether he will become the first ex-president and presumptive GOP nominee to be convicted of a crime after allegedly falsifying financial records to hide a hush money payment to an adult film star in 2016.\n\nThe verdict will reverberate far beyond the courtroom and Trump's personal life since the case has become intertwined with his bid to reclaim the White House. The stakes are especially high since this is likely to be the only one of four pending criminal trials expected to go to a jury before November's election. The former president appeared to be in a bitter mood on the eve of his return to the courtroom, lashing out at opponents he called \"Human Scum\" in a message on social media marking Memorial Day.\n\nTrump's defense team is trying to spare their client the ignominy of a conviction that would stain his reputation. The ex-president's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, is expected to zero in on the credibility of Trump's former fixer-turned-nemesis, Michael Cohen, who endured a bruising cross-examination, and to ask why other key figures in the ex-president's business and personal orbit were not called by prosecutors, CNN's Kara Scannell reported.\n\nJoshua Steinglass, who is conducting closing arguments for the prosecution, will follow Blanche and is expected to spend several hours taking the jury through text messages, phone logs, other witnesses' testimony and the 34 allegedly falsified documents to corroborate Cohen's testimony. Ultimately, the team working for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, will try to convince seven men and five women jurors that Trump orchestrated a scheme to keep unflattering information from voters in what was an early example of election interference.\n\nTrump has denied having an affair with Stormy Daniels and has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers do not have to convince all of the jury that he is innocent -- they need only one juror to stand firm against the unanimous guilty verdict required to convict. Their conduct of the trial, in which they produced only two witnesses in a brief defense, signals they will argue that the state of New York has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the ex-president ordered and carried out a scheme, which, in any case, they say doesn't amount to breaking the law. They argued during the trial that there was no evidence of criminal intent. And they will seek to leave jurors with a devastating final picture of Cohen, who admitted on the stand that he was a liar and was benefiting financially from a growing media empire targeting his ex-boss.\n\nWhile there is a big difference with a hung jury that could force the judge to declare a mistrial, leaving an opening for prosecutors to try Trump again, any outcome that doesn't end in a conviction could serve Trump's political purposes, at least for now.\n\n\"I don't know if the voting public sees much of a difference between the two. For many, including the defendant, the only relevant question is whether he is a convicted felon or not,\" said CNN legal analyst Elliot Williams. \"So, I'd assume the defense is really just hoping to plant a seed in the head of that one juror who has enough doubts about the case and might be stubborn enough not to back down.\"\n\nCohen will be at the center of the drama again\n\nBlanche argued earlier in the month that Cohen was so conflicted as a witness that the case should not even go to the jury. He told the judge: \"He testified. And he lied under oath. In this courtroom. And the consequences of that lie, if accepted by the jury, is a conviction, potentially.\"\n\nClosing arguments are the stage in a case where lawyers summarize weeks of complex testimony and courtroom theatrics and sketch a narrative designed to shape the deliberations over evidence in the jury room. They are also used to impress upon jurors the huge stakes of a trial -- both the grave reality that a person's reputation and even liberty is on the line and the importance of upholding the rule of law.\n\nThe jury in this case must work through a complex legal equation at the heart of the case. To reach a guilty verdict, they must agree that New York state prosecutors have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified business records -- which is normally a misdemeanor in the state. Then, to convict Trump of a felony, the jury must determine that this was done to commit another crime -- in this case in relation to the 2016 election.\n\nThe prosecution is likely to argue that while the defense roughed up Cohen, he was truthful about the key elements of the case, and that his testimony was corroborated in advance by weeks of evidence.\n\nFormer Manhattan prosecutor Jeremy Saland told \"CNN This Morning\" on Sunday that it was not important how jurors generally viewed Cohen as a person. \"Whether you like Michael Cohen, whether you'd want him to date your sister, whether you'd want (him) to be your brother-in-law ... you don't have to like the guy. This is not a likability contest. (Was he) truthful in that moment in time? Was he honest and credible?\"\n\nIn days of evidence, the prosecution built a brick-by-brick legal edifice to pre-but the attacks on Cohen's credibility, which everyone knew were coming since the man who described himself as Trump's former \"thug\" went to jail for offenses including lying to Congress.\n\n\"There were weeks and weeks of testimony from witnesses who testified and whose testimony was corroborated by emails, bank records, contemporaneous phone calls, text messages, and other documents of a conspiracy,\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo argued in court.\n\nThat evidence was intended to create a storyline that highlighted Trump's alleged affair with Daniels, in explicit detail, in order to explain to jurors why he might have wanted to cover it up. They secured testimony from former tabloid publisher David Pecker to highlight Trump's history of shutting down embarrassing stories, and they produced evidence from former Trump associates, including ex-White House communications director Hope Hicks, to counter the idea Trump was simply seeking to hide his embarrassment about Daniels from his family and was instead most worried about voters forming an unfavorable impression of him in 2016.\n\nProsecutors also sketched a paper trail to suggest that Cohen was acting on the ex-president's orders in making a $130,000 payment to Daniels and that Trump was involved in cooking the financial books while serving as president to disguise a reimbursement to his former fixer.\n\nAnother test of Trump's brittle self-control\n\nTuesday's closing arguments will create another personal test for Trump, whose attacks on witnesses previously caused Merchan to warn he could be jailed over further violations of a partial gag order. While staying just inside Merchan's red line, Trump has continued to fire off daily rhetorical attacks on the judge, prosecutors and the Justice Department, along with false claims that the trial is part of an overarching conspiracy by President Joe Biden to destroy him before Election Day.\n\nTrump has raised doubts that the 12 New Yorkers who will judge him in the city where he made his name will give him a fair trial. And he has been aided by a parade of Republican supporters, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, who showed up to bolster Trump's assault on the justice system. Trump's belligerence would be incredible coming from any defendant, let alone one seeking to reassume his role as titular head and ultimate defender of the Constitution as the 47th president.\n\nJust over five months from the election, it's unclear if or how public opinion that is already polarized around Trump will shift when the verdict is announced. The trial has not gripped the attention of the country as it might have were television cameras allowed in the courtroom. And Trump used his multiple criminal indictments to his political advantage in clearing the Republican nominating field. But some polls suggest a conviction could weigh against him in a tight election with Biden. Past behavior also suggests Trump would use any acquittal or a mistrial caused by a hung jury to claim vindication in all his criminal cases and to fuel the campaign of personal and political vengeance around which he's promised to build a second presidency.\n\nThe final arguments will go ahead following an unusual weeklong break in the trial that occurred since Merchan wanted to avoid final arguments and jury instruction being interrupted by the Memorial Day holiday. The time off only seems to have escalated Trump's fury as one of the defining weeks of his life dawns.\n\n\"Happy Memorial Day to All, including the Human Scum that is working so hard to destroy our Once Great Country,\" Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social network that was especially jarring on a day dedicated to fallen members of the military. Trump fulminated against judges who had presided over a massive fraud judgment against him, his firm and his adult sons that was worth nearly half a billion dollars and a defamation suit in which he was ordered to pay the writer E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million.\n\nTrump concluded his tirade with the words: \"Now for Merchan!\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

They are expected to last all day Tuesday and could stretch into the following day. After Judge Juan Merchan instructs jurors on the law, Trump and the rest of the country will be held in suspense to see whether he will become the first ex-president and presumptive GOP nominee to be convicted of a crime after allegedly falsifying financial records to hide a hush money payment to an adult film star in 2016.\n\nThe verdict will reverberate far beyond the courtroom and Trump's personal life since the case has become intertwined with his bid to reclaim the White House. The stakes are especially high since this is likely to be the only one of four pending criminal trials expected to go to a jury before November's election. The former president appeared to be in a bitter mood on the eve of his return to the courtroom, lashing out at opponents he called \"Human Scum\" in a message on social media marking Memorial Day.\n\nTrump's defense team is trying to spare their client the ignominy of a conviction that would stain his reputation. The ex-president's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, is expected to zero in on the credibility of Trump's former fixer-turned-nemesis, Michael Cohen, who endured a bruising cross-examination, and to ask why other key figures in the ex-president's business and personal orbit were not called by prosecutors, CNN's Kara Scannell reported.\n\nJoshua Steinglass, who is conducting closing arguments for the prosecution, will follow Blanche and is expected to spend several hours taking the jury through text messages, phone logs, other witnesses' testimony and the 34 allegedly falsified documents to corroborate Cohen's testimony. Ultimately, the team working for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, will try to convince seven men and five women jurors that Trump orchestrated a scheme to keep unflattering information from voters in what was an early example of election interference.\n\nTrump has denied having an affair with Stormy Daniels and has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers do not have to convince all of the jury that he is innocent -- they need only one juror to stand firm against the unanimous guilty verdict required to convict. Their conduct of the trial, in which they produced only two witnesses in a brief defense, signals they will argue that the state of New York has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the ex-president ordered and carried out a scheme, which, in any case, they say doesn't amount to breaking the law. They argued during the trial that there was no evidence of criminal intent. And they will seek to leave jurors with a devastating final picture of Cohen, who admitted on the stand that he was a liar and was benefiting financially from a growing media empire targeting his ex-boss.\n\nWhile there is a big difference with a hung jury that could force the judge to declare a mistrial, leaving an opening for prosecutors to try Trump again, any outcome that doesn't end in a conviction could serve Trump's political purposes, at least for now.\n\n\"I don't know if the voting public sees much of a difference between the two. For many, including the defendant, the only relevant question is whether he is a convicted felon or not,\" said CNN legal analyst Elliot Williams. \"So, I'd assume the defense is really just hoping to plant a seed in the head of that one juror who has enough doubts about the case and might be stubborn enough not to back down.\"\n\nBlanche argued earlier in the month that Cohen was so conflicted as a witness that the case should not even go to the jury. He told the judge: \"He testified. And he lied under oath. In this courtroom. And the consequences of that lie, if accepted by the jury, is a conviction, potentially.\"\n\nClosing arguments are the stage in a case where lawyers summarize weeks of complex testimony and courtroom theatrics and sketch a narrative designed to shape the deliberations over evidence in the jury room. They are also used to impress upon jurors the huge stakes of a trial -- both the grave reality that a person's reputation and even liberty is on the line and the importance of upholding the rule of law.\n\nThe jury in this case must work through a complex legal equation at the heart of the case. To reach a guilty verdict, they must agree that New York state prosecutors have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified business records -- which is normally a misdemeanor in the state. Then, to convict Trump of a felony, the jury must determine that this was done to commit another crime -- in this case in relation to the 2016 election.\n\nThe prosecution is likely to argue that while the defense roughed up Cohen, he was truthful about the key elements of the case, and that his testimony was corroborated in advance by weeks of evidence.\n\nFormer Manhattan prosecutor Jeremy Saland told \"CNN This Morning\" on Sunday that it was not important how jurors generally viewed Cohen as a person. \"Whether you like Michael Cohen, whether you'd want him to date your sister, whether you'd want (him) to be your brother-in-law ... you don't have to like the guy. This is not a likability contest. (Was he) truthful in that moment in time? Was he honest and credible?\"\n\nIn days of evidence, the prosecution built a brick-by-brick legal edifice to pre-but the attacks on Cohen's credibility, which everyone knew were coming since the man who described himself as Trump's former \"thug\" went to jail for offenses including lying to Congress.\n\n\"There were weeks and weeks of testimony from witnesses who testified and whose testimony was corroborated by emails, bank records, contemporaneous phone calls, text messages, and other documents of a conspiracy,\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo argued in court.\n\nThat evidence was intended to create a storyline that highlighted Trump's alleged affair with Daniels, in explicit detail, in order to explain to jurors why he might have wanted to cover it up. They secured testimony from former tabloid publisher David Pecker to highlight Trump's history of shutting down embarrassing stories, and they produced evidence from former Trump associates, including ex-White House communications director Hope Hicks, to counter the idea Trump was simply seeking to hide his embarrassment about Daniels from his family and was instead most worried about voters forming an unfavorable impression of him in 2016.\n\nProsecutors also sketched a paper trail to suggest that Cohen was acting on the ex-president's orders in making a $130,000 payment to Daniels and that Trump was involved in cooking the financial books while serving as president to disguise a reimbursement to his former fixer.\n\nTuesday's closing arguments will create another personal test for Trump, whose attacks on witnesses previously caused Merchan to warn he could be jailed over further violations of a partial gag order. While staying just inside Merchan's red line, Trump has continued to fire off daily rhetorical attacks on the judge, prosecutors and the Justice Department, along with false claims that the trial is part of an overarching conspiracy by President Joe Biden to destroy him before Election Day.\n\nTrump has raised doubts that the 12 New Yorkers who will judge him in the city where he made his name will give him a fair trial. And he has been aided by a parade of Republican supporters, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, who showed up to bolster Trump's assault on the justice system. Trump's belligerence would be incredible coming from any defendant, let alone one seeking to reassume his role as titular head and ultimate defender of the Constitution as the 47th president.\n\nJust over five months from the election, it's unclear if or how public opinion that is already polarized around Trump will shift when the verdict is announced. The trial has not gripped the attention of the country as it might have were television cameras allowed in the courtroom. And Trump used his multiple criminal indictments to his political advantage in clearing the Republican nominating field. But some polls suggest a conviction could weigh against him in a tight election with Biden. Past behavior also suggests Trump would use any acquittal or a mistrial caused by a hung jury to claim vindication in all his criminal cases and to fuel the campaign of personal and political vengeance around which he's promised to build a second presidency.\n\nThe final arguments will go ahead following an unusual weeklong break in the trial that occurred since Merchan wanted to avoid final arguments and jury instruction being interrupted by the Memorial Day holiday. The time off only seems to have escalated Trump's fury as one of the defining weeks of his life dawns.\n\n\"Happy Memorial Day to All, including the Human Scum that is working so hard to destroy our Once Great Country,\" Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social network that was especially jarring on a day dedicated to fallen members of the military. Trump fulminated against judges who had presided over a massive fraud judgment against him, his firm and his adult sons that was worth nearly half a billion dollars and a defamation suit in which he was ordered to pay the writer E.

The jurors, who are expected to get the case as soon as Wednesday, could reach a verdict in a matter of days.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 payment to an adult film star on the eve of the 2016 election to keep her quiet about an alleged affair. The case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg may hinge on whether jurors believe Trump had an intent to defraud as well as conceal other crimes, namely election law and tax violations.\n\nWhile the false-records charges are \"simple and easy to understand,\" turning those misdemeanors into felonies using New York election law along with other legal theories is more complicated, said Jennifer Rodgers, a former federal prosecutor.\n\nThe defense's closing argument will cast the issue as \"muddled, confusing, and full of reasonable doubt,\" Rodgers said, while prosecutors \"will want to cast their enhancement theory as easy to understand and well supported by overwhelming evidence.\"\n\n\"It will be a tale of two cases, for sure.\"\n\nThe case is one of four criminal prosecutions Trump is facing as he campaigns to return to the White House, including state and federal charges over his failed attempt to overturn the result of the 2020 election. The presumptive Republican nominee has denied wrongdoing in all the cases, claiming without evidence that they're part of a coordinated conspiracy against him by Democrats.\n\nThe defense and prosecution in the hush money trial rested their cases early last week, but Justice Juan Merchan delayed closing arguments so they would not be split from deliberations by the holiday weekend and previously scheduled days off.\n\nMerchan has said closing arguments are expected to last all day Tuesday and could bleed into Wednesday. The judge must also give jurors so-called charging instructions to explain the law and aid their deliberations. Merchan told jurors they'll start deliberating \"hopefully, at some point on Wednesday.\"\n\nClosing arguments are important for prosecutors because a small number of witnesses \"may have overshadowed the rest of the evidence,\" according to Rodgers. She said the government must \"re-acquaint jurors with all of the evidence in the case, not just the unforgettable moments.\"\n\nProsecutors, who have the burden of proof, will argue that their case was overwhelmingly supported by multiple witnesses along with a trove of emails, text messages, business records and other pieces of evidence.\n\nBragg's team relied heavily on its star witness, former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who made the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels -- the adult film actress -- and was allegedly reimbursed by Trump in monthly installments throughout 2017.\n\nCohen gave jurors a first-hand account of every stage of the alleged hush money scheme, from its inception at a 2015 Trump Tower meeting to efforts to deceive the press and federal election regulators when news of the scheme leaked out three years later.\n\nMuch of Cohen's testimony was backed by other witnesses or documents. Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified he met with Trump and Cohen at Trump Tower in 2015 to discuss how he could use his tabloid to help Trump win the White House.\n\nHope Hicks, Trump's former campaign press secretary, testified about how the Daniels story was seen as an existential threat to Trump's campaign on the eve of the election. She said Trump was less bothered when the story eventually came out in 2018 because he'd already won, bolstering Bragg's charge that the payouts were intended to help Trump win the election.\n\nOne person who didn't testify was Trump, but his team, led by Todd Blanche, will seek to sow doubt in the mind of at least one juror. His closing argument will likely focus heavily on Cohen's credibility, which Blanche damaged during a withering cross-examination.\n\nBlanche will remind jurors of Cohen's well-documented perjury as well as testimony at the trial that the defense says turned out to be false.\n\nBased on arguments last week, Blanche can also be expected to hammer home the notion that prosecutors failed to prove Trump had any intent to defraud and that there was no conspiracy to violate election laws.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Spencer Platt/Getty Images hide caption\n\nAttorneys will deliver their closing arguments Tuesday in former President Donald Trump's criminal trial in New York.\n\nThe summations come after a series of witnesses and documents have supported the case made by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. But Trump's defense says too much depends on the testimony of Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, a convicted liar.\n\nThe defense comes first. When the trial testimony began five weeks ago, the defense highlighted how long ago this was: \"pre-COVID.\"\n\nThey said the sexual encounter with adult film actress Stormy Daniels never happened. They said that Trump himself never issued the false documents, he just signed nine of the 11 checks when they were presented to him. But most of all, they said Cohen is a liar, and there's no way to prove that Trump was fully cognizant of the crimes unless you accept Cohen's testimony about conversations with Trump.\n\nCohen was an unflappably calm witness. When he was asked: Did you commit crimes, did you lie to Congress, did you lie to banks, he said that he had. But for the most part, these were old lies. There was just one place where the defense may have raised a new inconsistency: when they pointed out that text messages suggest one of the key conversations with Trump may not have happened, because Cohen at that time was being harassed by a 14-year old prankster.\n\nBut, the prosecution may have cleaned that up when they pointed up something that the defense didn't deal with: There were many many conversations with Trump, including on the day the payments were wired to Daniels.\n\nCohen testified, and there was back up, that many of the lies, like the lie to Congress, were done to benefit Trump, in that case to hide dealings over a Trump Tower in Moscow. But mostly the prosecution worked hard to present all kinds of documentation they could use to back up Cohen' claims. For example, Trump's former comptroller described a meeting where he was told by Trump's former CFO Allen Weisselberg that Cohen would be reimbursed through payments described as \"a legal retainer.\"\n\nHope Hicks, Trump's former communications aide, testified that when Trump told her Cohen had made the payment out of the kindness of his heart, she didn't believe it, because Cohen is the kind of person who always wants credit.\n\nYears ago, Cohen testified to Congress that Trump told him in the Oval Office in 2017: \"Don't worry, Michael. Your January and February reimbursement checks are coming. They were FedEx'd from New York. And it takes a while for that to get through the White House system.\"\n\nAnd the DA presented evidence from four current and former Trump employees that showed that Cohen indeed met with Trump in the Oval Office, and that it did take a while to get through the system, and that the checks did soon arrive. So they are likely to lean into all the corroboration -- to say you don't have to take Cohen's word for it, this all happened beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe jury will be instructed Tuesday, start deliberating, and a verdict could come any time, beginning the same day.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrea_bernstein@npr.org", "name": "Andrea Bernstein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Bronx", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Bronx"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_Moscow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trump Tower Moscow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Weisselberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allen Weisselberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hope Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comptroller", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comptroller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Merchant_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Merchant Services", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x576+0+54/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe7%2Fe7%2F2cda491e40fe9a3a868877dde074%2Fgettyimages-2154370671.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-23", "textStart": 67, "textEnd": 73}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The jury will then hear jury instructions, which will provide them with the framework to use to decide a verdict.\n\nA verdict in which Trump is acquitted or found guilty could also come as early as this week. Here are three things to look for as this historic trial wraps up.\n\nThe prosecution and the defense will have the chance to address the jury with their closing arguments. Both statements are expected to be long and will likely last the entire day as lawyers give hourslong summaries of the evidence and witness testimony.\n\nThe defense only needs to convince at least one juror that the prosecution has not proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, not prove Trump's innocence, to prevent a guilty verdict.\n\nAs such, in their closing arguments, the defense will likely try to find holes in the prosecution's case by countering porn star Stormy Daniels's testimony about her time with Trump. They will also likely try to distance the former president from knowing the exact details of the payments made to his former attorney Michael Cohen, who paid the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels.\n\nOver 19 days in court, the prosecution called 20 witnesses, resulting in testimony totaling over 50 hours. In closing, arguments will likely emphasize to the jury that they can trust the financial paperwork they have seen as evidence firsthand.\n\nThey will also likely lean into Daniels's testimony, as well as Cohen's, in which he said Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme.\n\nFollowing closing arguments, Judge Juan Merchan, who is presiding over the case, will address the jury for about an hour to instruct them on what it can consider when deciding a verdict on the case.\n\nThe core of the case is the $130,000 hush money payment made to Daniels in 2016 to keep her quiet about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump. The prosecution claims Trump falsified business records related to the payment, which they describe as election interference due to the payment happening mere weeks before the 2016 election.\n\nThe defense asked Merchan to consider the \"extraordinarily important\" nature of the case -- it is the first criminal trial of a former president -- when giving the jury instructions. The prosecution objected, and Merchan agreed it would not be in line with standard jury instructions.\n\n\"When you say it's a very important case, you're asking me to change the law, and I'm not going to do that,\" Merchan said.\n\nA verdict could be reached as soon as Friday. Following closing arguments and jury instructions, the jurors will enter a period of deliberation in which they will evaluate all 34 counts against Trump.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nDeliberations could take hours or days, which means the trial could potentially end as soon as Friday, but there is no time limit, and deliberations could take weeks.\n\nAll 12 jurors must agree on a guilty or not guilty verdict in order for Merchan to accept the verdict. A mistrial or hung jury could be the result if a verdict cannot be unanimously reached, as Merchan would declare the jury \"hopelessly deadlocked.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "annabella_rosciglione@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Annabella Rosciglione", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_instructions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury instructions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Merchant_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Merchant Services", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24142774879137.jpg.optimal.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Trump denies Daniels' allegation of a sexual encounter in 2006 that was used as a potential political weapon to impact voters before the 2016 election.\n\nTrump's legal team called two witnesses of their own - one that was clapped back by Judge Juan Merchan in an exchange denounced by legal expert Alan Dershowitz, who was in attendance last week. The former president himself did not testify, saying the prosecutors have no case because they failed to make calling a legal expense a legal expense a crime.\n\nInstead, they have tried to raise doubts about the credibility of prosecution witnesses, most notably Cohen, who testified as Trump's fixer he handled the payment to Daniels, claiming Trump approved of it to keep Democrats from smearing him publicly before the election.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Trump's lawyers got Cohen to discuss his felony convictions and imprisonment, his history of lying and his lingering animosity for his former boss. Cohen also admitted to stealing from Trump's company.\n\nIf found guilty, Trump faces up to four years in prison, although imprisonment is unlikely for a first-time felon convicted of such a crime - which has never been brought before a court.\n\nA conviction will not prevent Trump from trying to take back the White House from Democrat President Joe Biden as the Republican candidate in the Nov. 5 election, and it would not prevent him from taking office if he won. Opinion polls show the two candidates locked in a tight race.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, normally a misdemeanor under New York law.\n\nProsecutors in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office elevated those charges to felonies, saying Trump falsified those records to disguise what amounted to an illegal campaign contribution: the payment that bought Daniels' silence about the alleged 2006 sexual encounter at a time when Trump was already facing multiple accusations of sexual misconduct.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing. His lawyers have implied the $130,000 payment for Daniels' silence was intended to spare Trump's family from embarrassment, not to protect his White House bid. Prosecutors will cite testimony to argue otherwise.\n\nTrump faces three other criminal prosecutions as well, but none is likely to go to trial before the election.\n\nSeparate cases in Washington and Georgia accuse him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat, while another case in Florida charges him with mishandling classified information after he left office in 2021.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases and says they are an effort by Biden's Democratic allies to hobble his presidential bid.\n\nReuters and Newsmax's Eric Mack contributed to this report.",

Trump denies Daniels' allegation of a sexual encounter in 2006 when he was married to his current wife Melania.\n\nTrump's legal team called two witnesses of their own, and the former president himself did not testify.\n\nInstead, they have tried to raise doubts about the credibility of prosecution witnesses, most notably Michael Cohen, who testified that as Trump's fixer he handled the payment to Daniels and that Trump approved the cover-up.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Trump's lawyers got Cohen to discuss his felony convictions and imprisonment, his history of lying and his lingering animosity for his former boss. Cohen also admitted to stealing from Trump's company.\n\nIf found guilty, Trump faces up to four years in prison, although imprisonment is unlikely for a first-time felon convicted of such a crime.\n\nA conviction will not prevent Trump from trying to take back the White House from Democratic President Joe Biden as the Republican candidate in the Nov. 5 election, and it would not prevent him from taking office if he won. Opinion polls show the two candidates locked in a tight race.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, normally a misdemeanor under New York law.\n\nProsecutors in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office elevated those charges to felonies, saying Trump falsified those records to disguise what amounted to an illegal campaign contribution: the payment that bought Daniels' silence about the alleged 2006 sexual encounter at a time when Trump was already facing multiple accusations of sexual misconduct.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing. His lawyers have implied that the $130,000 payment for Daniels' silence was intended to spare Trump's family from embarrassment, not to protect his White House bid. Prosecutors will cite testimony to argue otherwise.\n\nTrump faces three other criminal prosecutions as well, but none is likely to go to trial before the election.\n\nSeparate cases in Washington and Georgia accuse him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat, while another case in Florida charges him with mishandling classified information after he left office in 2021.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases and says they are an effort by Biden's Democratic allies to hobble his presidential bid.

To mold their dueling accounts, each side can draw from a deep well of evidence: testimony from 22 witnesses, reams of emails and a surreptitious recording of Trump coordinating a secret payoff.\n\nTo persuade the jury, the prosecution and defense will begin with different versions of the same basic set of facts: Trump's fixer, Michael Cohen, struck a hush-money deal with a porn actor in the waning days of the 2016 presidential campaign. The undisputed facts concern that $130,000 transaction; Cohen paid the porn actor, Stormy Daniels, to silence her story of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nSign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times\n\nPretty much everything else is up for debate.\n\nProsecutors have argued that Trump directed Cohen to pay Daniels and approved a criminal scheme to reimburse Cohen, disguising the repayments by saying that they were made for legal services that in fact were nonexistent. Their case is backed by the testimony of Cohen himself, as well as Daniels, several other witnesses and phone records, text messages and emails.\n\nBut the defense has cast Cohen as a liar, suggested that he acted alone in paying Daniels and argued that he was never even reimbursed for the payment. Instead, they have said, Trump repaid him for actual legal services. Trump also says he never had sex with Daniels.\n\nTodd Blanche, the lead defense lawyer, is expected to deliver the closing argument and to assert that the case hinges on Cohen, whose testimony provided the only evidence that Trump had direct knowledge of a plot to falsify the reimbursement records. He will cast Cohen as a jilted ex-employee who is obsessed with Trump and would profit from his conviction.\n\nHe may also seek to call jurors' attention to two key characters who did not testify: Allen Weisselberg, Trump's longtime moneyman, who prosecutors say devised the structure of the reimbursement, and Keith Schiller, Trump's longtime bodyguard. In late 2016, both men had crucial dealings with Cohen revolving around the hush-money payment.\n\nBut Joshua Steinglass, the prosecutor who will get the last word, could object to any references to Weisselberg, who is currently behind bars for perjury in a separate case. He is also expected to highlight every last shred of evidence -- including testimony from other witnesses -- that supports Cohen's account of the hush-money deal and the reimbursement.\n\nAnd Steinglass may remind jurors of Daniels' deeply discomfiting testimony about what she says was an uninvited sexual encounter as he seeks to convince jurors that Trump was desperate to silence her story in the days before the 2016 election.\n\nHere's what to know as the trial enters its seventh -- and potentially final -- week.\n\n-- The closing statements are expected to last all Tuesday and could spill into Wednesday. As soon as Wednesday, the judge presiding over the case, Juan Merchan, will instruct jurors on the relevant law before they begin deliberations.\n\n-- It could take the jury anywhere from a few hours to weeks to reach a verdict. During private deliberations, the courtroom will be open to journalists, but little is expected to take place. Jurors can ask the judge for specific explanations on confusing points of law, or that testimony be read back in the courtroom.\n\n-- Trump is accused of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to the reimbursement. If convicted, he faces up to four years in prison. The 22 witnesses did not include Trump, who opted not to take the stand in his own defense.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Weisselberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allen Weisselberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Schiller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keith Schiller"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8dNGr1tQ3o8DQpSlBJWChg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MTg7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/88e062f0-1ce5-11ef-bfe7-af6320c25961", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments Tuesday.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they won't be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence -- and there were many. Judge Juan M. Merchan, for instance, fined Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases Trump is confronting as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nWhere each Trump case stands Classified documents case Election interference Hush money scheme Georgia election indictment Civil cases Arizona election indictment\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

They have the unenviable task of deciding the unprecedented question of whether a former president of the United States should be found guilty in a criminal court.\n\nTheir verdict will not only determine Trump's fate, but it may have a material impact on the outcome of the 2024 presidential contest. While jurors are supposed to consider only evidence presented to them during the trial, one can only imagine that they feel the weight of the historic responsibility that has been thrust upon them.\n\nWhile we can speculate about what the jury will decide, it's important to consider what will happen after the verdict becomes public. Trump and his allies have already laid the groundwork to denounce a guilty verdict as the product of a political prosecution in a kangaroo court. Trump calls it a \"Biden show trial.\"\n\nThe former president will almost certainly appeal a guilty verdict, pointing, among other things, to the allegedly prejudicial effect of the admission of evidence about his sexual encounter with Stormy Daniels. The appellate process would also give the former president more fodder for his claim that the New York prosecution constituted election interference.\n\nAnd, if he is found not guilty or if there is a hung jury, Trump will no doubt use that result as an accelerant in his presidential campaign. The New York Times quotes Alyssa Farah Griffin, Trump's former White House communications director, as saying, \"An acquittal or a hung jury is just absolute gold for Trump. And it will resonate with a lot of people.\"\n\nSome experts think the evidence against Trump is \"middling -- not overwhelming, not patently deficient, but somewhere toward the lower end of that spectrum.\" As a result, the chances of a hung jury \"are far higher than in a normal case.\"\n\nFormer federal and state prosecutor Elie Honig is one who foresees that result and urges people to \"consider the difficulty of getting any 12 people to agree on anything,\" especially when the stakes are \"liberty or prison.\"\n\nI agree. The case against Trump is hardly a slam dunk.\n\nAnd whatever the verdict, it looks like he has a ready-made strategy for the day after the jury renders its verdict. At the same time, there is little evidence that Trump's political opponents really know what they will do when the trial concludes.\n\nAs we await the jury's deliberations, commentators highlight the evidence they consider crucial to the verdict. Some point to Stormy Daniels's testimony. As CNN noted, she described \"in vivid details ... certain things that were entirely taboo, that we wouldn't really expect to hear in a courtroom....\"\n\nCNN says that her testimony was \"not necessarily directly tied to the allegations or the charges in this case, but hearing her describe this alleged night with Trump in the hotel room, down to the anecdote of her smacking him on the butt with a magazine and his reaction in court, audibly cursing at that moment, was definitely a memory.\"\n\nThen there was the testimony of Michael Cohen, who said that Trump knew exactly the purpose of the payments Trump made. Cohen, a convicted liar and perjurer, was hardly anyone's idea of a perfect witness. Still, his testimony may play a key role when the jury considers whether Trump falsified business records and to commit or conceal another crime.\n\n\"Underscoring his importance,\" USA Today says, \"the defense's cross-examination of Cohen lasted about eight hours, much longer than the entire case put on by the defense.\" While Todd Blanche, Trump's lead defense lawyer, \"didn't visibly rattle Cohen or get him to display his infamously volatile temper..., [he] exposed the prosecution's key weakness: that they are relying on the testimony of a vengeful former employee with a major ax to grind against his former boss.\"\n\nWhile much less sensational than Daniels' and Cohen's appearances as witnesses, the prosecution hopes that the jury will, as NBC News reports, focus on the extensive paper trail in the case. They offered evidence that \"34 false entries were made in New York business records to conceal the initial covert $130,000 payment.\"\n\nProsecutors say the \"catch and kill\" scheme involved 11 falsified invoices, 12 falsified general ledger entries, and 11 checks falsely recording hush money repayments to Cohen as a \"retainer.\" Those checks were issued from the Trump Revocable Trust and his personal bank account \"for a phony purpose.\"\n\n\"Each check was processed by the Trump Organization and illegally disguised as a payment for legal services rendered pursuant to a non-existent retainer agreement.\"\n\nWhile the jury considers this evidence, most Americans are going about their business without paying much attention to Trump's trial. One poll asked respondents how closely they were following Trump's hush money case.\n\n\"A majority in this poll -- 55 percent -- said they were not following it much or at all, versus 45 who reported paying some or a lot of attention to the trial.\"\n\nBut when the verdict is announced, that is likely to change. It would be surprising if what the jury decides escapes notice even among those who now are not following the trial closely.\n\nAnd, if the general public fairly approximates the views of the people who will decide Trump's fate, the news is not good for the prosecution.\n\nA PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll found that only \"47 percent of Americans think Trump has done something illegal, including 86 percent of Democrats and 42 percent of independents. Meanwhile, another 30 percent say he has acted unethically, but not illegally. And 21 percent say Trump has done nothing wrong.\"\n\nMoreover, as the trial has gone on, the belief that Trump will be convicted has declined. A YouGov poll found that \"[a]round 39 percent of Democrats said in late April that Trump would be convicted. Now, the number stands at 34 percent.\"\n\n\"With independents,\" YouGov reports, \"21 percent believed in the conviction late last month; it is at 17 percent\" in the new survey. With GOP voters, that belief dropped from 17 percent to 14 percent.\"\n\nOverall, \"22 percent of Americans think Trump will be convicted in the Manhattan case.\"\n\nWhatever the verdict, it seems like the New York trial has been another instance in which Trump has outgunned his critics in the war to shape public opinion. While he has consistently broadcast the message that his trial has been unfair, with a few exceptions, the public has heard little to defend its fairness and integrity.\n\nUnlike Trump's simple, consistent, and visceral criticism of his trial, the few who have spoken out to defend it offer a more complex argument. The case made by Mark C. Zauderer in a Boston Globe editorial is typical.\n\nAs Zauderer put it, \"No court can ensure that those who serve as jurors in a high-profile case -- especially one involving a former president of the United States -- can affirm they have no views about the matter; to try to achieve that would be a fool's errand. But New York's respect for the jury system and the processes for ensuring a fair trial are second to none. And Donald Trump, like every citizen who faces criminal accusations, is enjoying the benefits of this system.\"\n\nWhile Zauderer may be right, America will pay a high price for the stark difference in the messaging wars starting the day the jury renders its verdict and lasting for a long time thereafter.", "source": {"uri": "verdict.justia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Verdict"},

Here's what you need to know - ExBulletin", "body": "When prosecutors make their final argument to New York jurors on Tuesday about why they should convict former President Donald Trump of a series of business crimes, they will face the daunting task of piecing together weeks of testimony and evidence that, according to them, prove that Trump committed crimes to help his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nClosing arguments in Trump's landmark hush money criminal case will give prosecutors from District Attorney Alvin Braggs' office a chance to explain to 12 jurors how each witness they called and the elements of Evidence they presented strengthens their case for a guilty verdict on 34 felony counts. falsification of business records.\n\nThat was already going to be a complicated task for a trial that has been going on since mid-April and frequently features witnesses examining the dry details of business record-keeping and other mundane testimony. But prosecutors will have an added degree of difficulty with a long break before closing arguments because jurors will be absent from the case since Tuesday.\n\nThere are many moments during the trial where you obtain testimony or present a document or other piece of evidence, and the jury asks, well, how does this fit in? It's inevitable. It's your job at the close to weave it all together and make sense of it. And so that will be particularly the case here because it's a lengthy trial, said CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor.\n\nThis, more than a typical case, will be a final case, he added.\n\nFormer New York prosecutor Bernarda Villalona said prosecutors would use their final findings to tell the story from the beginning. She said that unlike their opening statement, which lasted about 40 minutes, prosecutors' closing remarks in the case could last several hours and feature a visual aid like a PowerPoint presentation to help the jury return to some of the key evidence.\n\nThe boredom is over. The most annoying thing was having them sit down to hear it, Villalona added, referring to the 12 jurors. Interestingly, the boring part is actually the most important part of the file, because it's the part that gives you the documents. The star witness in this case are the documents, and the documents speak for themselves.\n\nTrump's lawyers will first present their closing arguments on Tuesday, followed by arguments from prosecutors. Once both sides have completed their arguments, Judge Juan Merchan will instruct the jury on which charges to consider against the former president; then, the jurors will begin their deliberations. The judge said he expects that to happen Wednesday.\n\nClosing arguments will begin exactly one week after the defense finished its presentation Tuesday and more than five weeks after opening statements were delivered and the first witness, former tabloid executive David Pecker, came to the rod.\n\nThe prosecution called 20 witnesses over 19 days in court, their testimony totaling more than 50 hours. Many of their witnesses were not household names, although some, including former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and adult film actress Stormy Daniels, whose alleged affair with Trump is at the center of the case, were prominent figures whose testimony is undoubtedly etched in the minds of the jurors. . (Trump has denied the alleged affair.)\n\nFor its part, Trump's team called only two witnesses: a paralegal who submitted phone records into evidence and Robert Costello, a lawyer who was in talks with Cohen to represent him in 2018.\n\nTrump faces 34 counts of first-degree falsifying business records to conceal repayment of secret payments made before Daniels' election in 2016. If convicted, Merchan could sentence Trump to probation or to a sentence of 1 1/3 to 4 years on each count in state prison, with a maximum of 20 years.\n\nProsecutors will likely argue in their closing arguments that each of their witnesses plays a key role in the case, despite their professional rank or proximity to the alleged crimes. They will also likely have to push back against defense claims that Cohen, the prosecution's star witness, is undermining their case because of his history of dishonesty, Honig said.\n\nThe prosecution's case will be that all the evidence fits together and is corroborated and that there is no need to rely on the words of a single witness. We will say that it is a documentary case, he explained, then describing the different accounting documents presented during the trial.\n\nAnd they will say: Michael Cohens is here to guide you, but you don't need to believe him, everything he says is supported by evidence and other testimony, Honig said.\n\nDuring the trial, prosecutors repeatedly presented jurors with the 11 invoices, 12 vouchers and 11 checks, the 34 documents that make up the falsified charges in business records that were used to pay Cohen $420,000 in 2017 , money which included the reimbursement of the secret payment of $130,000 increased to take into account. for taxes.\n\nProsecutors showed jurors how Cohen sent the Trump Organization monthly invoices for $35,000, which were processed by the Trump company's controller so the checks could be cleared. Trump signed nine of the 11 checks. (The other two checks were paid from Trump's revocable trust and signed by former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg and one of Trump's sons.)\n\nKaren Friedman Agnifilo, who for a time served as a top prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney's office, said she expects the prosecution to present several themes in its closing arguments, including the fact that most of the people who testified for their case were Trump witnesses. would expect to be friendly with him.\n\nThe other theme, she said, might be: Look at the kind of people Trump values, with prosecutors saying the former president chose to surround himself with people like Cohen and Pecker, who did Trump's bidding before the 2016 elections.\n\nThey are his people, he chose them. And he shouldn't benefit from it now. Because they're defective, you can't rely on them, prosecutors might argue, Agnifilo said.\n\nAnd even if you don't rely on them, she said, echoing Honig, the third theme will be: You don't have to, because everything is corroborated either by other witnesses or by documents, either through files, or through Trump's own words.\n\nThe length of the trial may not pose much of a challenge to jurors during their deliberations, Villalona said, since they were allowed to take notes during the proceedings and will be able to request that parts of the trial be reread . them.\n\nThe nice thing about New York is they can ask to have the entire trial read back to them and the judge will do it, she said. So if they forgot something that David Pecker said on the first or second day of the trial, they can read it again. She said any pieces of evidence could also be sent to jurors for a closer look as they consider a verdict.\n\nNonetheless, each side's closing arguments will be carefully crafted to not only secure a verdict in their favor, but also to mark each attorney's place in this historic trial, Villalona reflected.\n\nThe prosecution and defense will make the final argument of their careers, she said.\n\nCNN's Jeremy Herb, Kara Scannell and Lauren of the Valley contributed to this report.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri":

The jurors, who are expected to get the case as soon as Wednesday, could reach a verdict in a matter of days.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 payment to an adult film star on the eve of the 2016 election to keep her quiet about an alleged affair. The case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg may hinge on whether jurors believe Trump had an intent to defraud as well as conceal other crimes, namely election law and tax violations.\n\nWhile the false-records charges are \"simple and easy to understand,\" turning those misdemeanors into felonies using New York election law along with other legal theories is more complicated, said Jennifer Rodgers, a former federal prosecutor.\n\nThe defense's closing argument will cast the issue as \"muddled, confusing, and full of reasonable doubt,\" Rodgers said, while prosecutors \"will want to cast their enhancement theory as easy to understand and well supported by overwhelming evidence.\"\n\n\"It will be a tale of two cases, for sure.\"\n\nThe case is one of four criminal prosecutions Trump is facing as he campaigns to return to the White House, including state and federal charges over his failed attempt to overturn the result of the 2020 election. The presumptive Republican nominee has denied wrongdoing in all the cases, claiming without evidence that they're part of a coordinated conspiracy against him by Democrats.\n\nThe defense and prosecution in the hush money trial rested their cases early last week, but Justice Juan Merchan delayed closing arguments so they would not be split from deliberations by the holiday weekend and previously scheduled days off.\n\nMerchan has said closing arguments are expected to last all day Tuesday and could bleed into Wednesday. The judge must also give jurors so-called charging instructions to explain the law and aid their deliberations. Merchan told jurors they'll start deliberating \"hopefully, at some point on Wednesday.\"\n\nClosing arguments are important for prosecutors because a small number of witnesses \"may have overshadowed the rest of the evidence,\" according to Rodgers. She said the government must \"re-acquaint jurors with all of the evidence in the case, not just the unforgettable moments.\"\n\nProsecutors, who have the burden of proof, will argue that their case was overwhelmingly supported by multiple witnesses along with a trove of emails, text messages, business records and other pieces of evidence.\n\nBragg's team relied heavily on its star witness, former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who made the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels -- the adult film actress -- and was allegedly reimbursed by Trump in monthly installments throughout 2017.\n\nCohen gave jurors a first-hand account of every stage of the alleged hush money scheme, from its inception at a 2015 Trump Tower meeting to efforts to deceive the press and federal election regulators when news of the scheme leaked out three years later.\n\nMuch of Cohen's testimony was backed by other witnesses or documents. Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified he met with Trump and Cohen at Trump Tower in 2015 to discuss how he could use his tabloid to help Trump win the White House.\n\nHope Hicks, Trump's former campaign press secretary, testified about how the Daniels story was seen as an existential threat to Trump's campaign on the eve of the election. She said Trump was less bothered when the story eventually came out in 2018 because he'd already won, bolstering Bragg's charge that the payouts were intended to help Trump win the election.\n\nOne person who didn't testify was Trump, but his team, led by Todd Blanche, will seek to sow doubt in the mind of at least one juror. His closing argument will likely focus heavily on Cohen's credibility, which Blanche damaged during a withering cross-examination.\n\nBlanche will remind jurors of Cohen's well-documented perjury as well as testimony at the trial that the defense says turned out to be false.\n\nBased on arguments last week, Blanche can also be expected to hammer home the notion that prosecutors failed to prove Trump had any intent to defraud and that there was no conspiracy to violate election laws.\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.

Here's what to know", "body": "CNN --\n\nWhen prosecutors make their final pitch Tuesday to New York jurors for why they should convict former President Donald Trump of a slew of business crimes, they'll face the burdensome task of weaving together weeks of testimony and evidence they say proves Trump committed felonies to help his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThe closing arguments in Trump's historic hush money criminal case will give prosecutors from District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office an opportunity to explain to the 12 jurors how each witness they called and piece of evidence they presented bolsters their case for a guilty verdict on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nThat was already going to be a complicated task for a trial that's been underway since mid-April and frequently featured witnesses going over the dry details of business recordkeeping and other mundane testimony. But prosecutors will have an extra degree of difficulty with a long break ahead of closing arguments, as jurors will have been away from the case since Tuesday.\n\n\"There's plenty of moments during trial where you're getting a piece of testimony or you're introducing a document or other exhibit, and the jury is thinking, 'Well, how does this fit in?' That's unavoidable. It's your job at closing to weave it all together, and to make it make sense. And so that will be especially the case here because this is a long trial,\" said CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor.\n\n\"This, more than even your typical case, is going to be a closing case,\" he added.\n\nFormer New York prosecutor Bernarda Villalona said prosecutors will use their closing arguments \"to tell the story from the very beginning.\" She said that unlike their opening statement, which lasted about 40 minutes, prosecutors' final remarks in the case could go on for several hours and feature a visual aid like a PowerPoint presentation to help walk the jury back through some of the key evidence.\n\n\"The boring is over. The boring part was having them sit down to hear it,\" added Villalona, referring to the 12 jurors. \"Interestingly enough, the boring part is actually the most important part of the case because the boring part is what gives you the documents. The star witness in this case are the documents, and the documents speak for themselves.\"\n\nTrump's attorneys will present their closing arguments first on Tuesday, followed by the arguments from prosecutors. Once both sides finish their arguments, Judge Juan Merchan will instruct the jury as to the charges it must consider against the former president; then, the jurors will begin their deliberations. The judge has said he expects this to happen on Wednesday.\n\nThe closing arguments will begin exactly a week after the defense rested its case on Tuesday and more than five weeks after opening statements were delivered and the first witness, former tabloid executive David Pecker, took the stand.\n\nThe prosecution called 20 witnesses over 19 days in court, with their testimony totaling over 50 hours. Many of their witnesses were not household names, though some, including former Trump attorney Michael Cohen and adult film actress Stormy Daniels -- whose alleged affair with Trump is at the center of the case -- were high-profile figures whose testimony is no doubt seared into jurors' minds. (Trump has denied the alleged affair.)\n\nFor its part, Trump's team called just two witnesses: a paralegal who entered phone records into evidence and Robert Costello, an attorney who was in talks with Cohen to represent him in 2018.\n\nTrump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree to cover up the reimbursement of hush money payments made before the 2016 election to Daniels. If convicted, Merchan could sentence Trump to probation or a sentence of 1 1/3 to 4 years on each count in state prison, with a maximum of 20 years.\n\nWhat prosecutors might argue\n\nProsecutors will likely contend during their closing arguments that each of their witnesses plays a key role in the case, despite their professional rank or proximity to the alleged crimes. They will probably also have to push back against claims by the defense that Cohen, prosecutors' star witness, undermines their case because of his history of dishonesty, Honig said.\n\n\"The prosecution's argument will be that all the evidence interlocks and is corroborated and that you don't have to rely on any one witness's word on its own. They will say this is a documents case,\" he explained, going on to describe the various accounting documents presented during the trial.\n\n\"And they'll say, 'Michael Cohen's here to guide you through it, but you don't need to believe him -- everything he says is backed up'\" by evidence and other testimony, Honig said.\n\nDuring the trial, prosecutors walked jurors repeatedly through the 11 invoices, 12 vouchers and 11 checks -- the 34 documents that make up the falsified business records charges -- that were used to pay Cohen $420,000 in 2017, money that included the reimbursement for the $130,000 hush money payment \"grossed up\" to account for taxes.\n\nProsecutors showed jurors how Cohen sent the Trump Organization monthly invoices for $35,000, which were processed by the Trump company's controller so checks could be cut. Trump signed nine of the 11 checks. (The other two checks were paid from Trump's revocable trust and signed by former Trump Org. Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg and one of Trump's sons.)\n\nKaren Friedman Agnifilo, who served for a time as a top prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, said she expects the prosecution to present several themes in their closing arguments, including that most of the people who testified for their case were \"Trump witnesses ... who you would expect to be friendly to him.\"\n\nThe other theme, she said, could be: \"Look at the kind of people Trump values,\" with prosecutors arguing the former president chose to surround himself with people such as Cohen and Pecker, who were doing Trump's bidding ahead of the 2016 election.\n\n\"These are his people, he chose them. And he shouldn't now get the benefit of, 'Because they're flawed you can't rely on them,'\" prosecutors might argue, Agnifilo said.\n\n\"And even if you do not rely on them,\" she said, echoing Honig, \"the third theme is going to be, 'You don't have to, because everything is corroborated either by other witnesses or documents or records or Trump's own words.'\"\n\nThe length of the trial may not ultimately prove to be much of a challenge for jurors during their deliberations, Villalona said, since they were allowed to jot down notes during the proceedings and will be able to request some parts of the trial be read back to them.\n\n\"The good thing about New York is that they could request to have the whole trial read back to them and the judge will do that,\" she said. \"So if they forgot something David Pecker said on Day 1 or 2 of the trial, they can have that read back.\" She added that any of the exhibits put into evidence could also be sent to the jurors for them to take a closer look as they mull a verdict.\n\nStill, the closing arguments from each side will be carefully crafted to win not only a verdict in their favor, but also to mark each attorneys' place in the historic trial, Villalona mused.\n\n\"The prosecution and the defense is going to give the closing argument of their career,\" she said.\n\nCNN's Jeremy Herb, Kara Scannell and Lauren del Valle

Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 for her silence that October, using a home equity loan that he routed to Daniels' lawyer through a shell company created expressly for the transaction. Prosecutors say the crime was Trump authorizing a fake paper trail to disguise his repayment to Cohen as routine legal work.\n\nThe trial's last chapter follows almost five weeks of witness testimony that ranged from mundane cataloging of financial documents to uncomfortable details of an alleged sexual encounter in 2006 between Trump and Daniels that set in motion the events leading to this case.\n\nJurors saw Daniels spar with a Trump defense lawyer, Susan Necheles, over the adult entertainer's truthfulness, career choices and motives for claiming that Trump cheated with her on his wife, Melania Trump. They watched as defense lawyer Todd Blanche called Cohen a liar for testimony about contacting Trump to report that a deal with Daniels was imminent.\n\nThey also saw Trump's former White House communications director, Hope Hicks, weep on the stand, and -- before they were sent out of the courtroom by Merchan -- saw a Trump ally, Robert Costello, grumble \"ridiculous\" when the judge sustained a prosecutor's objection to part of his testimony.\n\nThey heard from almost two dozen witnesses in all, including two called as part of the defense team's comparatively brief rebuttal case. They did not hear from Trump, who exercised his right as a criminal defendant to not take the stand.\n\nIn between, jurors saw reams of texts, emails, and phone logs marshaled by both sides. They'll have to decide whether the documents and the testimony prove an illegal conspiracy to influence the 2016 presidential election using fraudulent accounting, or show nothing more than messy, behind-the-scenes maneuvering in a national political campaign.\n\nJurors got a week off to resume normal life while following Merchan's instructions to steer clear of trial coverage and commentary. The judicial blackout for jurors against exposure to the unprecedented case includes social media, where Trump was busy during the break proclaiming his innocence and painting the judge and the prosecutors as his tormentors. Among Trump's complaints on his Truth Social platform was Merchan giving the jurors a seven days off and not sequestering them. He also complained that it was the prosecution that was getting the last word in the case, even though that is standard procedure in a trial.\n\nTrump denies having sex with Daniels. He and his lawyers both say Cohen was in fact paid for ongoing work, and the non-disclosure agreement that Daniels signed was a legal means of protecting his campaign and his family from the embarrassment.", "source": {"uri": "deadline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_piccoli@deadline.com", "name": "Sean Piccoli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_conspiracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal conspiracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shell corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hope Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-disclosure agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2153374987.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

This is the beginning of the end of the Trump Trial. Today, Closing Arguments will begin in the Hush Money Trial in New York City. The question is: Will Lawfare win? Will an NYC jury vote to convict? Will Donald Trump go to jail? Will Judge Juan Merchan go diabolical and put Trump on House Arrest? When Lawfare and True Believers are involved, anything is possible.\n\nBack on April 15, 2024 when Jury Selection began, I kvetched that I wasn't sure what Donald Trump was charged with. The night before Closing Arguments in the Trump Trial the Washington Times wasn't too sure either:\n\n\"The most important decision that Judge Merchan made was his failure to reject the D.A.'s backdoor effort to enforce federal election law, which is unconstitutional,\" he said. \"If Merchan had reached the proper conclusion, he would have dismissed the entire indictment and the case would never have gone to trial.\"\n\nJoseph Moreno, a former federal prosecutor, agreed.\n\n\"Every significant legal and evidentiary ruling that Judge Merchan made in this case was to the advantage of the prosecution, starting with the very premise of the case,\" he said.\n\nHe said Mr. Bragg's \"bare-bones indictment\" listed 34 felony charges but did not specify what crime Mr. Trump was allegedly concealing. Mr. Bragg only offered a \"vague theory\" that Mr. Trump's accounting entries were done to hide federal and state crimes.\n\nIt's actually unConstitutional to not lay out the charges against the accused, according to the Sixth Amendment:\n\nIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\n\nWhen every day, you have promised your acolytes that the \"walls are closing in\" on Donald Trump, the charges don't matter a consarned bit. All that matters in the Trump Trial is that the testimony be salacious and sensational (Stormy, need I say more), the Regime Storyteller be breathlessly Joy(ful) every night and that the emotions of the faithful be kept at a high tempo (you've seen that).\n\nThe Washington Examiner lays out the three things coming up in the Trump Trial, but the Examiner doesn't seem to know the charges either:\n\nCLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nThe prosecution and the defense will have the chance to address the jury with their closing arguments. Both statements are expected to be long and will likely last the entire day as lawyers give hourslong summaries of the evidence and witness testimony.\n\nThe defense only needs to convince at least one juror that the prosecution has not proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, not prove Trump's innocence, to prevent a guilty verdict.\n\nAs such, in their closing arguments, the defense will likely try to find holes in the prosecution's case by countering porn star Stormy Daniels's testimony about her time with Trump. They will also likely try to distance the former president from knowing the exact details of the payments made to his former attorney Michael Cohen, who paid the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels.\n\nTrump is peeved that the Defense goes first in New York and I don't blame him.\n\nJURY INSTRUCTIONS\n\nFollowing closing arguments, Judge Juan Merchan, who is presiding over the case, will address the jury for about an hour to instruct them on what it can consider when deciding a verdict on the case.\n\nThe core of the case is the $130,000 hush money payment made to Daniels in 2016 to keep her quiet about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump.

Donald Trump?\n\nThere's reason to think the state will urge jurors to use their common sense and focus on the narrative that several witnesses corroborated. The defense, meanwhile, may have no choice but to sow as much confusion as possible, with its best shot resting on raising doubt about the relatively intricate nature of the legal charges.\n\nThough anything can happen in court, the state has already previewed what it will likely argue. When prosecutor Matthew Colangelo gave his opening statement last month, he told jurors:\n\nThe prosecutor explained:\n\nObviously, then, we expect Steinglass to walk the jury through the allegedly falsified documents themselves, which relate to former Trump fixer Michael Cohen's reimbursement for paying hush money to Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. But to prove the felony charges, the state must convince the jury unanimously that Trump not only caused their falsification but that he did so with intent to defraud that included an intent to commit or conceal another crime. (Trump has pleaded not guilty and has denied having sex with Daniels.)\n\nLegally, that requires jumping through some hoops. The main \"other crime\" that the prosecution has cited is a state crime that bars conspiring to promote or prevent a public official's election by \"unlawful means.\" That raises the question of what the \"unlawful means\" are. Those may include federal campaign finance violations of the sort that Cohen pleaded guilty to, in connection with the hush money scheme at the center of this state case, too. (The jury can't legally infer from Cohen's guilt that Trump, who was never charged federally, is therefore guilty as well.)\n\nThese somewhat sophisticated charges could become unwieldy in the hands of unskilled prosecutors. But Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office has simplified the narrative to Trump covering up an election conspiracy with false documents. In addition to the records, the state relies not only on testimony from Cohen -- a key witness, for sure -- but also from witnesses friendlier to Trump, like tabloid publisher David Pecker, who testified about the catch-and-kill scheme ahead of the 2016 election, and former Trump aide Hope Hicks, who said she didn't believe her boss when he told her that Cohen paid off Daniels out of the kindness of his heart.\n\nSteinglass will likely remind jurors that the case isn't about whether Cohen is a good guy -- and, in fact, that some of the ways in which Cohen is not a model citizen actually help show Trump's guilt, as in the Hicks example. Whatever Cohen's bias against Trump, it's harder to believe that there is some conspiracy against the defendant when testimony from Trump's allies -- even his own words from his books -- along with the documents align to support the state's narrative.\n\nThere's no single smoking gun, but there's no legal requirement for one. That's where common sense and corroboration come in.\n\nInterestingly, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche also cited common sense in his opening, telling jurors: \"Use your common sense. We're New Yorkers. That's why we're here.\" The problem is that the defense hasn't tried this case in a purely logical fashion. Trump's lawyers have contested things that they didn't need to -- like whether Trump had sex with Daniels -- and they put a witness on the stand in Robert Costello whose testimony, both in terms of what he said and how he said it, may have been more helpful to the prosecution.\n\nThat doesn't make this a slam-dunk case for prosecutors. It's always dangerous to guess what a jury will do (hence why I wrote that the case may have been won or lost at jury selection). And no matter how compelling a case the state has mounted, and no matter how blundering the defense has been at times, it's still the state's burden to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nUltimately, that may be the defense's best case. Trump's lawyers don't have to offer a compelling counternarrative of what happened -- though that might have been helpful -- because they can simply argue that the prosecution failed to prove its case. While they might have lost credibility in how they conducted Trump's defense, their best hope may lie in painting this whole thing as too legally complicated to prove beyond a reasonable doubt (hence why I wrote that how the judge instructs the jury on the law will be crucial as well).\n\nTrump has good lawyers. But their seeming blunders may have been at least partly due to their client insisting they do things a certain way. The success of the summation presented on his behalf may hinge partly on how much Trump is involved in this final phase of the trial -- and how much he leaves his fate to the professionals.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opening statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_boss", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crime boss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pecker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Pecker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hope Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tabloid journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/_OgINiJjvmPHjZTo84P8zg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MTg7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/msnbc_articles_593/69bbf1c81f9c7455276e3e59c1be8720", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Here are three things to look for as this historic trial wraps up.\n\nClosing arguments\n\nThe prosecution and the defense will have the chance to address the jury with their closing arguments. Both statements are expected to be long and will likely last the entire day as lawyers give hourslong summaries of the evidence and witness testimony.\n\nThe defense only needs to convince at least one juror that the prosecution has not proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, not prove Trump's innocence, to prevent a guilty verdict.\n\nAs such, in their closing arguments, the defense will likely try to find holes in the prosecution's case by countering porn star Stormy Daniels's testimony about her time with Trump. They will also likely try to distance the former president from knowing the exact details of the payments made to his former attorney Michael Cohen, who paid the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels.\n\nOver 19 days in court, the prosecution called 20 witnesses, resulting in testimony totaling over 50 hours. In closing, arguments will likely emphasize to the jury that they can trust the financial paperwork they have seen as evidence firsthand.\n\nThey will also likely lean into Daniels's testimony, as well as Cohen's, in which he said Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme.\n\nJury instructions\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nFollowing closing arguments, Judge Juan Merchan, who is presiding over the case, will address the jury for about an hour to instruct them on what it can consider when deciding a verdict on the case.\n\nThe core of the case is the $130,000 hush money payment made to Daniels in 2016 to keep her quiet about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump. The prosecution claims Trump falsified business records related to the payment, which they describe as election interference due to the payment happening mere weeks before the 2016 election.\n\nThe defense asked Merchan to consider the \"extraordinarily important\" nature of the case -- it is the first criminal trial of a former president -- when giving the jury instructions. The prosecution objected, and Merchan agreed it would not be in line with standard jury instructions.\n\n\"When you say it's a very important case, you're asking me to change the law, and I'm not going to do that,\" Merchan said.\n\nDeliberations\n\nA verdict could be reached as soon as Friday.

At the end of the trial comes the closing argument, which for Donald Trump begins Tuesday in Manhattan. The evidence Alvin Bragg's prosecutors have elicited during the trial has set them up well for a grand finale.\n\nEven before the case was filed, prosecutors were clearly thinking about the evidence they would need to prove that Trump falsified business records with the intent to conceal election and tax crimes. During seven weeks of trial, every exhibit and every witness is building toward this finale. Even jury selection was conducted with the end in mind. When prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked prospective jurors if they could accept the legal concept that a person can be convicted for murder by hiring a hit man to kill his wife, he was advocating for his theory of the case against Trump, who allegedly directed others do his dirty work in order to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. You can expect prosecutors to return to that theme in their closing argument.\n\nThe law is a little tricky in this case, with its 34 counts prosecutors must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. But overall, the law is favorable to the prosecution.\n\nFirst, the New York statute regarding business records requires proof that Trump knowingly caused business records to be falsified. Each of the 34 records, consisting of invoices, ledger entries and checks signed by Trump, will be considered separately. The jury need not find that Trump himself falsified the records, just that he caused someone else to do so.\n\nJust like hiring that hit man.\n\nAccording to the prosecution's case, these documents were falsified to make it appear that they were payments to Trump attorney Michael Cohen for legal services when, in fact, they were reimbursements for the $130,000 Cohen paid to silence adult actress Stormy Daniels and prevent her sexual encounter with Trump from becoming public. And, if the prosecution can prove that Trump knew that even one of the records was falsified, that is sufficient to overcome the first hurdle.\n\nSecond, the prosecution must prove that the records were falsified with intent to commit or conceal the commission of another crime. The prosecution will argue that this other crime may be any one of a number of violations of federal and state election laws and state tax law. And here is where the law is particularly favorable to the prosecution. New York law treats these predicate crimes as what is known as the \"manner and means\" of the commission of the crime rather than elements of the offense. That means the jury need not be unanimous in deciding which law was violated, so long as each juror believes that one of the laws was violated.\n\nBased on its pretrial filings and opening statement, I expect the prosecution will argue that Trump intended to violate several laws: accepting Cohen's contribution of $130,000, which exceeded the legal limit of $2,700; failing to report Cohen's payment as a campaign contribution; reimbursing Cohen in violation of prohibitions on \"straw\" donors; paying a portion of Cohen's reimbursement with Trump corporate funds, which is a prohibited source for campaign contributions; and falsely reporting Cohen's reimbursement as income on state tax returns. So long as the jury finds that Trump intended to conceal any one of these other crimes when he caused a false document to be made, the jury may find him guilty.\n\nIn proving these charges, the prosecution has two key obstacles to overcome. First is the credibility of its star witness. The defense no doubt will portray Cohen as a convicted liar who is out for vengeance against his former boss. Cohen admitted on the stand to lying and even to stealing from Trump while still in his employ. But the prosecution clearly began the trial with the end in mind when it comes to Cohen. Prosecutors strategically made Cohen their last witness, providing corroboration for his story even before he took the stand. As a result, the jurors have enough evidence to return a conviction, at least circumstantially, even if they tend to disregard Cohen's testimony because of his baggage. Prosecutors will also paint Cohen as Trump's guy, not theirs.\n\nTo overcome concerns about Cohen, the prosecution would be wise to hammer home two key pieces of evidence: the testimony of former AMI publisher David Pecker and the handwritten notes of Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg. Both men have strong credibility in light of their continued allegiance to Trump.\n\nPecker, the first witness in the case, testified that he attended a meeting with Trump and Cohen in August 2015, shortly after Trump announced his campaign for president, where they agreed to suppress negative stories that could be harmful to Trump's campaign. Although Weisselberg did not testify, his handwritten notes detailed exactly how Cohen would be reimbursed to conceal the payment to Daniels. This is compelling evidence that shows the way the records would be falsified to conceal the payments. Neither of those pieces of evidence requires the jury to believe the testimony of Cohen.\n\nThe second obstacle is the potential defense that Trump made the payment to Daniels and kept it secret not to influence the election, but to protect his family from the pain and embarrassment of the allegation. The law does not require the prosecution to prove that an intent to influence the campaign was the sole reason for the falsification of records, but it does require proof of what's called the \"indispensability test,\" that is, but for the campaign, the payment would not have been made.\n\nHere, even without regard to Cohen's testimony that the payment was made to protect the campaign, other evidence supports this conclusion. The story of the affair had existed since 2006, but it was only after Trump declared his campaign for president in 2015 that he paid to kill it. If the payment had been made to protect Trump's family, it would have been made long before then. Pecker's testimony about a similar hush money payment to Playboy model Karen McDougal regarding a 2005 relationship, made only after the campaign announcement, is further evidence that the payments were made for the purpose of influencing the campaign.\n\nPredicting how any particular jury will decide a case is always difficult because 12 individual jurors bring with them their life experiences and their unique worldviews. But the prosecution has positioned itself well throughout this trial, systematically building toward its final summation -- and a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opening statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pecker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Pecker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Weisselberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allen Weisselberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karen McDougal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family of Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.7kr_P4uiqj6pWHEKamRzw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02OTk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/msnbc_articles_593/442f46ff8e07d5a4712a1053d5379358", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-08-", "textStart": 4706, "textEnd": 4717}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

The defence called just two. Trump decided not to testify on his own behalf.\n\nThe trial now shifts to closing arguments, scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nAfter that, it will be up to 12 jurors to decide whether prosecutors have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified his company's business records as part of a broader effort to keep stories about marital infidelity from becoming public during his 2016 presidential campaign. He has pleaded not guilty and denies any wrongdoing.\n\nA conviction could come down to how the jurors interpret the testimony and which witnesses they find credible. The jury must be unanimous. The records involved include 11 checks sent to Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, as well as invoices and company ledger entries related to those payments.\n\nHere's a look at key trial witnesses and what they had to say:\n\nAs Trump sat feet away, the porn actor, writer and director, gave a detailed and at times graphic account of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump in Nevada in 2006. After they met at a celebrity golf tournament, she said, Trump invited her to dinner but then engaged her in conversation in his hotel room and startled her by stripping to his underwear while she was in the bathroom.\n\n\"I felt the room spin in slow motion. I felt the blood basically leave my hands and my feet,\" Daniels testified. \"I just thought, 'Oh, my God, what did I misread to get here?' Because the intention was pretty clear, somebody stripped down in their underwear and posing on the bed, like waiting for you.\"\n\nDaniels said Trump did not physically threaten her, but \"my own insecurities in that moment kept me from saying no\". Daniels said she kept in touch with Trump for about a year in hopes of appearing on his TV show The Apprentice, but it never happened.\n\nDaniels spoke about accepting US$15,000 ($24,000) for a magazine interview in 2011. The story was not printed at the time but ended up on a gossip website without her consent. Her lawyer, in consultation with Cohen, complained and had the story taken down.\n\nIn 2016, Daniels authorised her manager to shop her story again but found little interest until the release of the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" recording of Trump boasting about grabbing women's genitals without their permission.\n\nDaniels told the jury she accepted US$130,000 from Cohen in the final weeks of the election in exchange for a legal agreement to keep the claim to herself.\n\nTrump's lawyers grilled Daniels about her motivation, eliciting testimony that she hates the former Republican president. She pushed back on the defence's suggestion that her story was fabricated, saying if it was fiction, \"I would have written it to be a lot better.\"\n\nDaniels' testimony was among the most awaited in the trial. She had shared her story before, but this was the first time she testified about it in front of Trump. Trump's lawyers objected to much of Daniels' testimony and twice sought a mistrial, arguing that her feelings of a power imbalance with Trump and her blunt answers about the alleged sexual encounter should not have been put before the jury.\n\nA longtime Trump friend, Pecker was the publisher of the National Enquirer and chief executive of its parent company, American Media Inc, during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nPecker told the jury he agreed to be the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's campaign, looking out for damaging stories so they could be suppressed. He said he agreed to the role - and to a plan to publish positive stories about Trump and negative stories about his opponents - at an August 2015 meeting with Trump and Cohen.\n\n\"If there were any rumours in the marketplace about Mr Trump or his family or any negative stories that were coming out or anything that I heard overall,\" Pecker said, \"I would call Michael Cohen directly.\"\n\nHe said he told the National Enquirer's editor at the time, Dylan Howard, \"that we are going to try to help the campaign, and to do that, I want to keep this as quiet as possible.\"\n\nPecker testified that the company squashed one potential story by paying US$30,000 to a Trump Tower doorman. It paid US$150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a year-long affair with Trump.\n\nBut when Daniels came forward, Pecker said, he told Howard: \"I am not a bank, and we are not paying out any further disbursements or monies.\"\n\nInstead, he alerted Cohen that Daniels was shopping a story about Trump, and let the lawyer handle it. Trump denies having sex with either McDougal or Daniels.\n\nWhen the Wall Street Journal reported, just days before Election Day, that the Enquirer had paid McDougal, Pecker said Trump was upset, saying, \"How could this happen? I thought you had this under control?\"\n\n\"Our call ended very abruptly,\" Pecker said. \"He didn't say goodbye, which was very unusual.\"\n\nA lawyer known for representing people trying to sell celebrity sex tapes or other embarrassing information, Davidson negotiated the hush money deals for McDougal and Daniels. He gave jurors an inside look at the negotiations and helped corroborate Pecker's testimony.\n\nAt first, Davidson said, the National Enquirer was not interested in acquiring McDougal's story, saying she \"lacked documentary evidence\". But the tabloid eventually bought it at Pecker's behest. Davidson said he understood it would never be published because of \"an unspoken understanding that there was an affiliation\" between Pecker and Trump and that the National Enquirer would not run the story \"because it would hurt Donald Trump\".\n\nDavidson said he dealt directly with Cohen, never with Trump. While Cohen may not have explicitly stated he was working on Trump's behalf, Davidson said he felt the implication was clear.\n\nDavidson testified that about a month after Trump won the election, Cohen complained in a phone conversation that the president-elect hadn't yet paid him back for the US$130,000 payment to Daniels.\n\nCohen, a flawed but vital prosecution witness, testified about working with the National Enquirer to suppress negative stories about Trump. Cohen insisted he was working at Trump's direction when the lawyer helped orchestrate the payments to McDougal and Daniels.\n\nCohen testified that he kept the detail-oriented Trump updated on the payoffs.\n\nRegarding the decision to pay Daniels, Cohen said Trump felt it was best to buy her silence.\n\n\"He stated to me that he had spoken to some friends, some individuals, very smart people, and that it's US$130,000. You're like a billionaire. Just pay it. There is no reason to keep this thing out there. So do it.\n\n\"And he expressed to me: Just do it. Go meet up with Allen Weisselberg [the Trump Organisation's chief financial officer at the time] and figure this whole thing out.\"\n\nTestifying over the course of four days, Cohen told the jury he sought Trump's approval for the Daniels payment because \"everything required Mr Trump's sign-off. On top of that, I wanted the money back.\"\n\nWhen it briefly looked like the deal with Daniels might fall apart, Cohen said Trump got \"really angry with me\", saying, \"I thought you took care of this?\"\n\nCohen used money he borrowed money from a bank to make the US$130,000 payment to Daniels. Trump later reimbursed him. How Trump's company recorded those reimbursements - paid out of a Trump trust and personal accounts - is the core of the prosecution's case. Cohen said he submitted monthly invoices for a year for legal work he never actually performed, pursuant to a purported retainer agreement that he said did not exist.\n\nCohen said he discussed the reimbursement plan with Trump at the White House in February 2017. He recalled that Trump asked him whether he needed money, then promised a check soon would cover the first two months of invoices, totalling US$70,000.\n\nJurors also heard a secret recording Cohen made of a meeting he had with Trump in 2016 in which he briefed his boss about the plan to buy McDougal's story.\n\nTrump's lawyers have fought to discredit Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, past lies and his recollection of key details. On cross-examination, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump. Cohen also insisted he did not actually commit some crimes to which he pleaded guilty in 2018, including bank fraud and tax evasion. In that case, Cohen also pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and to campaign finance violations.\n\nCohen is the linchpin of the prosecution case, the only witness to testify that Trump had direct involvement in arranging his repayment. The verdict could hinge on whether jurors believe him.\n\nTrump's former campaign and White House communications director, Hicks testified about the frenetic days after the \"Access Hollywood\" leak as she and Trump's political advisers tried to contain the fallout. Hicks said she was \"very concerned\" about the impact of the tape and she subsequently asked Cohen to chase down a rumour about another potentially damaging recording, which turned out not to exist.\n\nHicks said that after the Wall Street Journal published its article detailing McDougal's hush money deal, Trump was concerned about how his wife, Melania, would take it.\n\n\"He wanted me to make sure the newspapers weren't delivered to their residence that morning.\"\n\nWhen news of the Daniels payoff started to emerge in 2018, Cohen initially told reporters he made the payment with his own money and without Trump's knowledge. Hicks said Trump also told her \"that Michael had paid this woman to protect him from a false allegation, and that Michael felt like it was his job to protect him, and that's what he was doing. And he did it out of the kindness of his own heart\".\n\nShe said, however, that it was \"out of character\" for Cohen to take such an action on his own.\n\n\"I didn't know Michael to be an especially charitable person or selfless person,\" Hicks said. \"He's the kind of person who seeks credit.\"\n\nTrump's lawyers called Costello, an attorney and ex-federal prosecutor, as their primary witness in a terse defence case aimed at undermining Cohen's credibility.\n\nAfter the FBI raided Cohen's home and office in 2018, Costello offered to become his lawyer. He told the jury that during their first meeting, Cohen paced anxiously, saying his life, and his family's life, had been \"shattered\".\n\n\"He said: 'I really want you to explain to me what my options are. What's my escape route?'\" Costello said.\n\nCostello said Cohen also insisted that he had made the Daniels deal on his own, that Trump \"knew nothing\" about it, and that Cohen had no incriminating information about Trump he could offer to federal prosecutors.\n\n\"I swear to God, Bob. I don't have anything on Donald Trump,\" Costello quoted Cohen as saying.\n\nProsecutors countered that Costello, who was close to Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, cosied up to Cohen to keep him loyal to Trump.\n\nIn one email, Costello told Cohen: \"Sleep well tonight. you have friends in high places,\" and relayed that there were \"some very positive comments about you from the White House\".\n\nCohen ultimately chose other lawyers.\n\nJeffrey McConney: The Trump Organisation's former controller testified about working with Weisselberg to set up payments to Cohen, including reimbursement for the US$130,000 payment to Daniels, a bonus and money for taxes.\n\nRhona Graff: Trump's former executive assistant testified about adding McDougal's and Daniels' contacts to Trump's contact list in the company's computer system, the latter listed simply as \"Stormy.\" Graff also said she had a \"vague recollection\" of seeing Daniels once at Trump Tower.\n\nDeborah Tarasoff: The Trump Organisation's accounts payable supervisor testified about processing the payments to Cohen, including receiving cheques that Trump had signed at the White House. Under defence questioning, she acknowledged permission to cut Cohen's cheques came not from Trump himself, but from Weisselberg and McConney.\n\nMadeleine Westerhout: Trump's White House secretary from 2017 to 2019 testified about Trump signing cheques, saying he sometimes would sign without reviewing them.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"},

He denies affairs with both women.\n\nProsecutors claim that the payment to Stormy Daniels was made through Trump's then attorney, Michael Cohen.\n\nThey also claim the payment to Daniels was an illegal campaign contribution because the payment was intended to silence Daniels and thereby influence the 2016 presidential election.\n\nCohen was later jailed for illegal campaign contributions, tax fraud and other charges. He is now an implacable opponent of Trump and they have attacked each other's characters on social media posts since the trial began.\n\nNewsweek sought email comment from Trump's attorney on Monday.\n\nKerwick told Newsweek that Cohen admitted to the jury that he had stolen from Trump and covered it up with fraudulent paperwork. She said that some of the jury may accept that Cohen acted alone in creating false records to hide hush money payments to Daniels.\n\nCohen admitted during his testimony that he stole from Trump's parent company, the Trump Organization.\n\nDuring Cohen's testimony, Trump attorney Todd Blanche questioned him about a payment to tech company Red Finch. Cohen paid the company $20,000 from the $50,000 he received from the Trump Organization for financial services, according to Newsweek reporter Katherine Fung, who has been covering the trial from the courtroom.\n\nCohen admitted to billing the Trump Organization for the full expense, even though he never paid Red Finch the entire amount. When Blanche asked Cohen if he stole from the Trump Organization, given the $20,000 Red Finch payment, Cohen answered, \"Yes, sir.\"\n\nKerwick said that it is not a crime to pay someone for their silence, which is a significant factor for the jury.\n\n\"It is not a crime to purchase someone's intellectual property rights or to have someone sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement.

Trump, who is almost certain to secure the Republican presidential nomination, is charged with falsifying business records related to paying the adult film star Stormy Daniels $130,000 for her silence about an alleged sexual liaison.\n\nProsecutors argue that the payments amount to election interference as Trump was running in the 2016 race for the White House at the time and seeking to cover up a potentially damaging scandal.\n\nBut as details of the case and Trump's liaison with Daniels have been brought before a Manhattan jury, they have had seemingly little impact on the 2024 race - where Trump still often narrowly leads Joe Biden in head-to-head polls and is performing strongly in the swings states that are crucial to victory.\n\nTrump denies all the charges.\n\nThe trial has played out in remarkable scenes where Trump has been in court and largely kept off the campaign trial, except at weekends and some events in and around New York City. Despite admonishments from the court, he has continued to rail against his prosecutors, and Judge Juan Merchan, on social media, labelling the trial as a \"witch hunt\".\n\nCentral to the case is the testimony of Trump's former lawyer and once-feared fixer Michael Cohen. Cohen gave vital evidence for the role that Trump played in the alleged hush-money scheme, but was also brutally grilled by Trump's lawyers for his previous history of lying and his evident dislike of his former boss and desire to see him behind bars.\n\nWhat weight the jury places on the reliability of Cohen's testimony is likely to decide the case one way or the other. If found guilty, Trump could face the prospect of jail, though that is mostly seen as unlikely. Any guilty verdict would also almost certainly trigger a lengthy series of appeals.\n\nTrump also faces three other criminal trials: one for trying to sway the 2020 election in Georgia, another for his conduct around the January 6 attack on the Capitol and a third one related to his treatment of sensitive documents after he left the White House. However, all three have been seriously delayed and none are seen as likely to conclude - or even start - before November's presidential election.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Witch-hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/d9500d191d7efa1ba1018b2bfaefc0d6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 2160, "textEnd": 2169}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

But that will change after the jury reaches its verdict.\n\nThe exact wording is still being worked out but Biden will speak about the trial from the White House to show his statement isn't political, sources told Politico.\n\nClosing arguments in Trump's trial begin on Tuesday and there could be a verdict as early as this week.\n\nIf the jury convicts Trump, Biden's re-election team will argue this shows Trump is unsuited for office. It may even refer to him online as 'Convicted Felon Donald Trump' - a move designed to infuriate the former president.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who has been silent on Donald Trump's trial, will speak about it after the jury reaches its verdict\n\nA conviction does not require jail time. Judge Juan Merchan picks the punishment, which could include a fine, probation or a jail sentence. Trump would be expected to appeal.\n\nBut, Biden's team is also preparing for an acquittal or hung jury, expecting a barrage of attacks from Trump and his Republican supporters.\n\nIn either of those scenarios, Trump is likely to portray himself as having beaten an improper political prosecution. He has long claimed to be a victim of a political witch hunt.\n\nNot matter the verdict, Biden will argue the system works and the legal process should be respected.\n\nTrump's trial is in the final stages after more than a month of testimony.\n\nProsecutors and his defense team will each present their closing arguments on Tuesday.\n\nThe prosecution will argue that, in the weeks ahead of the 2016 election, Trump and his-then fixer Michael Coehn covered up a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels, who said she'd had an extramarital affair with Trump in 2006. Trump denies the affair.\n\nTrump is accused of falsifying business documents tied to that payment and faces 34 felony charges.\n\nHis lawyers are expected to argue that the prosecutions' top witnesses - Cohen and Daniels - cannot be trusted.\n\nHush money payments are not inherently illegal, the defense stated throughout trial, and Trump's side also claims the former president simply didn't want his wife Melania embarrassed.\n\nDonald Trump is accused of falsifying business documents tied to that payment and faces 34 felony charges\n\nThe 12 jurors could head into their closed-door deliberations as early as Wednesday.\n\nThe verdict could take anywhere from hours to days to reach.\n\nWhatever they decide, it will mark the first time a jury has ruled on criminal charges against a U.S. president, past or present.\n\nTrump's case has been a delicate scenario for Biden and his team to handle.\n\nBiden's son Hunter faces his own trials. Proceedings are set to begin in Delaware on June 3 on gun charges against the president's son.\n\nSpecial counsel David Weiss alleges that Hunter Biden unlawfully purchased and kept a Colt Cobra 388PL revolver for 11 days and made false statements on a form used for gun purchases, claiming he was not an unlawful drug user.\n\nHunter also has been indicted on nine tax-related charges.\n\nBiden has stayed away from both men's trials to avoid perceptions of interference.\n\nPresident Biden faces another dilemma with son Hunter Biden's trial\n\nAdditionally, neither Biden's re-election team nor political pundits see a Trump guilty verdict as having much of an impact on the presidential campaign.\n\nMany believe voters are not paying much attention to the Trump trial. And Trump's loyal MAGA supporters are not expected to be swayed.\n\nA recent CBS News/YouGov poll found that about three quarters of Americans report having heard or read at least some about the trial. But they were split almost 50-50 as to whether or not Trump is guilty.\n\nAnd a PBS Newshour/NPR/Marist poll in early May found that 55 percent of Americans said they weren't paying much attention to the case at all.\n\nTrump also faces more than 50 charges in three other indictments.

One-fifty?\" Trump asks his attorney and \"fixer,\" Cohen, just two months before the 2016 election. \"Pay with cash,\" Trump then instructs.\n\nThis phone conversation, secretly recorded by Cohen, catches Trump calling the shots as the two men discuss financing for a $150,000 hush-money payment. The hush money was meant to keep voters in the dark about former Playboy model Karen McDougal's claim -- denied by Trump -- of a nearly yearlong affair with the then-Apprentice star in 2006.\n\nWhy is this taped Trump-Cohen phone call, labeled People's Exhibit 246, important? Because it makes it impossible for Trump to say he had no role in hush-money financing.\n\nProsecutors can be expected to argue that this recording directly connects Trump to an illegal campaign conspiracy.\n\nAs they alleged in opening statements, this conspiracy influenced the election by purchasing the silence of McDougal and -- for $130,000 more -- of porn star Daniels. Trump's indictment alleges he falsified 34 business records throughout 2017, his first year in office, to cover up Daniels' hush money.\n\nThe Trump-Cohen phone call shows Trump in the pilot's seat of the conspiracy, prosecutors will argue. Or, at the very least, he's in the cabin with Cohen. Also in the conspiracy cabin: Trump's then-CFO, Allen Weisselberg, and Pecker, the then-National Enquirer publisher, both of whom are name-dropped in the tape.\n\nPeople's 248 is a transcript of this important call, available here. The actual audio can be heard here.\n\n2. *** THIRTY-FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND NO CENTS***********\n\nNine times throughout his first year in office, Trump signed checks that are now key exhibits in the hush-money trial. Each was drawn on his personal bank account. Each paid Cohen $35,000 as a \"retainer.\"\n\nAnd each check, prosecutors say, is a felony-level falsified business record. These nine checks are our second smoking gun.\n\nAccording to his indictment, the checks reimbursed Cohen in monthly installments for the $130,000 wired to Daniels just 11 days before the 2016 election, along with some other money Cohen was due.\n\nWhy are these hand-signed checks so important?\n\nTrump can argue that he never saw or handled most of the 34 business records that prosecutors say he \"caused\" to be falsified to hide the Daniels hush money, records that include a year's worth of bogus Cohen \"retainer\" invoices and entries in the Trump Org business ledgers.\n\nBut Trump cannot claim he never saw or handled these nine checks.\n\nAnd that $35,000 amount on each check?\n\nThat amount matches exactly the $35,000 figure that Trump's then-chief financial officer, Weisselberg, landed on when calculating Cohen's monthly reimbursements -- as shown in People's Exhibit 35, described below.\n\n3. \"PAY ... ASAP ... OK\"\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche will likely argue on Tuesday that Trump was too busy running the country to have bothered with the nitty-gritty of falsifying documents. Trump was especially distracted -- even \"multi-tasking\" -- when he signed each of those nine checks, the defense has already suggested.\n\nBut People's 71 -- a January 2017 invoice from the Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, New York -- strongly suggests otherwise. See People's 71 in its entirety here.\n\nWhy is this evidence -- our third smoking gun -- so important?\n\nThe invoice shows Trump personally signing off on the golf club's $6,974.01 annual dues and \"food minimum.\"\n\nIt's proof that Trump continued to pay close attention to his personal spending in 2017.\n\nTrump's former White House executive assistant, Madeleine Westerhout, showed jurors this exhibit when she took the stand earlier this month, delivering a big blow to the \"multi-tasking\" defense.\n\nWesterhout also showed jurors emails revealing that, in June 2017, she got Trump's advance approval for the purchase, with his money, of a $650 Tiffany picture frame. Trump wanted to display a photo of his mother, Westerhout said, on the credenza behind his desk in the Oval Office.\n\nThe frame was 15% off, Trump was told before he approved its purchase.\n\nSo even in the White House, we have Trump signing off on golf fees and picture frames.\n\nThis proven micromanaging makes it easier for prosecutors to argue that Trump was paying attention when he signed $35,000 of his own cash over to Cohen -- who testified that his actual legal work as personal attorney to the president amounted to less than 20 hours in all of 2017.\n\n4. The single most important piece of evidence in the case\n\nWe now turn to the most important evidence in the case -- People's 35, our fourth smoking gun.\n\nThis is an October 2016 First Republic bank statement. Both Cohen and Weisselberg scribbled calculations on it.\n\nWhy is this bank statement important?\n\nBecause on just one page, it records Cohen wiring the $130,000 in hush money to Daniels' attorney just 11 days before the 2016 election.\n\nBut there's more: it also shows the Weisselbergian math behind Cohen's $35,000 hush-money reimbursement checks.\n\nAnd the two sets of handwriting -- Cohen's and Weisselberg's -- scrawled across the bottom show the alleged conspiring of Trump's closest lieutenants at the time: his fixer and his top numbers man.\n\nPeople's 35 does not have Trump's fingerprints on it. Jurors have only Cohen's word that Trump saw it. But prosecutors can argue Tuesday that it clinches the case for conspiracy and records-falsification -- subject to connection to Trump himself.\n\nIt will be up to jurors to decide if Trump would have blindly affixed his signature to nine $35,000 checks if he really believed they were \"retainers\" as labeled -- and if he really believed he was paying a lawyer who hardly worked for him anymore.\n\nIt will also be up to jurors to decide if Cohen and Weisselberg would have cooked Trump's books -- hiding the true nature of what Cohen was being paid for -- without the knowledge and approval of Trump, the micromanaging boss footing the bill.\n\nRead Business Insider's deep dive on People's 35 here.\n\n5. \"Sleep well tonight, you have friends in high places.\"\n\nFast forward to 2018. Trump has been in office for a year and, thanks to The Wall Street Journal, the world now knows about his porn-star hush-money scandal.\n\nIn early April, the FBI raided Cohen's office and apartment, seizing evidence it would later use to successfully prosecute him for his illegal $130,000 contribution to his boss's campaign.\n\nThroughout April, Trump worried Cohen would \"flip\" against him, prosecutors argue. So Trump, they say, authorized a communications back channel, whereby Cohen could talk to attorney Robert Costello, who could relay messages to his buddy Rudy Giuliani, then Trump's lawyer.\n\nThis alleged Trump-to-Giuliani-to-Costello-to-Cohen back channel is evident in this prosecution exhibit, People's 205. This is the infamous \"Friends in high places\" email that would be featured in the \"obstruction\" section of the Mueller Report.\n\nWhy is this April 21, 2018 email -- People's Exhibit 205 -- important?\n\nIt suggests the nearly invisible hand of Trump, covertly pulling strings to keep Cohen from cooperating with the justice department and spilling any election conspiracy beans.\n\n6. \"He will make sure to tell the President\"\n\nIn another email from that same day, People's Exhibit 204, Cohen is assured of Giuliani's gratitude for \"this back channel of communication\" to Trump.\n\nThis email, our gun number 6, again shows the covert, thrice-removed hand of Trump, pulling strings.\n\n\"I just spoke to Rudy Giuliani and told him I was on your team,\" Costello tells Cohen in the email.\n\n\"Rudy was thrilled and said this could not be a better situation for the President or you. He asked me if it was OK to call the President and (then-Trump lawyer) Jay Sekelow and I said fine,\" the email continues.\n\nGiuliani \"asked me to tell you that he knows how tough this is on your family and he will make sue [CQ] to tell the President,\" the email says.\n\n7. \"From which he entered into, through reimbursement...\"\n\nA week later, on May 3, 2018, the hush-money scandal was still in the news, and Trump posted what he may have believed would be a self-exonerating tweet.\n\nWhy is this panicked-sounding, somewhat garbled tweet important?\n\nIt's Trump acknowledging what prosecutors allege in those 34 felony falsification counts: That he knew Cohen's monthly retainer checks were not for legal fees at all.\n\nInstead, they were \"reimbursement\" (Trump's word) for \"a non-disclosure agreement\" (Trump's word again) -- also known as hush money.\n\nTrump tweets this admission just five months after signing his last $35,000 \"retainer\" check to Cohen.\n\n8. \"Mr. Trump fully reimbursed Mr. Cohen in 2017\"\n\nTwelve days later, on May 15, 2018, Trump affixed his black-Sharpie signature to a routine government disclosure form called an \"Executive Branch Personnel Public Financial Disclosure Report.\"\n\nProsecutors call this document People's Exhibit 81. It's the then-president's mandatory disclosure of his assets and liabilities.\n\nUnder \"Liablities\" -- which is the section where Trump must list the money he's borrowed -- Trump certifies that in 2017, he \"fully reimbursed\" Cohen an interest-free sum of between $100,000 and $250,000.\n\nWhy is this footnote on page 45 important? Prosecutors say it reflects Trump's admission that he repaid Cohen's $130,000 hush-money outlay.\n\nIn closing arguments Tuesday, prosecutors may well put People's 81 back on the courtroom display screens.\n\nThey'll scroll past Trump's signature to page 45 and say the footnote proves the then-president knew he was reimbursing Cohen for hush money throughout 2017 -- not paying legal fees as his falsified business records claimed.\n\n9. The AMI non-prosecution agreement\n\nOn September 21, 2018, lawyers for Pecker -- then the National Enquirer's publisher -- signed a non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors in Manhattan.\n\nThis is the Department of Justice agreeing not to prosecute the Enquirer's parent company, AMI, for illegal 2016 contributions \"to the campaign of a candidate for President of the United States.\"\n\nIn return, Pecker and AMI's other officers and employees agreed to cooperate in the feds' investigation.\n\nWhy is this non-prosecution agreement -- People's Exhibit 182 -- our ninth smoking gun?\n\nIt shows Pecker admitting to same kind of federal campaign-contribution offense -- in his case, for the $150,000 in hush money that silenced McDougal on Trump's behalf -- that's at the center of the falsification case.\n\nThe jury also knows that Cohen, too, pleaded guilty to this same offense: making an illegally high campaign contribution on Trump's behalf, in his case the $130,000 paid to Daniels.\n\nJurors will be instructed by the judge on Tuesday that they cannot view the AMI agreement and Cohen's guilty plea as proof that Trump, too, violated federal campaign finance law -- but these are tough bells to unring.\n\nRead Business Insider's deep-dive story on how the Federal Election Campaign Act is a central element of Trump's charges.\n\n10. Finally, a smoking micro-gun\n\nFinally, here's a smoking micro-gun with some assembly required.\n\nOnce assembled, it bolsters Cohen's testimony that shortly after 12 noon on October 26, 2017, Trump gave his final approval to the hush-money payment.\n\nPeople's 373 is a bank document showing that on that day, First Republic Bank employee Melissa Duran processed Cohen's request for a $131,000 advance on his home-equity loan.\n\nPeople's 374 is an email showing Duran passing this request to her loan servicing department at 12:22 p.m.\n\nPeople's 349 is a call log showing that on that day, Cohen called Trump at 12:26 p.m. and Trump called Cohen at 12:34 p.m. Their two phones were connected for a total of 4 minutes and 29 seconds.\n\nCohen testified that immediately after these calls with Trump, he took the elevator down from his Trump Organization offices at Trump Tower.\n\nThen, he told jurors, he walked across Fifth Avenue to his bank, to finalize the $131,000 transfer out of his home-equity loan, money he'd then wire to Daniels' lawyer the next day.\n\n\"Do you have any doubt in your mind that Mr. Trump gave you the final sign-off to go ahead and make the payment before you went to the bank to complete that?\" prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asked Cohen during redirect examination.\n\n\"No doubt,\" Cohen answered.\n\n\"Would you have paid Stormy Daniels the $130,000 had Mr. Trump not signed off?\"\n\n\"No, ma'am,\" Cohen answered.\n\n\"Why not?\" the prosecutor asked.\n\n\"Because I wanted to ensure that I was going to get my funds back,\" Cohen answered.\n\nRead the

But jurors may not need to believe Michael Cohen, David Pecker, or Stormy Daniels to convict Trump. Here are 10 persuasive pieces of evidence that practically speak for themselves.\n\nDuring Tuesday's closing arguments in the Donald Trump hush-money trial, jurors are sure to hear a lot about the motives and credibility of key prosecution witnesses Michael Cohen, David Pecker, and Stormy Daniels.\n\nBut jurors may not need to believe these witnesses to convict Trump.\n\nHere are 10 stand-alone pieces of evidence that practically speak for themselves.\n\n1. \"So, what do we got to pay for this?\"\n\n\"So, what do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump asks his attorney and \"fixer,\" Cohen, just two months before the 2016 election. \"Pay with cash,\" Trump then instructs.\n\nThis phone conversation, secretly recorded by Cohen, catches Trump calling the shots as the two men discuss financing for a $150,000 hush-money payment. The hush money was meant to keep voters in the dark about former Playboy model Karen McDougal's claim -- denied by Trump -- of a nearly yearlong affair with the then-Apprentice star in 2006.\n\nWhy is this taped Trump-Cohen phone call, labeled People's Exhibit 246, important? Because it makes it impossible for Trump to say he had no role in hush-money financing.\n\nProsecutors can be expected to argue that this recording directly connects Trump to an illegal campaign conspiracy.\n\nAs they alleged in opening statements, this conspiracy influenced the election by purchasing the silence of McDougal and -- for $130,000 more -- of porn star Daniels. Trump's indictment alleges he falsified 34 business records throughout 2017, his first year in office, to cover up Daniels' hush money.\n\nThe Trump-Cohen phone call shows Trump in the pilot's seat of the conspiracy, prosecutors will argue. Or, at the very least, he's in the cabin with Cohen. Also in the conspiracy cabin: Trump's then-CFO, Allen Weisselberg, and Pecker, the then-National Enquirer publisher, both of whom are name-dropped in the tape.\n\nPeople's 248 is a transcript of this important call, available here. The actual audio can be heard here.\n\n2. *** THIRTY-FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND NO CENTS***********\n\nNine times throughout his first year in office, Trump signed checks that are now key exhibits in the hush-money trial. Each was drawn on his personal bank account. Each paid Cohen $35,000 as a \"retainer.\"\n\nAnd each check, prosecutors say, is a felony-level falsified business record. These nine checks are our second smoking gun.\n\nAccording to his indictment, the checks reimbursed Cohen in monthly installments for the $130,000 wired to Daniels just 11 days before the 2016 election, along with some other money Cohen was due.\n\nWhy are these hand-signed checks so important?\n\nTrump can argue that he never saw or handled most of the 34 business records that prosecutors say he \"caused\" to be falsified to hide the Daniels hush money, records that include a year's worth of bogus Cohen \"retainer\" invoices and entries in the Trump Org business ledgers.\n\nBut Trump cannot claim he never saw or handled these nine checks.\n\nAnd that $35,000 amount on each check?\n\nThat amount matches exactly the $35,000 figure that Trump's then-chief financial officer, Weisselberg, landed on when calculating Cohen's monthly reimbursements -- as shown in People's Exhibit 35, described below.\n\n3. \"PAY ... ASAP ... OK\"\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche will likely argue on Tuesday that Trump was too busy running the country to have bothered with the nitty-gritty of falsifying documents. Trump was especially distracted -- even \"multi-tasking\" -- when he signed each of those nine checks, the defense has already suggested.\n\nBut People's 71 -- a January 2017 invoice from the Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, New York -- strongly suggests otherwise. See People's 71 in its entirety here.\n\nWhy is this evidence -- our third smoking gun -- so important?\n\nThe invoice shows Trump personally signing off on the golf club's $6,974.01 annual dues and \"food minimum.\"\n\nIt's proof that Trump continued to pay close attention to his personal spending in 2017.\n\nTrump's former White House executive assistant, Madeleine Westerhout, showed jurors this exhibit when she took the stand earlier this month, delivering a big blow to the \"multi-tasking\" defense.\n\nWesterhout also showed jurors emails revealing that, in June 2017, she got Trump's advance approval for the purchase, with his money, of a $650 Tiffany picture frame. Trump wanted to display a photo of his mother, Westerhout said, on the credenza behind his desk in the Oval Office.\n\nThe frame was 15% off, Trump was told before he approved its purchase.\n\nSo even in the White House, we have Trump signing off on golf fees and picture frames.\n\nThis proven micromanaging makes it easier for prosecutors to argue that Trump was paying attention when he signed $35,000 of his own cash over to Cohen -- who testified that his actual legal work as personal attorney to the president amounted to less than 20 hours in all of 2017.\n\n4. The single most important piece of evidence in the case\n\nWe now turn to the most important evidence in the case -- People's 35, our fourth smoking gun.\n\nThis is an October 2016 First Republic bank statement. Both Cohen and Weisselberg scribbled calculations on it.\n\nWhy is this bank statement important?\n\nBecause on just one page, it records Cohen wiring the $130,000 in hush money to Daniels' attorney just 11 days before the 2016 election.\n\nBut there's more: it also shows the Weisselbergian math behind Cohen's $35,000 hush-money reimbursement checks.\n\nAnd the two sets of handwriting -- Cohen's and Weisselberg's -- scrawled across the bottom show the alleged conspiring of Trump's closest lieutenants at the time: his fixer and his top numbers man.\n\nPeople's 35 does not have Trump's fingerprints on it. Jurors have only Cohen's word that Trump saw it. But prosecutors can argue Tuesday that it clinches the case for conspiracy and records-falsification -- subject to connection to Trump himself.\n\nIt will be up to jurors to decide if Trump would have blindly affixed his signature to nine $35,000 checks if he really believed they were \"retainers\" as labeled -- and if he really believed he was paying a lawyer who hardly worked for him anymore.\n\nIt will also be up to jurors to decide if Cohen and Weisselberg would have cooked Trump's books -- hiding the true nature of what Cohen was being paid for -- without the knowledge and approval of Trump, the micromanaging boss footing the bill.\n\nRead Business Insider's deep dive on People's 35 here.\n\n5. \"Sleep well tonight, you have friends in high places.\"\n\nFast forward to 2018.

The AMI non-prosecution agreement\n\nOn September 21, 2018, lawyers for Pecker -- then the National Enquirer's publisher -- signed a non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors in Manhattan.\n\nThis is the Department of Justice agreeing not to prosecute the Enquirer's parent company, AMI, for illegal 2016 contributions \"to the campaign of a candidate for President of the United States.\"\n\nIn return, Pecker and AMI's other officers and employees agreed to cooperate in the feds' investigation.\n\nWhy is this non-prosecution agreement -- People's Exhibit 182 -- our ninth smoking gun?\n\nIt shows Pecker admitting to same kind of federal campaign-contribution offense -- in his case, for the $150,000 in hush money that silenced McDougal on Trump's behalf -- that's at the center of the falsification case.\n\nThe jury also knows that Cohen, too, pleaded guilty to this same offense: making an illegally high campaign contribution on Trump's behalf, in his case the $130,000 paid to Daniels.\n\nJurors will be instructed by the judge on Tuesday that they cannot view the AMI agreement and Cohen's guilty plea as proof that Trump, too, violated federal campaign finance law -- but these are tough bells to unring.\n\nRead Business Insider's deep-dive story on how the Federal Election Campaign Act is a central element of Trump's charges.\n\n10. Finally, a smoking micro-gun\n\nFinally, here's a smoking micro-gun with some assembly required.\n\nOnce assembled, it bolsters Cohen's testimony that shortly after 12 noon on October 26, 2017, Trump gave his final approval to the hush-money payment.\n\nPeople's 373 is a bank document showing that on that day, First Republic Bank employee Melissa Duran processed Cohen's request for a $131,000 advance on his home-equity loan.\n\nPeople's 374 is an email showing Duran passing this request to her loan servicing department at 12:22 p.m.\n\nPeople's 349 is a call log showing that on that day, Cohen called Trump at 12:26 p.m. and Trump called Cohen at 12:34 p.m. Their two phones were connected for a total of 4 minutes and 29 seconds.\n\nCohen testified that immediately after these calls with Trump, he took the elevator down from his Trump Organization offices at Trump Tower.\n\nThen, he told jurors, he walked across Fifth Avenue to his bank, to finalize the $131,000 transfer out of his home-equity loan, money he'd then wire to Daniels' lawyer the next day.\n\n\"Do you have any doubt in your mind that Mr. Trump gave you the final sign-off to go ahead and make the payment before you went to the bank to complete that?\" prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asked Cohen during redirect examination.\n\n\"No doubt,\" Cohen answered.\n\n\"Would you have paid Stormy Daniels the $130,000 had Mr. Trump not signed off?\"\n\n\"No, ma'am,\" Cohen answered.\n\n\"Why not?\" the prosecutor asked.\n\n\"Because I wanted to ensure that I was going to get my funds back,\" Cohen answered.\n\nRead the

The judge will lay out the particulars of the law in question, often defining esoteric legal terminology, in order to guide the jury into an understanding of what would constitute a violation of said law.\n\nJurors are instructed on how to apply these guidelines to the evidence presented during trial -- which in this case, includes the testimony of 20 witnesses and over 250 exhibits -- to determine whether the prosecution has proven their case against the defendant.\n\nHow Judge Juan Merchan instructs the jury -- and how the jury understands those instructions -- will be critical to how this historic case is decided, experts told ABC News.\n\n\"I can't overemphasize the importance of the judge's instructions -- jurors cling very tightly to the roadmap the judge provides,\" Cheryl Bader, a professor at Fordham Law, told ABC News. \"The verdict is not just a determination of what facts the jury believes, it is the intersection of facts and law together.\"\n\nIn a pre-charge conference Tuesday, during which the prosecution and defense sparred over what should be included in jury instructions, Merchan said he would ensure the instructions were clear and comprehensible. \"We want to make it as easy as possible for the jury,\" he said.\n\nMerchan will instruct jurors that they must find Trump guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" in order to convict. As with any criminal case, the burden of proof lies with the prosecution -- meaning prosecutors must prove Trump is guilty, and the defense does not have to prove Trump's innocence.\n\nMerchan is also likely to inform jurors that they must only consider evidence presented during the trial, and not allow bias or sympathy to sway their decision. They will also be instructed they cannot hold Trump's decision not to testify against him.\n\nTrump is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records -- a crime that can be tried as a misdemeanor, but may be elevated to a felony when the act was done in an effort to cover up an underlying crime. Prosecutors have suggested Trump violated election laws by concealing a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in order to protect damaging information about himself from coming out ahead of the 2016 presidential race. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe crime-within-a-crime nature of the felony charge means instructing the jury may be a complicated task. In a motion earlier in the case, Merchan ruled against requiring prosecutors to specifically identify the underlying crime they believe Trump committed -- but jurors will need to have a solid grasp on what that alleged underlying crime is in order to decide whether Trump is guilty of the felony charges.\n\nThe prosecution and the defense have disagreed over what exactly the jury must find proven in order to convict. Defense attorney Emil Bove has argued they must find Trump acted willfully in order to be found guilty, saying \"there must be a criminal object\" of the alleged conspiracy to hide damaging information from voters ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nProsecutors argued the jury should be told that Trump could be convicted because he caused false entries into the Trump Organization's general ledger through controller Jeff McConney and his deputy Deb Tarasoff, both of whom testified at trial. The defense suggested in opening statements that Trump could be acquitted since he himself did not enter accounting records but left it to others.\n\n\"Explaining the law around the specific charges here will likely be more challenging and contentious than in a typical assault or robbery case because of the way this case is charged,\" Bader said. \"It will be interesting to see what federal or state election law is explained to the jurors in the judge's charge.\"\n\nMuch of the case will hinge on whose story jurors believe -- do they trust Trump, whose attorneys say he paid the hush money not to influence the election, but to protect his family and reputation? Or do they believe former Trump fixer Michael Cohen and the other witnesses who support his claims? The defense has painted the prosecution's star witness as a serial liar with a vendetta against the former president.\n\nBut how the jury approaches the issue of credibility is inherently subjective and impossible to predict.\n\n\"They can choose to accept all, part or none of the testimony of any witness -- as they are the sole arbiters of credibility,\" Bader said.\n\nIf Trump is found guilty, the defense can be expected to appeal the conviction, in which case jury instructions can play a pivotal role.\n\n\"Because a judge's charging decisions rest on determinations of law, they are fertile ground for appeal,\" Bader said.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_law", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Procedural law"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burden of proof (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_instructions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury instructions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordham_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fordham University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_ledger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General ledger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/c73f3554-60c2-4c3d-afbb-978a2e79ac07/judge-juan-merchan-rt-jt-240524_1716580336094_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Trial's Historic Closing Arguments Will Be A 'Tale Of Two Cases'", "body": "The New York jury in Donald Trump's hush money trial is returning to court after a week-long hiatus for closing arguments that will set the stage for historic deliberations.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers on Tuesday will give dueling takes on the evidence and testimony presented over nearly five weeks. The jurors, who are expected to get the case as soon as Wednesday, could reach a verdict in a matter of days.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 payment on the eve of the 2016 election. The case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg may hinge on whether jurors believe Trump had an intent to defraud as well as conceal other crimes, namely election law and tax violations.\n\nWhile the false-records charges are \"simple and easy to understand,\" turning those misdemeanors into felonies using New York election law along with other legal theories is more complicated, said Jennifer Rodgers, a former federal prosecutor.\n\nThe defense's closing argument will cast the issue as \"muddled, confusing, and full of reasonable doubt,\" Rodgers said, while prosecutors \"will want to cast their enhancement theory as easy to understand and well supported by overwhelming evidence.\"\n\n\"It will be a tale of two cases, for sure.\"\n\nThe case is one of four criminal prosecutions Trump is facing as he campaigns to return to the White House, including state and federal charges over his failed attempt to overturn the result of the 2020 election. The presumptive Republican nominee has denied wrongdoing in all the cases, claiming without evidence that they're part of a coordinated conspiracy against him by Democrats.\n\nThe defense and prosecution in the hush money trial rested their cases early last week, but Justice Juan Merchan delayed closing arguments so they would not be split from deliberations by the holiday weekend and previously scheduled days off.\n\nMerchan has said closing arguments are expected to last all day Tuesday and could bleed into Wednesday. The judge must also give jurors so-called charging instructions to explain the law and aid their deliberations. Merchan told jurors they'll start deliberating \"hopefully, at some point on Wednesday.\"\n\nClosing arguments are important for prosecutors because a small number of witnesses \"may have overshadowed the rest of the evidence,\" according to Rodgers. She said the government must \"re-acquaint jurors with all of the evidence in the case, not just the unforgettable moments.\"\n\nProsecutors, who have the burden of proof, will argue that their case was overwhelmingly supported by multiple witnesses along with a trove of emails, text messages, business records and other pieces of evidence.\n\nBragg's team relied heavily on its star witness, former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who made the $130,000 payment and was allegedly reimbursed by Trump in monthly installments throughout 2017.\n\nCohen gave jurors a first-hand account of every stage of the alleged hush money scheme, from its inception at a 2015 Trump Tower meeting to efforts to deceive the press and federal election regulators when news of the scheme leaked out three years later.\n\nMuch of Cohen's testimony was backed by other witnesses or documents. Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified he met with Trump and Cohen at Trump Tower in 2015 to discuss how he could use his tabloid to help Trump win the White House.\n\nOne person who didn't testify was Trump, but his team, led by Todd Blanche, will seek to sow doubt in the mind of at least one juror. His closing argument will likely focus heavily on Cohen's credibility, which Blanche damaged during a withering cross-examination.\n\nBlanche will remind jurors of Cohen's well-documented perjury as well as testimony at the trial that the defense says turned out to be false.\n\nBased on arguments last week, Blanche can also be expected to hammer home the notion that prosecutors failed to prove Trump had any intent to defraud and that there was no conspiracy to violate election laws.", "source": {"uri": "matzav.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "matzav.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pecker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Pecker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_meeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trump Tower meeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burden of proof (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trump Tower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Enquirer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Enquirer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence_Based_Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence Based Medicine", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://matzav.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/trump-3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The defense called just two. Trump decided not to testify on his own behalf.\n\nThe trial now shifts to closing arguments, scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nAfter that, it will be up to 12 jurors to decide whether prosecutors have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified his company\u00b4s business records as part of a broader effort to keep stories about marital infidelity from becoming public during his 2016 presidential campaign. He has pleaded not guilty and denies any wrongdoing.\n\nA conviction could come down to how the jurors interpret the testimony and which witnesses they find credible. The jury must be unanimous. The records involved include 11 checks sent to Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, as well as invoices and company ledger entries related to those payments.\n\nHere\u00b4s a look at key trial witnesses and what they had to say:\n\nThis combination photo shows, top row from left, Michael Cohen on May 14, 2024, in New York, Stormy Daniels on May 23, 2018, in West Hollywood, Calif., Hope Hick on Feb. 27, 2018, in Washington, and bottom row from left, Jeffrey McConney on Nov. 15, 2022, in New York, David Pecker on Jan. 31, 2014, in New York and Madeleine Westerhout on April 2, 2018, in Washington. After 22 witnesses, testimony is over at former President Donald Trump's criminal trial in New York. Prosecutors and Trump's lawyers are scheduled to make their closing arguments Tuesday, May 28, 2024. (AP Photo)\n\nAs Trump sat feet away, the porn actor, writer and director, gave a detailed and at times graphic account of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump in Nevada in 2006. After they met at a celebrity golf tournament, she said, Trump invited her to dinner but then engaged her in conversation in his hotel room and startled her by stripping to his underwear while she was in the bathroom.\n\n\"I felt the room spin in slow motion. I felt the blood basically leave my hands and my feet,\" Daniels testified. \"I just thought, 'Oh, my God, what did I misread to get here?\u00b4 Because the intention was pretty clear, somebody stripped down in their underwear and posing on the bed, like waiting for you.\"\n\nDaniels said Trump did not physically threaten her, but \"my own insecurities in that moment kept me from saying no.\" Daniels said she kept in touch with Trump for about a year in hopes of appearing on his TV show \"The Apprentice,\" but it never happened.\n\nDaniels spoke about accepting $15,000 for a magazine interview in 2011. The story was not printed at the time but ended up on a gossip website without her consent. Her lawyer, in consultation with Cohen, complained and had the story taken down.\n\nIn 2016, Daniels authorized her manager to shop her story again but found little interest until the release of the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" recording of Trump boasting about grabbing women's genitals without their permission.\n\nDaniels told the jury she accepted $130,000 from Cohen in the final weeks of the election in exchange for a legal agreement to keep the claim to herself.\n\nTrump\u00b4s lawyers grilled Daniels about her motivation, eliciting testimony that she hates the former Republican president. She pushed back on the defense\u00b4s suggestion that her story was fabricated, saying if it was fiction, \"I would have written it to be a lot better.\"\n\nDaniels\u00b4 testimony was among the most awaited in the trial. She had shared her story before, but this was the first time she testified about it in front of Trump. Trump\u00b4s lawyers objected to much of Daniels\u00b4 testimony and twice sought a mistrial, arguing that her feelings of a power imbalance with Trump and her blunt answers about the alleged sexual encounter should not have been put before the jury.\n\nA longtime Trump friend, Pecker was the publisher of the National Enquirer and chief executive of its parent company, American Media Inc., during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nPecker told the jury he agreed to be the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump\u00b4s campaign, looking out for damaging stories so they could be suppressed. He said he agreed to the role - and to a plan to publish positive stories about Trump and negative stories about his opponents - at an August 2015 meeting with Trump and Cohen.\n\n\"If there were any rumors in the marketplace about Mr. Trump or his family or any negative stories that were coming out or anything that I heard overall,\" Pecker said, \"I would call Michael Cohen directly.\"\n\nHe said he told the National Enquirer's editor at the time, Dylan Howard, \"that we are going to try to help the campaign, and to do that, I want to keep this as quiet as possible.\"\n\nPecker testified that the company squashed one potential story by paying $30,000 to a Trump Tower doorman. It paid $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal, to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump.\n\nBut when Daniels came forward, Pecker said, he told Howard: \"I am not a bank, and we are not paying out any further disbursements or monies.\"\n\nInstead, he alerted Cohen that Daniels was shopping a story about Trump, and let the lawyer handle it. Trump denies having sex with either McDougal or Daniels.\n\nWhen The Wall Street Journal reported, just days before Election Day, that the Enquirer had paid McDougal, Pecker said Trump was upset, saying, \"How could this happen? I thought you had this under control?\"\n\n\"Our call ended very abruptly,\" Pecker said. \"He didn\u00b4t say goodbye, which was very unusual.\"\n\nA lawyer known for representing people trying to sell celebrity sex tapes or other embarrassing information, Davidson negotiated the hush money deals for McDougal and Daniels. He gave jurors an inside look at the negotiations and helped corroborate Pecker\u00b4s testimony.\n\nAt first, Davidson said, the National Enquirer was not interested in acquiring McDougal\u00b4s story, saying she \"lacked documentary evidence.\" But the tabloid eventually bought it at Pecker\u00b4s behest. Davidson said he understood it would never be published because of \"an unspoken understanding that there was an affiliation\" between Pecker and Trump and that the National Enquirer would not run the story \"because it would hurt Donald Trump.\"\n\nDavidson said he dealt directly with Cohen, never with Trump. While Cohen may not have explicitly stated he was working on Trump\u00b4s behalf, Davidson said he felt the implication was clear.\n\nDavidson testified that about a month after Trump won the election, Cohen complained in a phone conversation that the president-elect hadn\u00b4t yet paid him back for the $130,000 payment to Daniels.\n\nCohen, a flawed but vital prosecution witness, testified about working with the National Enquirer to suppress negative stories about Trump. Cohen insisted he was working at Trump's direction when the lawyer helped orchestrate the payments to McDougal and Daniels.\n\nCohen testified that he kept the detail-oriented Trump updated on the payoffs.\n\nRegarding the decision to pay Daniels, Cohen said Trump felt it was best to buy her silence.\n\n\"He stated to me that he had spoken to some friends, some individuals, very smart people, and that it\u00b4s $130,000. You\u00b4re like a billionaire. Just pay it. There is no reason to keep this thing out there. So do it,\" Cohen said.\n\n\"And he expressed to me: Just do it. Go meet up with Allen Weisselberg and figure this whole thing out,\" Cohen said, referring to the Trump Organization\u00b4s chief financial officer at the time.\n\nTestifying over the course of four days, Cohen told the jury he sought Trump\u00b4s approval for the Daniels payment because \"everything required Mr. Trump\u00b4s sign-off. On top of that, I wanted the money back.\"\n\nWhen it briefly looked like the deal with Daniels might fall apart, Cohen said Trump got \"really angry with me,\" saying, \"I thought you took care of this?\"\n\nCohen used money he borrowed money from a bank to make the $130,000 payment to Daniels. Trump later reimbursed him. How Trump\u00b4s company recorded those reimbursements - paid out of a Trump trust and personal accounts - is the core of the prosecution\u00b4s case. Cohen said he submitted monthly invoices for a year for legal work he never actually performed, pursuant to a purported retainer agreement that he said did not exist.\n\nCohen said he discussed the reimbursement plan with Trump at the White House in February 2017. He recalled that Trump asked him whether he needed money, then promised a check soon would cover the first two months of invoices, totaling $70,000.\n\nJurors also heard a secret recording Cohen made of a meeting he had with Trump in 2016 in which he briefed his boss about the plan to buy McDougal\u00b4s story.\n\nTrump\u00b4s lawyers have fought to discredit Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, past lies and his recollection of key details. On cross-examination, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump\u00b4s company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump. Cohen also insisted he did not actually commit some crimes to which he pleaded guilty in 2018, including bank fraud and tax evasion. In that case, Cohen also pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and to campaign finance violations.\n\nCohen is the linchpin of the prosecution case, the only witness to testify that Trump had direct involvement in arranging his repayment. The verdict could hinge on whether jurors believe him.\n\nTrump\u00b4s former campaign and White House communications director, Hicks testified about the frenetic days after the \"Access Hollywood\" leak as she and Trump\u00b4s political advisers tried to contain the fallout. Hicks said she was \"very concerned\" about the impact of the tape and she subsequently asked Cohen to chase down a rumor about another potentially damaging recording, which turned out not to exist.\n\nHicks said that after The Wall Street Journal published its article detailing McDougal\u00b4s hush money deal, Trump was concerned about how his wife, Melania, would take it.\n\n\"He wanted me to make sure the newspapers weren\u00b4t delivered to their residence that morning,\" Hicks said.\n\nWhen news of the Daniels payoff started to emerge in 2018, Cohen initially told reporters he made the payment with his own money and without Trump's knowledge. Hicks said Trump also told her \"that Michael had paid this woman to protect him from a false allegation, and that Michael felt like it was his job to protect him, and that\u00b4s what he was doing. And he did it out of the kindness of his own heart.\"\n\nShe said, however, that it was \"out of character\" for Cohen to take such an action on his own.\n\n\"I didn\u00b4t know Michael to be an especially charitable person or selfless person,\" Hicks said. \"He\u00b4s the kind of person who seeks credit.\"\n\nTrump\u00b4s lawyers called Costello, an attorney and ex-federal prosecutor, as their primary witness in a terse defense case aimed at undermining Cohen\u00b4s credibility.\n\nAfter the FBI raided Cohen's home and office in 2018, Costello offered to become his lawyer. He told the jury that during their first meeting, Cohen paced anxiously, saying his life, and his family's life, had been \"shattered.\"\n\n\"He said: 'I really want you to explain to me what my options are. What\u00b4s my escape route?\u00b4\" Costello said.\n\nCostello said Cohen also insisted that he had made the Daniels deal on his own, that Trump \"knew nothing\" about it, and that Cohen had no incriminating information about Trump he could offer to federal prosecutors.\n\n\"I swear to God, Bob. I don\u00b4t have anything on Donald Trump,\" Costello quoted Cohen as saying.\n\nProsecutors countered that Costello, who was close to Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, cozied up to Cohen to keep him loyal to Trump.\n\nIn one email, Costello told Cohen: \"Sleep well tonight. you have friends in high places,\" and relayed that there were \"some very positive comments about you from the White House.\"\n\nCohen ultimately chose other lawyers.\n\nJEFFREY McCONNEY: The Trump Organization\u00b4s former controller testified about working with Weisselberg to set up payments to Cohen, including reimbursement for the $130,000 payment to Daniels, a bonus and money for taxes.\n\nRHONA GRAFF: Trump\u00b4s former executive assistant testified about adding McDougal\u00b4s and Daniels\u00b4 contacts to Trump\u00b4s contact list in the company\u00b4s computer system, the latter listed simply as \"Stormy.\" Graff also said she had a \"vague recollection\" of seeing Daniels once at Trump Tower.\n\nDEBORAH TARASOFF: The Trump Organization\u00b4s accounts payable supervisor testified about processing the payments to Cohen, including receiving checks that Trump had signed at the White House. Under defense questioning, she acknowledged permission to cut Cohen\u00b4s checks came not from Trump himself, but from Weisselberg and McConney.\n\nMADELEINE WESTERHOUT: Trump\u00b4s White House secretary from 2017 to 2019 testified about Trump signing checks, saying he sometimes would sign without reviewing them.\n\nAssociated Press writers Eric Tucker, Alanna Durkin Richer and Colleen Long in Washington and Michelle L.

Closing arguments are coming", "body": "By MICHAEL R. SISAK, JENNIFER PELTZ and JAKE OFFENHARTZ - Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- After 22 witnesses, including a porn actor, tabloid publisher and White House insiders, testimony is over at Donald Trump's criminal trial in New York.\n\nProsecutors called 20 witnesses. The defense called just two. Trump decided not to testify on his own behalf.\n\nThe trial now shifts to closing arguments, scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nAfter that, it will be up to 12 jurors to decide whether prosecutors have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified his company's business records as part of a broader effort to keep stories about marital infidelity from becoming public during his 2016 presidential campaign. He has pleaded not guilty and denies any wrongdoing.\n\nA conviction could come down to how the jurors interpret the testimony and which witnesses they find credible. The jury must be unanimous. The records involved include 11 checks sent to Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, as well as invoices and company ledger entries related to those payments.\n\nHere's a look at key trial witnesses and what they had to say:\n\nSTORMY DANIELS\n\nAs Trump sat feet away, the porn actor, writer and director, gave a detailed and at times graphic account of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump in Nevada in 2006. After they met at a celebrity golf tournament, she said, Trump invited her to dinner but then engaged her in conversation in his hotel room and startled her by stripping to his underwear while she was in the bathroom.\n\n\"I felt the room spin in slow motion. I felt the blood basically leave my hands and my feet,\" Daniels testified. \"I just thought, 'Oh, my God, what did I misread to get here?' Because the intention was pretty clear, somebody stripped down in their underwear and posing on the bed, like waiting for you.\"\n\nDaniels said Trump did not physically threaten her, but \"my own insecurities in that moment kept me from saying no.\" Daniels said she kept in touch with Trump for about a year in hopes of appearing on his TV show \"The Apprentice,\" but it never happened.\n\nDaniels spoke about accepting $15,000 for a magazine interview in 2011. The story was not printed at the time but ended up on a gossip website without her consent. Her lawyer, in consultation with Cohen, complained and had the story taken down.\n\nIn 2016, Daniels authorized her manager to shop her story again but found little interest until the release of the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" recording of Trump boasting about grabbing women's genitals without their permission.\n\nDaniels told the jury she accepted $130,000 from Cohen in the final weeks of the election in exchange for a legal agreement to keep the claim to herself.\n\nTrump's lawyers grilled Daniels about her motivation, eliciting testimony that she hates the former Republican president. She pushed back on the defense's suggestion that her story was fabricated, saying if it was fiction, \"I would have written it to be a lot better.\"\n\nDaniels' testimony was among the most awaited in the trial. She had shared her story before, but this was the first time she testified about it in front of Trump. Trump's lawyers objected to much of Daniels' testimony and twice sought a mistrial, arguing that her feelings of a power imbalance with Trump and her blunt answers about the alleged sexual encounter should not have been put before the jury.\n\nDAVID PECKER\n\nA longtime Trump friend, Pecker was the publisher of the National Enquirer and chief executive of its parent company, American Media Inc., during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nPecker told the jury he agreed to be the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's campaign, looking out for damaging stories so they could be suppressed. He said he agreed to the role -- and to a plan to publish positive stories about Trump and negative stories about his opponents -- at an August 2015 meeting with Trump and Cohen.\n\n\"If there were any rumors in the marketplace about Mr. Trump or his family or any negative stories that were coming out or anything that I heard overall,\" Pecker said, \"I would call Michael Cohen directly.\"\n\nHe said he told the National Enquirer's editor at the time, Dylan Howard, \"that we are going to try to help the campaign, and to do that, I want to keep this as quiet as possible.\"\n\nPecker testified that the company squashed one potential story by paying $30,000 to a Trump Tower doorman. It paid $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal, to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump.\n\nBut when Daniels came forward, Pecker said, he told Howard: \"I am not a bank, and we are not paying out any further disbursements or monies.\"\n\nInstead, he alerted Cohen that Daniels was shopping a story about Trump, and let the lawyer handle it. Trump denies having sex with either McDougal or Daniels.\n\nWhen The Wall Street Journal reported, just days before Election Day, that the Enquirer had paid McDougal, Pecker said Trump was upset, saying, \"How could this happen? I thought you had this under control?\"\n\n\"Our call ended very abruptly,\" Pecker said. \"He didn't say goodbye, which was very unusual.\"\n\nKEITH DAVIDSON\n\nA lawyer known for representing people trying to sell celebrity sex tapes or other embarrassing information, Davidson negotiated the hush money deals for McDougal and Daniels. He gave jurors an inside look at the negotiations and helped corroborate Pecker's testimony.\n\nAt first, Davidson said, the National Enquirer was not interested in acquiring McDougal's story, saying she \"lacked documentary evidence.\" But the tabloid eventually bought it at Pecker's behest. Davidson said he understood it would never be published because of \"an unspoken understanding that there was an affiliation\" between Pecker and Trump and that the National Enquirer would not run the story \"because it would hurt Donald Trump.\"\n\nDavidson said he dealt directly with Cohen, never with Trump. While Cohen may not have explicitly stated he was working on Trump's behalf, Davidson said he felt the implication was clear.\n\nDavidson testified that about a month after Trump won the election, Cohen complained in a phone conversation that the president-elect hadn't yet paid him back for the $130,000 payment to Daniels.\n\nMICHAEL COHEN\n\nCohen, a flawed but vital prosecution witness, testified about working with the National Enquirer to suppress negative stories about Trump. Cohen insisted he was working at Trump's direction when the lawyer helped orchestrate the payments to McDougal and Daniels.\n\nCohen testified that he kept the detail-oriented Trump updated on the payoffs.\n\nRegarding the decision to pay Daniels, Cohen said Trump felt it was best to buy her silence.\n\n\"He stated to me that he had spoken to some friends, some individuals, very smart people, and that it's $130,000. You're like a billionaire. Just pay it. There is no reason to keep this thing out there. So do it,\" Cohen said.\n\n\"And he expressed to me: Just do it. Go meet up with Allen Weisselberg and figure this whole thing out,\" Cohen said, referring to the Trump Organization's chief financial officer at the time.\n\nTestifying over the course of four days, Cohen told the jury he sought Trump's approval for the Daniels payment because \"everything required Mr. Trump's sign-off. On top of that, I wanted the money back.\"\n\nWhen it briefly looked like the deal with Daniels might fall apart, Cohen said Trump got \"really angry with me,\" saying, \"I thought you took care of this?\"\n\nCohen used money he borrowed money from a bank to make the $130,000 payment to Daniels. Trump later reimbursed him. How Trump's company recorded those reimbursements -- paid out of a Trump trust and personal accounts -- is the core of the prosecution's case. Cohen said he submitted monthly invoices for a year for legal work he never actually performed, pursuant to a purported retainer agreement that he said did not exist.\n\nCohen said he discussed the reimbursement plan with Trump at the White House in February 2017. He recalled that Trump asked him whether he needed money, then promised a check soon would cover the first two months of invoices, totaling $70,000.\n\nJurors also heard a secret recording Cohen made of a meeting he had with Trump in 2016 in which he briefed his boss about the plan to buy McDougal's story.\n\nTrump's lawyers have fought to discredit Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, past lies and his recollection of key details. On cross-examination, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump. Cohen also insisted he did not actually commit some crimes to which he pleaded guilty in 2018, including bank fraud and tax evasion. In that case, Cohen also pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and to campaign finance violations.\n\nCohen is the linchpin of the prosecution case, the only witness to testify that Trump had direct involvement in arranging his repayment. The verdict could hinge on whether jurors believe him.\n\nHOPE HICKS\n\nTrump's former campaign and White House communications director, Hicks testified about the frenetic days after the \"Access Hollywood\" leak as she and Trump's political advisers tried to contain the fallout. Hicks said she was \"very concerned\" about the impact of the tape and she subsequently asked Cohen to chase down a rumor about another potentially damaging recording, which turned out not to exist.\n\nHicks said that after The Wall Street Journal published its article detailing McDougal's hush money deal, Trump was concerned about how his wife, Melania, would take it.\n\n\"He wanted me to make sure the newspapers weren't delivered to their residence that morning,\" Hicks said.\n\nWhen news of the Daniels payoff started to emerge in 2018, Cohen initially told reporters he made the payment with his own money and without Trump's knowledge. Hicks said Trump also told her \"that Michael had paid this woman to protect him from a false allegation, and that Michael felt like it was his job to protect him, and that's what he was doing. And he did it out of the kindness of his own heart.\"\n\nShe said, however, that it was \"out of character\" for Cohen to take such an action on his own.\n\n\"I didn't know Michael to be an especially charitable person or selfless person,\" Hicks said. \"He's the kind of person who seeks credit.\"\n\nROBERT COSTELLO\n\nTrump's lawyers called Costello, an attorney and ex-federal prosecutor, as their primary witness in a terse defense case aimed at undermining Cohen's credibility.\n\nAfter the FBI raided Cohen's home and office in 2018, Costello offered to become his lawyer. He told the jury that during their first meeting, Cohen paced anxiously, saying his life, and his family's life, had been \"shattered.\"\n\n\"He said: 'I really want you to explain to me what my options are. What's my escape route?'\" Costello said.\n\nCostello said Cohen also insisted that he had made the Daniels deal on his own, that Trump \"knew nothing\" about it, and that Cohen had no incriminating information about Trump he could offer to federal prosecutors.\n\n\"I swear to God, Bob. I don't have anything on Donald Trump,\" Costello quoted Cohen as saying.\n\nProsecutors countered that Costello, who was close to Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, cozied up to Cohen to keep him loyal to Trump.\n\nIn one email, Costello told Cohen: \"Sleep well tonight. you have friends in high places,\" and relayed that there were \"some very positive comments about you from the White House.\"\n\nCohen ultimately chose other lawyers.\n\nOTHER NOTABLE WITNESSES\n\nJEFFREY McCONNEY: The Trump Organization's former controller testified about working with Weisselberg to set up payments to Cohen, including reimbursement for the $130,000 payment to Daniels, a bonus and money for taxes.\n\nRHONA GRAFF: Trump's former executive assistant testified about adding McDougal's and Daniels' contacts to Trump's contact list in the company's computer system, the latter listed simply as \"Stormy.\" Graff also said she had a \"vague recollection\" of seeing Daniels once at Trump Tower.\n\nDEBORAH TARASOFF: The Trump Organization's accounts payable supervisor testified about processing the payments to Cohen, including receiving checks that Trump had signed at the White House. Under defense questioning, she acknowledged permission to cut Cohen's checks came not from Trump himself, but from Weisselberg and McConney.\n\nMADELEINE WESTERHOUT: Trump's White House secretary from 2017 to 2019 testified about Trump signing checks, saying he sometimes would sign without reviewing them.\n\nAssociated Press writers Eric Tucker, Alanna Durkin Richer and Colleen Long in Washington and Michelle L.

Major week looms in Trump hush money trial", "body": "By ERIC TUCKER - Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The testimony in Donald Trump's New York hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict.\n\nIt's impossible to say how long all of that will take, but in a landmark trial that's already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could easily be the most important.\n\nHere's what to expect in the days ahead:\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nStarting Tuesday morning, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments expected to last for much of the day, if not all of it.\n\nPeople are also reading... Lancaster officials want speedway to cut down on noise Bills observations: Keon Coleman shows his size on bigger Bills WR corps Cheektowaga Police identify man who died in industrial accident The story behind Josh Allen emulating lookalike Chris Pratt in Bills schedule video Buffalo State deficit plan to cut 37 underused programs, offer buyouts School elections results: West Seneca, Hamburg pass budgets; incumbents lose seats School board turnover rampant, district budgets pass in elections in Erie and Niagara counties Buffalo Bills players, coaches spend day visiting 12 schools around the area A 'warning sign': Census data shows Buffalo is again losing population Bills Mailbag: Predicting breakout players for 2024 New Bills WR Marquez Valdes-Scantling hitches his wagon to superstar QBs Professional shoplifters wreak havoc on Buffalo-area stores Wegmans sued over sunscreen Prosecutors oppose May 14 killer's request: 'He is not entitled to the government's litigation playbook' Which proven players should the Sabres add to bolster their bottom six?\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election to a porn star who alleged she had a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nLook for prosecutors to remind jurors that they can trust the financial paperwork they've seen and the witnesses they've heard from. That includes porn actor Stormy Daniels, whose account of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump is at the heart of the case, and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme and authorized payments.\n\nIt's worth remembering that the defense, which called only two witnesses but not Trump, doesn't have to prove anything or convince jurors of Trump's innocence.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nExpect the defense to try to poke holes in the government's case by disputing Daniels' testimony about her hotel suite encounter with Trump and by distancing Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements to Cohen, who was responsible for the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels.\n\nThe defense may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid.\n\nAnd it'll certainly attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand. How much of his testimony the jury believes will go a long way in determining the outcome of the case.\n\nSince the prosecution has the burden of proof, it will deliver its summation last -- the reverse order from opening statements, in which the prosecution went first.\n\nONE LAST THING BEFORE THE JURY DELIBERATES\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nA critical moment will take place, perhaps Wednesday morning, before the jury begins its deliberations.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nIn an indication of just how important those instructions are, prosecutors and defense lawyers had a spirited debate last week outside the jury's presence as they sought to persuade Merchan about the instructions he should give.\n\nThe Trump team, for instance, sought an instruction informing jurors that the types of hush money payments at issue in Trump's case are not inherently illegal, a request a prosecutor called \"totally inappropriate.\" Merchan said such an instruction would go too far and is unnecessary.\n\nTrump's team also asked Merchan to consider the \"extraordinarily important\" nature of the case when issuing his instructions and to urge jurors to reach \"very specific findings.\" Prosecutors objected to that as well, and Merchan agreed that it would be wrong to deviate from the standard instructions.\n\n\"When you say it's a very important case, you're asking me to change the law, and I'm not going to do that,\" Merchan said.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, requested an instruction that someone's status as a candidate doesn't need to be the sole motivation for making a payment that benefits the campaign. Defense lawyers asked for jurors to be told that if a payment would have been made even if the person wasn't running, it shouldn't be treated as a campaign contribution.\n\nONCE THE JURY GETS THE CASE\n\nThe deliberations will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that's intentionally opaque.\n\nJurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it's hard to read too much into the meaning of any note.\n\nIt's anyone's guess how long the jury will deliberate for and there's no time limit either. The jury must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records, so that could take some time, and a verdict might not come by the end of the week.\n\nTo reach a verdict, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it.\n\nThings will get trickier if the jury can't reach a consensus after several days of deliberations. Though defense lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial, Merchan is likely to call the jurors in and instruct them to keep trying for a verdict and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others.\n\nIf, after that instruction, the jury still can't reach a verdict, the judge would have the option to deem the panel hopelessly deadlocked and declare a mistrial.\n\nAssociated Press writers Jennifer Peltz, Michael R.

After more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments Tuesday.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they won't be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence -- and there were many. Judge Juan M. Merchan, for instance, fined Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases Trump is confronting as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nWhere each Trump case stands Classified documents case Election interference Hush-money scheme Georgia election indictment Arizona election indictment Civil cases\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

They included Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and \"fixer\" as the-star witness; Stormy Daniels, who allegedly had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006; and David Pecker, a former tabloid publisher who paid to \"catch and kill\" negative stories about Trump to prevent them from damaging his electoral prospects during the 2016 election.\n\nTrump did not testify at his trial, despite his earlier statements that he would. This was not surprising, as many knowledgeable individuals believed the former president's penchant for talking too much and too long would have aided the prosecution more than advancing his own defence.\n\nAfter the prosecution and defence have made their final arguments in the trial, it will be up to the 12 New Yorkers serving as jurors to either convict or acquit Trump. A third possibility of a hung jury is also very much on the table. Some legal analysts believe that a hung jury seems more likely, at this point than a conviction or an acquittal.\n\nFor a guilty verdict on the felony charges, all the jurors must be convinced \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" that Trump falsified records with the intent to conceal another crime. In this case, that crime is violating election laws. If even one juror concludes that the charges against the former president have not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the result will be a hung jury. Although this does not equate to an acquittal, Trump and the legion of his supporters would undoubtedly consider it a victory. And, it is unlikely that the prosecution would attempt to retry the case.\n\nIf Trump is convicted, it will be up to the presiding judge, Judge Juan Merchan, to determine his sentence. Sentencing is likely to occur one to two months after the verdict. That means, the timing of the sentence could coincide with the Republican National Convention scheduled for July 15 to 18 in Milwaukee/Wisconsin, where Trump is expected to be nominated as the party's candidate.\n\nIf convicted, Trump could be sentenced to jail. Some experts believe that even if Trump is convicted, he might not serve any jail time since he would be a first-time offender. Regardless of whether he is sentenced to jail or not, Trump can still run for president and serve as president if elected.\n\nThe consequences of this trial extend far beyond what happens to Donald J Trump. Its more consequential and enduring aspect will be its impact on American politics and the presidency. In fact, the trial may have already changed America, especially in terms of how prosecutors at the federal and state levels view future presidents.\n\nWith the Trump trial, the Rubicon of trying a president has been crossed. Now that the precedent of a president in a courtroom has been established, future prosecutors will probably be more willing to bring charges against a former president.\n\nThe Trump trial signals a new era where the legal accountability of presidents becomes an ongoing reality. This could reshape the expectations and behaviours of future presidents, knowing that their actions could lead to legal scrutiny and potential trials long after their term in office has ended.\n\nEven if Trump avoids conviction in New York, his legal troubles will not be over. He currently faces charges in three other criminal cases with potential trials in each. That's the bad news for the former president.\n\nAt this time, however, it does not appear likely that any of these trials can be convened and concluded before the presidential election date of November 5. That is the good news for Trump.\n\nIf he is re-elected President on November 5, there is substantial conjecture among legal experts as to whether Trump could legally use the Office of President and the federal department of justice to evade the criminal charges against him. Trump has already claimed that there should be presidential immunity and the United States (US) Supreme Court held a hearing on that claim on April 25 and will hand down its decision on this before it adjourns in late June or early July.\n\nIn conclusion, according to the most recent political polls, Trump is running ahead of Biden and has a good chance of being re-elected president. Polls do not vote but people do. If the people decide that Trump should be the next president, it will not only be Trump who has been put on trial, it will be the country's political system and the US democracy.", "source": {"uri":

After that, the jury will begin to deliberate and then perhaps render a verdict.\n\nTuesday offers prosecutors and defence lawyers one last chance to address the jury. Judge Juan Merchan has said he expects the closing arguments to take up all day.\n\nInterestingly, arguments made by the lawyers are not evidence. Instead, the lawyers on either side will attempt to sum their cases for the jury.\n\nThe prosecution will stress on the paper trail and the witnesses' statements.\n\nDaniels, one might recall, offered graphic and memorable testimony about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nCohen, the ex-president's former fixer, testified that Trump was intimately involved with the entire scheme.\n\nRemember, it's not up to the defence to prove Trump's innocence.\n\nInstead, all the defence need is one juror to say that the prosecution hasn't proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nA single juror is all Trump's team needs to provoke a hung jury and a mistrial.\n\nA guilty or not guilty verdict requires all jurors to vote unanimously.\n\nThe defence is likely to assail Daniels' credibility when it comes to her alleged encounter with Trump.\n\nThe defence is also likely to point the finger at Cohen -- who made the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels.\n\nThe defence is also likely to argue that Trump was simply trying to protect his family and not win the election.\n\nHowever, it is the prosecution -- which opened the trial -- that will ultimately have the last word.\n\nJury instructions\n\nAll eyes will be on judge Merchan, who will deliver his instructions to the jury after arguments end.\n\nMerchan is likely to spend about an hour explaining to the jury the law governing the case.\n\nMerchan will also tell the jury what it can and cannot examine as it considers the former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nThe importance of the instructions can be gleamed from the fact that the prosecutors and defence lawyers had it out about the type of instructions Merchan ought to give.\n\nThe Trump team urged Merchan to tell the jury that the types of hush money payments made in this case are not 'inherently illegal.'\n\nThe prosecutor called this \"totally inappropriate\" and Merchan said it would go too far and is unnecessary.\n\nThe team also urged the judge to ponder the \"extraordinarily important\" nature of the case while issuing instructions.\n\nThey asked him to tell jurors to reach \"very specific findings.\"\n\nThis too drew the prosecutors' ire.\n\nMerchan again said it would not be appropriate to deviate from the standard instructions.\n\n\"When you say it's a very important case, you're asking me to change the law, and I'm not going to do that,\" Merchan said.\n\nProsecutors, on the other hand, asked Merchan to tell the jury someone's status as a candidate doesn't need to be the sole motivation for making a payment that benefits the campaign.\n\nDefence lawyers asked for jurors to be told that if a payment would have been made even if the person wasn't running, it shouldn't be treated as a campaign contribution.\n\nIn the jury's hands\n\nAs ever, the deliberations will be kept under wraps.\n\nThe jurors will adjourn to a room reserved for them and hash it out.\n\nHowever, they can reach out to the judge if they have any questions or to have parts of testimony read back to them.\n\nHow long will they take to decide? No one knows. It could be hours, days, weeks or even a month.\n\nThe jury has all the time in the world.\n\nRemember, they're examining 34 separate counts of falsifying business records.\n\nThat could take some time, so don't expect a verdict by the end of the week.\n\nWhat happens if they can't agree?\n\nThe defence will rejoice and seek an immediate mistrial.\n\nMerchan will likely summon the jurors and ask them to keep going.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_instructions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury instructions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Defense_Ministries", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Defense Ministries", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-9-2024-05-10337d13401f7a4a2c5690ed072604f2.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

But Trump's defense says too much depends on the testimony of Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, a convicted liar.\n\nThe defense comes first. When the trial testimony began five weeks ago, the defense highlighted how long ago this was: \"pre-COVID.\"\n\nThey said the sexual encounter with adult film actress Stormy Daniels never happened. They said that Trump himself never issued the false documents, he just signed nine of the 11 checks when they were presented to him. But most of all, they said Cohen is a liar, and there's no way to prove that Trump was fully cognizant of the crimes unless you accept Cohen's testimony about conversations with Trump.\n\nCohen was an unflappably calm witness. When he was asked: Did you commit crimes, did you lie to Congress, did you lie to banks, he said that he had. But for the most part, these were old lies. There was just one place where the defense may have raised a new inconsistency: when they pointed out that text messages suggest one of the key conversations with Trump may not have happened, because Cohen at that time was being harassed by a 14-year old prankster.\n\nBut, the prosecution may have cleaned that up when they pointed up something that the defense didn't deal with: There were many many conversations with Trump, including on the day the payments were wired to Daniels.\n\nCohen testified, and there was back up, that many of the lies, like the lie to Congress, were done to benefit Trump, in that case to hide dealings over a Trump Tower in Moscow. But mostly the prosecution worked hard to present all kinds of documentation they could use to back up Cohen' claims. For example, Trump's former comptroller described a meeting where he was told by Trump's former CFO Allen Weisselberg that Cohen would be reimbursed through payments described as \"a legal retainer.\"\n\nHope Hicks, Trump's former communications aide, testified that when Trump told her Cohen had made the payment out of the kindness of his heart, she didn't believe it, because Cohen is the kind of person who always wants credit.\n\nYears ago, Cohen testified to Congress that Trump told him in the Oval Office in 2017: \"Don't worry, Michael. Your January and February reimbursement checks are coming. They were FedEx'd from New York. And it takes a while for that to get through the White House system.\"\n\nAnd the DA presented evidence from four current and former Trump employees that showed that Cohen indeed met with Trump in the Oval Office, and that it did take a while to get through the system, and that the checks did soon arrive.

Cohen said he did this because Trump told him to \"handle it\" in order to prevent a negative story from coming out ahead of the election.\n\nBut Trump's defense attorneys maintained that the president never directed Cohen to make the payment.\n\nCohen testified that he was \"reimbursed $420,000\" for the $130,000 he paid to Daniels. Cohen said former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg suggested he \"gross up\" the payments and that Trump knew the details of the reimbursement.\n\nThe prosecution presented Cohen with 11 checks totaling $420,000. Cohen confirmed that they were all received and deposited. The checks had a description of a \"retainer,\" which Cohen said was false.\n\nBut Trump defense attorney Todd Blanche asked for an immediate order of dismissal, saying there is \"no evidence\" that the filings or business records at the center of the case were false, that there are \"absolutely no false business filings.\"\n\nBlanche said there is no dispute that Cohen acted as a personal attorney for Trump in 2017 and that there is no evidence or intent by Trump to mislead, hide or falsify business records.\n\nBlanche said there would be records of intent to defraud, if they existed, and that there were no other crimes being covered up. He said there was no evidence of anyone thinking of a campaign finance charge when the payment was made to Daniels or when Cohen and Weisselberg developed the repayment plan.\n\nBlanche said Trump paid Cohen a $35,000 \"monthly retainer,\" which is what the records state, and said there is no evidence from any witness to prove any criminal intent.\n\nReflecting on the prosecution's case, Blanche pointed to the alleged \"catch and kill\" strategy used to prevent a \"demonstrably false\" story a Trump Tower doorman had about Trump from being published.\n\nNY V.

The defence called just two. Trump decided not to testify on his own behalf.\n\nThe trial now shifts to closing arguments, scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nAfter that, it will be up to 12 jurors to decide whether prosecutors have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified his company's business records as part of a broader effort to keep stories about marital infidelity from becoming public during his 2016 presidential campaign.

The jury must be unanimous.\n\nThe records involved include 11 checks sent to Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, as well as invoices and company ledger entries related to those payments.\n\nHere's a look at key trial witnesses and what they had to say:\n\nStormy Daniels\n\nAs Trump sat feet away, the porn actor, writer and director, gave a detailed and at times graphic account of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump in Nevada in 2006.\n\nAfter they met at a celebrity golf tournament, she said, Trump invited her to dinner but then engaged her in conversation in his hotel room and startled her by stripping to his underwear while she was in the bathroom.\n\n\"I felt the room spin in slow motion. I felt the blood basically leave my hands and my feet,\" Daniels testified.\n\n\"I just thought, Oh, my God, what did I misread to get here?' Because the intention was pretty clear, somebody stripped down in their underwear and posing on the bed, like waiting for you.\"\n\nDaniels said Trump did not physically threaten her, but \"my own insecurities in that moment kept me from saying no\".\n\nDaniels said she kept in touch with Trump for about a year in hopes of appearing on his TV show \"The Apprentice\", but it never happened.\n\nDaniels spoke about accepting USD 15,000 for a magazine interview in 2011. The story was not printed at the time but ended up on a gossip website without her consent. Her lawyer, in consultation with Cohen, complained and had the story taken down.\n\nIn 2016, Daniels authorised her manager to shop her story again but found little interest until the release of the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" recording of Trump boasting about grabbing women's genitals without their permission.\n\nDaniels told the jury she accepted USD 130,000 from Cohen in the final weeks of the election in exchange for a legal agreement to keep the claim to herself.\n\nTrump's lawyers grilled Daniels about her motivation, eliciting testimony that she hates the former Republican president.\n\nShe pushed back on the defense's suggestion that her story was fabricated, saying if it was fiction, \"I would have written it to be a lot better.\" Daniels' testimony was among the most awaited in the trial.\n\nShe had shared her story before, but this was the first time she testified about it in front of Trump.\n\nTrump's lawyers objected to much of Daniels' testimony and twice sought a mistrial, arguing that her feelings of a power imbalance with Trump and her blunt answers about the alleged sexual encounter should not have been put before the jury.\n\nDavid Pecker\n\nA longtime Trump friend, Pecker was the publisher of the National Enquirer and chief executive of its parent company, American Media Inc, during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nPecker told the jury he agreed to be the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's campaign, looking out for damaging stories so they could be suppressed. He said he agreed to the role -- and to a plan to publish positive stories about Trump and negative stories about his opponents -- at an August 2015 meeting with Trump and Cohen.\n\n\"If there were any rumours in the marketplace about Mr Trump or his family or any negative stories that were coming out or anything that I heard overall,\" Pecker said, \"I would call Michael Cohen directly.\"\n\nHe said he told the National Enquirer's editor at the time, Dylan Howard, \"that we are going to try to help the campaign, and to do that, I want to keep this as quiet as possible\".\n\nPecker testified that the company squashed one potential story by paying USD 30,000 to a Trump Tower doorman. It paid USD 150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal, to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump.\n\nBut when Daniels came forward, Pecker said, he told Howard: \"I am not a bank, and we are not paying out any further disbursements or monies.\"\n\nInstead, he alerted Cohen that Daniels was shopping a story about Trump, and let the lawyer handle it. Trump denies having sex with either McDougal or Daniels.\n\nWhen The Wall Street Journal reported, just days before Election Day, that the Enquirer had paid McDougal, Pecker said Trump was upset, saying, \"How could this happen? I thought you had this under control?\" \"Our call ended very abruptly,\" Pecker said. \"He didn't say goodbye, which was very unusual.\"\n\nKeith Davidson\n\nA lawyer known for representing people trying to sell celebrity sex tapes or other embarrassing information, Davidson negotiated the hush money deals for McDougal and Daniels.\n\nHe gave jurors an inside look at the negotiations and helped corroborate Pecker's testimony.\n\nAt first, Davidson said, the National Enquirer was not interested in acquiring McDougal's story, saying she \"lacked documentary evidence\". But the tabloid eventually bought it at Pecker's behest.\n\nDavidson said he understood it would never be published because of \"an unspoken understanding that there was an affiliation\" between Pecker and Trump and that the National Enquirer would not run the story \"because it would hurt Donald Trump\".\n\nDavidson said he dealt directly with Cohen, never with Trump. While Cohen may not have explicitly stated he was working on Trump's behalf, Davidson said he felt the implication was clear.\n\nDavidson testified that about a month after Trump won the election, Cohen complained in a phone conversation that the president-elect hadn't yet paid him back for the USD 130,000 payment to Daniels.\n\nMichael Cohen\n\nCohen, a flawed but vital prosecution witness, testified about working with the National Enquirer to suppress negative stories about Trump. Cohen insisted he was working at Trump's direction when the lawyer helped orchestrate the payments to McDougal and Daniels.\n\nCohen testified that he kept the detail-oriented Trump updated on the payoffs. Regarding the decision to pay Daniels, Cohen said Trump felt it was best to buy her silence.\n\n\"He stated to me that he had spoken to some friends, some individuals, very smart people, and that it's $130,000. You're like a billionaire. Just pay it. There is no reason to keep this thing out there. So do it,\" Cohen said.\n\n\"And he expressed to me: Just do it. Go meet up with Allen Weisselberg and figure this whole thing out,\" Cohen said, referring to the Trump Organisation's chief financial officer at the time.\n\nTestifying over the course of four days, Cohen told the jury he sought Trump's approval for the Daniels payment because \"everything required Mr Trump's sign-off. On top of that, I wanted the money back\".\n\nWhen it briefly looked like the deal with Daniels might fall apart, Cohen said Trump got \"really angry with me,\" saying, \"I thought you took care of this?\" Cohen used money he borrowed money from a bank to make the $130,000 payment to Daniels. Trump later reimbursed him.\n\nHow Trump's company recorded those reimbursements -- paid out of a Trump trust and personal accounts -- is the core of the prosecution's case. Cohen said he submitted monthly invoices for a year for legal work he never actually performed, pursuant to a purported retainer agreement that he said did not exist.\n\nCohen said he discussed the reimbursement plan with Trump at the White House in February 2017.\n\nHe recalled that Trump asked him whether he needed money, then promised a check soon would cover the first two months of invoices, totalling USD 70,000.\n\nJurors also heard a secret recording Cohen made of a meeting he had with Trump in 2016 in which he briefed his boss about the plan to buy McDougal's story.\n\nTrump's lawyers have fought to discredit Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, past lies and his recollection of key details. On cross-examination, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent.\n\nCohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump. Cohen also insisted he did not actually commit some crimes to which he pleaded guilty in 2018, including bank fraud and tax evasion.\n\nIn that case, Cohen also pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and to campaign finance violations.\n\nCohen is the linchpin of the prosecution case, the only witness to testify that Trump had direct involvement in arranging his repayment. The verdict could hinge on whether jurors believe him.\n\nHope Hicks\n\nTrump's former campaign and White House communications director, Hicks testified about the frenetic days after the \"Access Hollywood\" leak as she and Trump's political advisers tried to contain the fallout.\n\nHicks said she was \"very concerned\" about the impact of the tape and she subsequently asked Cohen to chase down a rumour about another potentially damaging recording, which turned out not to exist.\n\nHicks said after The Wall Street Journal published its article detailing McDougal's hush money deal, Trump was concerned about how his wife, Melania, would take it.\n\n\"He wanted me to make sure the newspapers weren't delivered to their residence that morning,\" Hicks said.\n\nWhen news of the Daniels payoff started to emerge in 2018, Cohen initially told reporters he made the payment with his own money and without Trump's knowledge.\n\nHicks said Trump also told her \"that Michael had paid this woman to protect him from a false allegation, and that Michael felt like it was his job to protect him, and that's what he was doing. And he did it out of the kindness of his own heart\".\n\nShe said, however, that it was \"out of character\" for Cohen to take such an action on his own.\n\n\"I didn't know Michael to be an especially charitable person or selfless person,\" Hicks said. \"He's the kind of person who seeks credit.\"\n\nRobert Costello\n\nTrump's lawyers called Costello, an attorney and ex-federal prosecutor, as their primary witness in a terse defense case aimed at undermining Cohen's credibility.\n\nAfter the FBI raided Cohen's home and office in 2018, Costello offered to become his lawyer. He told the jury that during their first meeting, Cohen paced anxiously, saying his life, and his family's life, had been \"shattered\".\n\n\"He said: I really want you to explain to me what my options are. What's my escape route?'\" Costello said.\n\nCostello said Cohen also insisted that he had made the Daniels deal on his own, that Trump \"knew nothing\" about it, and that Cohen had no incriminating information about Trump he could offer to federal prosecutors.\n\n\"I swear to God, Bob. I don't have anything on Donald Trump,\" Costello quoted Cohen as saying.\n\nProsecutors countered that Costello, who was close to Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, cozied up to Cohen to keep him loyal to Trump.\n\nIn one email, Costello told Cohen: \"Sleep well tonight. you have friends in high places,\" and relayed that there were \"some very positive comments about you from the White House\". Cohen ultimately chose other lawyers.\n\nOther Notable Witnesses\n\nJeffrey Mcconney: The Trump Organisation's former controller testified about working with Weisselberg to set up payments to Cohen, including reimbursement for the USD 130,000 payment to Daniels, a bonus and money for taxes.\n\nRhona Graff: Trump's former executive assistant testified about adding McDougal's and Daniels' contacts to Trump's contact list in the company's computer system, the latter listed simply as \"Stormy\". Graff also said she had a \"vague recollection\" of seeing Daniels once at Trump Tower.\n\nDeborah Tarasoff: The Trump Organisation's accounts payable supervisor testified about processing the payments to Cohen, including receiving checks that Trump had signed at the White House.\n\nUnder defense questioning, she acknowledged permission to cut Cohen's checks came not from Trump himself, but from Weisselberg and McConney.\n\nMadeleine Westerhout: Trump's White House secretary from 2017 to 2019 testified about Trump signing checks, saying he sometimes would sign without reviewing them.",

Prosecutors and Trump's lawyers are scheduled to make their closing arguments Tuesday, May 28, 2024. (AP Photo)\n\nDAVID PECKER\n\nA longtime Trump friend, Pecker was the publisher of the National Enquirer and chief executive of its parent company, American Media Inc., during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nPecker told the jury he agreed to be the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's campaign, looking out for damaging stories so they could be suppressed. He said he agreed to the role -- and to a plan to publish positive stories about Trump and negative stories about his opponents -- at an August 2015 meeting with Trump and Cohen.\n\n\"If there were any rumors in the marketplace about Mr. Trump or his family or any negative stories that were coming out or anything that I heard overall,\" Pecker said, \"I would call Michael Cohen directly.\"\n\nHe said he told the National Enquirer's editor at the time, Dylan Howard, \"that we are going to try to help the campaign, and to do that, I want to keep this as quiet as possible.\"\n\nPecker testified that the company squashed one potential story by paying $30,000 to a Trump Tower doorman. It paid $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal, to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump.\n\nBut when Daniels came forward, Pecker said, he told Howard: \"I am not a bank, and we are not paying out any further disbursements or monies.\"\n\nInstead, he alerted Cohen that Daniels was shopping a story about Trump, and let the lawyer handle it. Trump denies having sex with either McDougal or Daniels.\n\nWhen The Wall Street Journal reported, just days before Election Day, that the Enquirer had paid McDougal, Pecker said Trump was upset, saying, \"How could this happen? I thought you had this under control?\"\n\n\"Our call ended very abruptly,\" Pecker said. \"He didn't say goodbye, which was very unusual.\"\n\nKEITH DAVIDSON\n\nA lawyer known for representing people trying to sell celebrity sex tapes or other embarrassing information, Davidson negotiated the hush money deals for McDougal and Daniels. He gave jurors an inside look at the negotiations and helped corroborate Pecker's testimony.\n\nAt first, Davidson said, the National Enquirer was not interested in acquiring McDougal's story, saying she \"lacked documentary evidence.\" But the tabloid eventually bought it at Pecker's behest. Davidson said he understood it would never be published because of \"an unspoken understanding that there was an affiliation\" between Pecker and Trump and that the National Enquirer would not run the story \"because it would hurt Donald Trump.\"\n\nDavidson said he dealt directly with Cohen, never with Trump. While Cohen may not have explicitly stated he was working on Trump's behalf, Davidson said he felt the implication was clear.\n\nDavidson testified that about a month after Trump won the election, Cohen complained in a phone conversation that the president-elect hadn't yet paid him back for the $130,000 payment to Daniels.\n\nMICHAEL COHEN\n\nCohen, a flawed but vital prosecution witness, testified about working with the National Enquirer to suppress negative stories about Trump. Cohen insisted he was working at Trump's direction when the lawyer helped orchestrate the payments to McDougal and Daniels.\n\nCohen testified that he kept the detail-oriented Trump updated on the payoffs.\n\nRegarding the decision to pay Daniels, Cohen said Trump felt it was best to buy her silence.\n\n\"He stated to me that he had spoken to some friends, some individuals, very smart people, and that it's $130,000. You're like a billionaire. Just pay it. There is no reason to keep this thing out there. So do it,\" Cohen said.\n\n\"And he expressed to me: Just do it. Go meet up with Allen Weisselberg and figure this whole thing out,\" Cohen said, referring to the Trump Organization's chief financial officer at the time.\n\nTestifying over the course of four days, Cohen told the jury he sought Trump's approval for the Daniels payment because \"everything required Mr. Trump's sign-off. On top of that, I wanted the money back.\"\n\nWhen it briefly looked like the deal with Daniels might fall apart, Cohen said Trump got \"really angry with me,\" saying, \"I thought you took care of this?\"\n\nCohen used money he borrowed money from a bank to make the $130,000 payment to Daniels. Trump later reimbursed him. How Trump's company recorded those reimbursements -- paid out of a Trump trust and personal accounts -- is the core of the prosecution's case. Cohen said he submitted monthly invoices for a year for legal work he never actually performed, pursuant to a purported retainer agreement that he said did not exist.\n\nCohen said he discussed the reimbursement plan with Trump at the White House in February 2017. He recalled that Trump asked him whether he needed money, then promised a check soon would cover the first two months of invoices, totaling $70,000.\n\nJurors also heard a secret recording Cohen made of a meeting he had with Trump in 2016 in which he briefed his boss about the plan to buy McDougal's story.\n\nTrump's lawyers have fought to discredit Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, past lies and his recollection of key details. On cross-examination, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump. Cohen also insisted he did not actually commit some crimes to which he pleaded guilty in 2018, including bank fraud and tax evasion. In that case, Cohen also pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and to campaign finance violations.\n\nCohen is the linchpin of the prosecution case, the only witness to testify that Trump had direct involvement in arranging his repayment. The verdict could hinge on whether jurors believe him.\n\nHOPE HICKS\n\nTrump's former campaign and White House communications director, Hicks testified about the frenetic days after the \"Access Hollywood\" leak as she and Trump's political advisers tried to contain the fallout. Hicks said she was \"very concerned\" about the impact of the tape and she subsequently asked Cohen to chase down a rumor about another potentially damaging recording, which turned out not to exist.\n\nHicks said that after The Wall Street Journal published its article detailing McDougal's hush money deal, Trump was concerned about how his wife, Melania, would take it.\n\n\"He wanted me to make sure the newspapers weren't delivered to their residence that morning,\" Hicks said.\n\nWhen news of the Daniels payoff started to emerge in 2018, Cohen initially told reporters he made the payment with his own money and without Trump's knowledge. Hicks said Trump also told her \"that Michael had paid this woman to protect him from a false allegation, and that Michael felt like it was his job to protect him, and that's what he was doing. And he did it out of the kindness of his own heart.\"\n\nShe said, however, that it was \"out of character\" for Cohen to take such an action on his own.\n\n\"I didn't know Michael to be an especially charitable person or selfless person,\" Hicks said. \"He's the kind of person who seeks credit.\"\n\nROBERT COSTELLO\n\nTrump's lawyers called Costello, an attorney and ex-federal prosecutor, as their primary witness in a terse defense case aimed at undermining Cohen's credibility.\n\nAfter the FBI raided Cohen's home and office in 2018, Costello offered to become his lawyer. He told the jury that during their first meeting, Cohen paced anxiously, saying his life, and his family's life, had been \"shattered.\"\n\n\"He said: 'I really want you to explain to me what my options are. What's my escape route?'\" Costello said.\n\nCostello said Cohen also insisted that he had made the Daniels deal on his own, that Trump \"knew nothing\" about it, and that Cohen had no incriminating information about Trump he could offer to federal prosecutors.\n\n\"I swear to God, Bob. I don't have anything on Donald Trump,\" Costello quoted Cohen as saying.\n\nProsecutors countered that Costello, who was close to Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, cozied up to Cohen to keep him loyal to Trump.\n\nIn one email, Costello told Cohen: \"Sleep well tonight. you have friends in high places,\" and relayed that there were \"some very positive comments about you from the White House.\"\n\nCohen ultimately chose other lawyers.\n\nOTHER NOTABLE WITNESSES\n\nJEFFREY McCONNEY: The Trump Organization's former controller testified about working with Weisselberg to set up payments to Cohen, including reimbursement for the $130,000 payment to Daniels, a bonus and money for taxes.\n\nRHONA GRAFF: Trump's former executive assistant testified about adding McDougal's and Daniels' contacts to Trump's contact list in the company's computer system, the latter listed simply as \"Stormy.\" Graff also said she had a \"vague recollection\" of seeing Daniels once at Trump Tower.\n\nDEBORAH TARASOFF: The Trump Organization's accounts payable supervisor testified about processing the payments to Cohen, including receiving checks that Trump had signed at the White House. Under defense questioning, she acknowledged permission to cut Cohen's checks came not from Trump himself, but from Weisselberg and McConney.\n\nMADELEINE WESTERHOUT: Trump's White House secretary from

The defence called just two. Trump decided not to testify on his own behalf.\n\nThe trial now shifts to closing arguments, scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nAfter that, it will be up to 12 jurors to decide whether prosecutors have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified his company's business records as part of a broader effort to keep stories about marital infidelity from becoming public during his 2016 presidential campaign. He has pleaded not guilty and denies any wrongdoing.\n\nA conviction could come down to how the jurors interpret the testimony and which witnesses they find credible. The jury must be unanimous. The records involved include 11 checks sent to Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, as well as invoices and company ledger entries related to those payments.\n\nHere's a look at key trial witnesses and what they had to say: STORMY DANIELS As Trump sat feet away, the porn actor, writer and director, gave a detailed and at times graphic account of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump in Nevada in 2006. After they met at a celebrity golf tournament, she said, Trump invited her to dinner but then engaged her in conversation in his hotel room and startled her by stripping to his underwear while she was in the bathroom.\n\n\"I felt the room spin in slow motion. I felt the blood basically leave my hands and my feet,'' Daniels testified. ''I just thought, Oh, my God, what did I misread to get here?'

''He's the kind of person who seeks credit.\" ROBERT COSTELLO Trump's lawyers called Costello, an attorney and ex-federal prosecutor, as their primary witness in a terse defense case aimed at undermining Cohen's credibility.\n\nAfter the FBI raided Cohen's home and office in 2018, Costello offered to become his lawyer. He told the jury that during their first meeting, Cohen paced anxiously, saying his life, and his family's life, had been \"shattered\".\n\n\"He said: I really want you to explain to me what my options are. What's my escape route?'\" Costello said.\n\nCostello said Cohen also insisted that he had made the Daniels deal on his own, that Trump \"knew nothing\" about it, and that Cohen had no incriminating information about Trump he could offer to federal prosecutors.\n\n\"I swear to God, Bob. I don't have anything on Donald Trump,\" Costello quoted Cohen as saying.\n\nProsecutors countered that Costello, who was close to Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, cozied up to Cohen to keep him loyal to Trump.\n\nIn one email, Costello told Cohen: \"Sleep well tonight. you have friends in high places,\" and relayed that there were \"some very positive comments about you from the White House\".\n\nCohen ultimately chose other lawyers.\n\nOTHER NOTABLE WITNESSES JEFFREY McCONNEY: The Trump Organisation's former controller testified about working with Weisselberg to set up payments to Cohen, including reimbursement for the USD 130,000 payment to Daniels, a bonus and money for taxes.\n\nRHONA GRAFF: Trump's former executive assistant testified about adding McDougal's and Daniels' contacts to Trump's contact list in the company's computer system, the latter listed simply as \"Stormy\". Graff also said she had a \"vague recollection\" of seeing Daniels once at Trump Tower.\n\nDEBORAH TARASOFF: The Trump Organisation's accounts payable supervisor testified about processing the payments to Cohen, including receiving checks that Trump had signed at the White House. Under defense questioning, she acknowledged permission to cut Cohen's checks came not from Trump himself, but from Weisselberg and McConney.\n\nMADELEINE WESTERHOUT: Trump's White House secretary from 2017 to 2019 testified about Trump signing checks, saying he sometimes would sign without reviewing them.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a

While opening statements are restricted to evidence, the prosecution and the defense will use closing arguments to argue how and why the evidence, testimony and law support a specific verdict.\n\nClosing arguments are expected to last for most or all of Tuesday and perhaps beyond. After closing arguments, the judge, Juan M. Merchan, will provide instructions to the 12 members of the jury that are meant to guide their deliberations. Lawyers on both sides tried to shape and, in some cases, limit the instructions during a conference with Justice Merchan last week.\n\nFrom there, the case will be in the hands of the jurors, who will consider whether prosecutors proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Trump was guilty on all, some or none of the 34 felony counts with which he has been charged.\n\nThe charges stem from a $130,000 payment made by Mr. Trump's former fixer and personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, in the days before the 2016 election to silence Stormy Daniels, a porn star who said she had sex with Mr. Trump a decade earlier. Prosecutors say Mr. Trump sought to cover up the sex scandal because he believed it would derail his campaign.\n\nIn 2017, after Mr. Trump had been elected and was in the White House, Mr. Cohen was reimbursed, and prosecutors have argued that Mr. Trump falsified business records to try to conceal the hush-money deal and the repayment.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Opening statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Philosophy_of_Religion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Philosophy of Religion", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics_of_Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics of Sexuality", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/28/multimedia/28trump-trial-whats-next-01-hwft/28trump-trial-whats-next-01-hwft-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

The jurors, who are expected to get the case as soon as Wednesday, could reach a verdict in a matter of days.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 payment to an adult film star on the eve of the 2016 election to keep her quiet about an alleged affair. The case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg may hinge on whether jurors believe Trump had an intent to defraud as well as conceal other crimes, namely election law and tax violations.\n\nWhile the false-records charges are \"simple and easy to understand,\" turning those misdemeanors into felonies using New York election law along with other legal theories is more complicated, said Jennifer Rodgers, a former federal prosecutor.\n\nThe defense's closing argument will cast the issue as \"muddled, confusing, and full of reasonable doubt,\" Rodgers said, while prosecutors \"will want to cast their enhancement theory as easy to understand and well supported by overwhelming evidence.\"\n\n\"It will be a tale of two cases, for sure.\"\n\nThe case is one of four criminal prosecutions Trump is facing as he campaigns to return to the White House, including state and federal charges over his failed attempt to overturn the result of the 2020 election. The presumptive Republican nominee has denied wrongdoing in all the cases, claiming without evidence that they're part of a coordinated conspiracy against him by Democrats.\n\nThe defense and prosecution in the hush money trial rested their cases early last week, but Justice Juan Merchan delayed closing arguments so they would not be split from deliberations by the holiday weekend and previously scheduled days off.\n\nMerchan has said closing arguments are expected to last all day Tuesday and could bleed into Wednesday. The judge must also give jurors so-called charging instructions to explain the law and aid their deliberations. Merchan told jurors they'll start deliberating \"hopefully, at some point on Wednesday.\"\n\nClosing arguments are important for prosecutors because a small number of witnesses \"may have overshadowed the rest of the evidence,\" according to Rodgers. She said the government must \"re-acquaint jurors with all of the evidence in the case, not just the unforgettable moments.\"\n\nProsecutors, who have the burden of proof, will argue that their case was overwhelmingly supported by multiple witnesses along with a trove of emails, text messages, business records and other pieces of evidence.\n\nBragg's team relied heavily on its star witness, former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who made the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels -- the adult film actress -- and was allegedly reimbursed by Trump in monthly installments throughout 2017.\n\nCohen gave jurors a first-hand account of every stage of the alleged hush money scheme, from its inception at a 2015 Trump Tower meeting to efforts to deceive the press and federal election regulators when news of the scheme leaked out three years later.\n\nMuch of Cohen's testimony was backed by other witnesses or documents. Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified he met with Trump and Cohen at Trump Tower in 2015 to discuss how he could use his tabloid to help Trump win the White House.\n\nHope Hicks, Trump's former campaign press secretary, testified about how the Daniels story was seen as an existential threat to Trump's campaign on the eve of the election. She said Trump was less bothered when the story eventually came out in 2018 because he'd already won, bolstering Bragg's charge that the payouts were intended to help Trump win the election.\n\nOne person who didn't testify was Trump, but his team, led by Todd Blanche, will seek to sow doubt in the mind of at least one juror. His closing argument will likely focus heavily on Cohen's credibility, which Blanche damaged during a withering cross-examination.\n\nBlanche will remind jurors of Cohen's well-documented perjury as well as testimony at the trial that the defense says turned out to be false.\n\nBased on arguments last week, Blanche can also be expected to hammer home the notion that prosecutors failed to prove Trump had any intent to defraud and that there was no conspiracy to violate election laws.\n\nThis article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.\n\nMilestone Alert!

Trump, who is almost certain to secure the Republican presidential nomination, is charged with falsifying business records related to paying the adult film star Stormy Daniels $130,000 for her silence about an alleged sexual liaison.\n\nProsecutors argue that the payments amount to election interference as Trump was running in the 2016 race for the White House at the time and seeking to cover up a potentially damaging scandal.\n\nBut as details of the case and Trump's liaison with Daniels have been brought before a Manhattan jury, they have had seemingly little impact on the 2024 race - where Trump still often narrowly leads Joe Biden in head-to-head polls and is performing strongly in the swings states that are crucial to victory.\n\nTrump denies all the charges.\n\nThe trial has played out in remarkable scenes where Trump has been in court and largely kept off the campaign trial, except at weekends and some events in and around New York City. Despite admonishments from the court, he has continued to rail against his prosecutors, and Judge Juan Merchan, on social media, labelling the trial as a \"witch hunt\".\n\nCentral to the case is the testimony of Trump's former lawyer and once-feared fixer Michael Cohen. Cohen gave vital evidence for the role that Trump played in the alleged hush-money scheme, but was also brutally grilled by Trump's lawyers for his previous history of lying and his evident dislike of his former boss and desire to see him behind bars.\n\nWhat weight the jury places on the reliability of Cohen's testimony is likely to decide the case one way or the other. If found guilty, Trump could face the prospect of jail, though that is mostly seen as unlikely. Any guilty verdict would also almost certainly trigger a lengthy series of appeals.\n\nTrump also faces three other criminal trials: one for trying to sway the 2020 election in Georgia, another for his conduct around the January 6 attack on the Capitol and a third one related to his treatment of sensitive documents after he left the White House. However, all three have been seriously delayed and none are seen as likely to conclude - or even start - before November's presidential election.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "victoria_bekiempis@theguardian.com", "name": "Victoria Bekiempis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Witch-hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20ca3a87e2c2e1d5e1ec39def0925f717ec8623d/0_94_5819_3492/master/5819.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=7d8546209306a8cd1089da773560de56", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 2292, "textEnd": 2301}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The defence called just two. Trump decided not to testify on his own behalf.\n\nAlso Read | Talat Hussain Dies: Legendary Pakistani Actor Passes Away After Prolonged Illness.\n\nThe trial now shifts to closing arguments, scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nAfter that, it will be up to 12 jurors to decide whether prosecutors have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified his company's business records as part of a broader effort to keep stories about marital infidelity from becoming public during his 2016 presidential campaign. He has pleaded not guilty and denies any wrongdoing.\n\nAlso Read | Landslide in Papua New Guinea: Over 670 People Feared Dead in Enga Province Landslide, Reports UN Migration Agency.\n\nA conviction could come down to how the jurors interpret the testimony and which witnesses they find credible. The jury must be unanimous. The records involved include 11 checks sent to Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, as well as invoices and company ledger entries related to those payments.\n\nHere's a look at key trial witnesses and what they had to say:\n\nSTORMY DANIELS\n\nAs Trump sat feet away, the porn actor, writer and director, gave a detailed and at times graphic account of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump in Nevada in 2006. After they met at a celebrity golf tournament, she said, Trump invited her to dinner but then engaged her in conversation in his hotel room and startled her by stripping to his underwear while she was in the bathroom.\n\n\"I felt the room spin in slow motion. I felt the blood basically leave my hands and my feet,\" Daniels testified. \"I just thought, Oh, my God, what did I misread to get here?' Because the intention was pretty clear, somebody stripped down in their underwear and posing on the bed, like waiting for you.\"\n\nDaniels said Trump did not physically threaten her, but \"my own insecurities in that moment kept me from saying no\". Daniels said she kept in touch with Trump for about a year in hopes of appearing on his TV show \"The Apprentice\", but it never happened.\n\nDaniels spoke about accepting USD 15,000 for a magazine interview in 2011. The story was not printed at the time but ended up on a gossip website without her consent. Her lawyer, in consultation with Cohen, complained and had the story taken down.\n\nIn 2016, Daniels authorised her manager to shop her story again but found little interest until the release of the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" recording of Trump boasting about grabbing women's genitals without their permission.\n\nDaniels told the jury she accepted USD 130,000 from Cohen in the final weeks of the election in exchange for a legal agreement to keep the claim to herself.\n\nTrump's lawyers grilled Daniels about her motivation, eliciting testimony that she hates the former Republican president. She pushed back on the defense's suggestion that her story was fabricated, saying if it was fiction, \"I would have written it to be a lot better.\"\n\nDaniels' testimony was among the most awaited in the trial. She had shared her story before, but this was the first time she testified about it in front of Trump. Trump's lawyers objected to much of Daniels' testimony and twice sought a mistrial, arguing that her feelings of a power imbalance with Trump and her blunt answers about the alleged sexual encounter should not have been put before the jury.\n\nDAVID PECKER\n\nA longtime Trump friend, Pecker was the publisher of the National Enquirer and chief executive of its parent company, American Media Inc, during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nPecker told the jury he agreed to be the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's campaign, looking out for damaging stories so they could be suppressed. He said he agreed to the role -- and to a plan to publish positive stories about Trump and negative stories about his opponents -- at an August 2015 meeting with Trump and Cohen.\n\n\"If there were any rumours in the marketplace about Mr Trump or his family or any negative stories that were coming out or anything that I heard overall,\" Pecker said, \"I would call Michael Cohen directly.\"\n\nHe said he told the National Enquirer's editor at the time, Dylan Howard, \"that we are going to try to help the campaign, and to do that, I want to keep this as quiet as possible\".\n\nPecker testified that the company squashed one potential story by paying USD 30,000 to a Trump Tower doorman. It paid USD 150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal, to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump.\n\nBut when Daniels came forward, Pecker said, he told Howard: \"I am not a bank, and we are not paying out any further disbursements or monies.\"\n\nInstead, he alerted Cohen that Daniels was shopping a story about Trump, and let the lawyer handle it. Trump denies having sex with either McDougal or Daniels.\n\nWhen The Wall Street Journal reported, just days before Election Day, that the Enquirer had paid McDougal, Pecker said Trump was upset, saying, \"How could this happen? I thought you had this under control?\"\n\n\"Our call ended very abruptly,\" Pecker said. \"He didn't say goodbye, which was very unusual.\"\n\nKEITH DAVIDSON\n\nA lawyer known for representing people trying to sell celebrity sex tapes or other embarrassing information, Davidson negotiated the hush money deals for McDougal and Daniels. He gave jurors an inside look at the negotiations and helped corroborate Pecker's testimony.\n\nAt first, Davidson said, the National Enquirer was not interested in acquiring McDougal's story, saying she \"lacked documentary evidence\". But the tabloid eventually bought it at Pecker's behest. Davidson said he understood it would never be published because of \"an unspoken understanding that there was an affiliation\" between Pecker and Trump and that the National Enquirer would not run the story \"because it would hurt Donald Trump\".\n\nDavidson said he dealt directly with Cohen, never with Trump. While Cohen may not have explicitly stated he was working on Trump's behalf, Davidson said he felt the implication was clear.\n\nDavidson testified that about a month after Trump won the election, Cohen complained in a phone conversation that the president-elect hadn't yet paid him back for the USD 130,000 payment to Daniels.\n\nMICHAEL COHEN\n\nCohen, a flawed but vital prosecution witness, testified about working with the National Enquirer to suppress negative stories about Trump. Cohen insisted he was working at Trump's direction when the lawyer helped orchestrate the payments to McDougal and Daniels.\n\nCohen testified that he kept the detail-oriented Trump updated on the payoffs.\n\nRegarding the decision to pay Daniels, Cohen said Trump felt it was best to buy her silence.\n\n\"He stated to me that he had spoken to some friends, some individuals, very smart people, and that it's $130,000. You're like a billionaire. Just pay it. There is no reason to keep this thing out there. So do it,\" Cohen said.\n\n\"And he expressed to me: Just do it. Go meet up with Allen Weisselberg and figure this whole thing out,\" Cohen said, referring to the Trump Organisation's chief financial officer at the time.\n\nTestifying over the course of four days, Cohen told the jury he sought Trump's approval for the Daniels payment because \"everything required Mr Trump's sign-off. On top of that, I wanted the money back\".\n\nWhen it briefly looked like the deal with Daniels might fall apart, Cohen said Trump got \"really angry with me,\" saying, \"I thought you took care of this?\"\n\nCohen used money he borrowed money from a bank to make the $130,000 payment to Daniels. Trump later reimbursed him. How Trump's company recorded those reimbursements -- paid out of a Trump trust and personal accounts -- is the core of the prosecution's case. Cohen said he submitted monthly invoices for a year for legal work he never actually performed, pursuant to a purported retainer agreement that he said did not exist.\n\nCohen said he discussed the reimbursement plan with Trump at the White House in February 2017. He recalled that Trump asked him whether he needed money, then promised a check soon would cover the first two months of invoices, totalling USD 70,000.\n\nJurors also heard a secret recording Cohen made of a meeting he had with Trump in 2016 in which he briefed his boss about the plan to buy McDougal's story.\n\nTrump's lawyers have fought to discredit Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, past lies and his recollection of key details. On cross-examination, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent.\n\nCohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump. Cohen also insisted he did not actually commit some crimes to which he pleaded guilty in 2018, including bank fraud and tax evasion. In that case, Cohen also pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and to campaign finance violations.\n\nCohen is the linchpin of the prosecution case, the only witness to testify that Trump had direct involvement in arranging his repayment. The verdict could hinge on whether jurors believe him.\n\nHOPE HICKS\n\nTrump's former campaign and White House communications director, Hicks testified about the frenetic days after the \"Access Hollywood\" leak as she and Trump's political advisers tried to contain the fallout. Hicks said she was \"very concerned\" about the impact of the tape and she subsequently asked Cohen to chase down a rumour about another potentially damaging recording, which turned out not to exist.\n\nHicks said after The Wall Street Journal published its article detailing McDougal's hush money deal, Trump was concerned about how his wife, Melania, would take it.\n\n\"He wanted me to make sure the newspapers weren't delivered to their residence that morning,\" Hicks said.\n\nWhen news of the Daniels payoff started to emerge in 2018, Cohen initially told reporters he made the payment with his own money and without Trump's knowledge. Hicks said Trump also told her \"that Michael had paid this woman to protect him from a false allegation, and that Michael felt like it was his job to protect him, and that's what he was doing. And he did it out of the kindness of his own heart\".\n\nShe said, however, that it was \"out of character\" for Cohen to take such an action on his own.\n\n\"I didn't know Michael to be an especially charitable person or selfless person,\" Hicks said. \"He's the kind of person who seeks credit.\"\n\nROBERT COSTELLO\n\nTrump's lawyers called Costello, an attorney and ex-federal prosecutor, as their primary witness in a terse defense case aimed at undermining Cohen's credibility.\n\nAfter the FBI raided Cohen's home and office in 2018, Costello offered to become his lawyer. He told the jury that during their first meeting, Cohen paced anxiously, saying his life, and his family's life, had been \"shattered\".\n\n\"He said: I really want you to explain to me what my options are. What's my escape route?'\" Costello said.\n\nCostello said Cohen also insisted that he had made the Daniels deal on his own, that Trump \"knew nothing\" about it, and that Cohen had no incriminating information about Trump he could offer to federal prosecutors.\n\n\"I swear to God, Bob. I don't have anything on Donald Trump,\" Costello quoted Cohen as saying.\n\nProsecutors countered that Costello, who was close to Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, cozied up to Cohen to keep him loyal to Trump.\n\nIn one email, Costello told Cohen: \"Sleep well tonight. you have friends in high places,\" and relayed that there were \"some very positive comments about you from the White House\".\n\nJEFFREY McCONNEY: The Trump Organisation's former controller testified about working with Weisselberg to set up payments to Cohen, including reimbursement for the USD 130,000 payment to Daniels, a bonus and money for taxes.\n\nRHONA GRAFF: Trump's former executive assistant testified about adding McDougal's and Daniels' contacts to Trump's contact list in the company's computer system, the latter listed simply as \"Stormy\". Graff also said she had a \"vague recollection\" of seeing Daniels once at Trump Tower.\n\nDEBORAH TARASOFF: The Trump Organisation's accounts payable supervisor testified about processing the payments to Cohen, including receiving checks that Trump had signed at the White House. Under defense questioning, she acknowledged permission to cut Cohen's checks came not from Trump himself, but from Weisselberg and McConney.\n\nMADELEINE WESTERHOUT: Trump's White House secretary from 2017 to 2019 testified about Trump signing checks, saying he sometimes would sign without reviewing them.

There was the former porn star, the tabloid publisher, his disgraced former fixer, the former press aide who broke down in tears on the stand.\n\nThey all spent much of their testimony rehashing a story that's been public for years. Yet they also brought out new details of the alleged scheme by Trump to pay off Stormy Daniels to keep her from going public about their sexual encounter, a decision at the heart of the prosecution's case against Trump.\n\nTrump denies having an affair with Daniels and says he's been falsely accused of 34 counts of falsifying business records to obscure his payments to buy her silence in advance of the 2016 election.\n\nClosing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday and a jury could come back with a verdict as soon as this week.\n\nHere are five things we learned during the trial:\n\nTo make their case, prosecutors need to convince the jury that Trump's main concern was his campaign when he paid Stormy Daniels to stay silent and falsified business records to conceal the payments.\n\nTrump's long-time friend David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enqurier, may have bolstered that point when took the stand and described an August 2015 meeting in Trump Tower when he agreed to be Trump's \"eyes and ears\" to help bury damaging stories during his campaign.\n\nPecker, with his gray hair brushed back into a collar-length mullet, told the jury how Michael Cohen, Trump's lawyer at the time, had called him in August 2015 and said \"The Boss\" -- his nickname for Trump -- wanted him to come to Trump Tower. Pecker described talking with Trump and Cohen for 20 to 25 minutes -- and that former aide Hope Hicks came in and out of the room while they met. Trump wanted to know how the Enquirer could help Trump's campaign, Pecker said. Pecker described how he offered to run positive stories about Trump, negative stories about his opponents, and notify Trump when women were contacting reporters with stories about the real estate mogul.\n\n\"I said I would be your eyes and ears because I know that the Trump Organization had a very small staff,\" Pecker told the jury. \"And then I said that anything that I hear in the marketplace, if I hear anything negative about yourself or if I hear anything about women selling stories, I would notify Michael Cohen\" and he would have another magazine kill the story \"or somebody would have to purchase them.\"\n\nPecker described how he later bought a story about Trump from a Trump Tower doorman and another from a former Playboy model. But when it came to suppressing Daniels' story, Pecker said he didn't want the National Enquirer to be associated with a porn actress. Michael Cohen ended up paying Daniels directly, and said Trump agreed to pay him back.\n\n\"Pecker established that they intended to make these payoffs to benefit that campaign from the time of the Trump Tower meeting in August 2015,\" says Norm Eisen, a senior fellow in governance studies at The Brookings Institution and former counsel to the Democrat-led House Judiciary Committee during Trump's first impeachment.\n\nRead more: What Happens if Trump Is Convicted? Your Questions, Answered\n\nHicks, Trump's former communications director, broke down crying on the witness stand moments after describing why Trump was so motivated to keep certain stories out of public view before the election.\n\nThe prosecution asked Hicks about a conversation she had with Trump in February 2018, as news stories began to emerge that Stormy Daniels had been paid to stay silent about her 2006 sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nHicks was serving as Trump's White House communications director and sat at a desk just outside the Oval Office at the time. She described Trump asking her how the news stories about his liaison with Daniels were playing in the press. Trump seemed relieved that the story had not come out earlier, Hicks said.\n\n\"He wanted to know how it was playing, and just my thoughts and opinion about this story versus having the story -- a different kind of story before the campaign had Michael not made that payment,\" Hicks said. \"And I think Mr. Trump's opinion was it was better to be dealing with it now, and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election.\"\n\nAfter she said that, prosecutor Matthew Colangelo said, \"No further questions.\" She began to cry moments later.\n\nDaniels told the jury that she felt there was a power imbalance when Trump allegedly had sex with her in a Nevada hotel room in 2006. She described meeting Trump during a celebrity golf tournament on the shores of Lake Tahoe, the initial encounter that first set in motion the events of the case. She was 27-years-old at the time and attended the event to promote a porn studio. Trump invited her to his hotel room to discuss being on his reality TV show \"The Apprentice,\" she said.\n\nDaniels gave specific details from her time with Trump. She described Trump's bodyguard telling her which elevator to take to the penthouse, describing the double doors going into the room and the black and white tile floor. She recalled talking to him and then excusing herself to go to the bathroom where she peaked in his toiletry kit and saw Old Spice and Pert Plus and gold tweezers in a manicure set. When she came out of the bathroom, she saw that Trump was on the bed, between her and the exit, wearing his boxer shorts and a T-shirt.\n\nDaniels said she was startled and thought to herself, \"Oh, my God, what did I misread to get here.\" \"I thought to myself, great. I put myself in this bad situation.\"\n\nShe recalled Trump having the upper hand at the moment. \"I did note there was a bodyguard right outside the door. There was an imbalance of power for sure. He was bigger and blocking the way. But I mean I wasn't not threatened verbally or physically,\" she said. She said she blacked out and the next thing she remembers, she was on her back on the bed. Daniels told the jury the sexual intercourse was brief, and Trump did not wear a condom, and she said that concerned her. Trump denies having sex with Daniels.\n\nAs Daniels was leaving Trump's hotel room, Daniels recalled Trump told her, \"We should get together again. We were fantastic together. I want to get you on the show.\"\n\n\"I told very few people that we had sex because I felt ashamed that I didn't stop it, that I didn't say no,\" Daniels said.\n\nCentral to the case is whether Trump himself had paid for Daniels to remain silent and obscured that payment as legal fees to Cohen.\n\nOn May 6, prosecutors showed the jury a handwritten note written by Jeffrey McConney, a former Trump Organization executive, that they said described what Cohen was being paid for. The note describes a \"reimbursement to Cohen\" for a $130,000 wire transfer, the amount Cohen paid Daniels.\n\nProsecutors want the jury to see that note as a crucial part of a paper trail showing that Trump intended to pay Cohen back for the payoff to Daniels, explains Eisen. \"We learned there was a smoking gun document that we had not seen before,\" says Eisen.\n\nRead more: Trump and Hush-Money Trial's Central Witness Share a Tortured History\n\nThat handwritten document cuts both ways for the prosecution. While it helped buttress their case against Trump, it also undermined the credibility of their already flawed witness Michael Cohen, Trump's long-time fixer.\n\nMuch of the prosecution's case pivots off the word of Cohen, a convicted perjurer. In 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to multiple crimes involving the hush-money scheme including lying to Congress and federal investigators.\n\nAfter the prosecution highlighted the $130,000 payment on the note, Trump's lawyers asked Cohen to explain another part of that tally of reimbursements to Cohen, specifically a payment for the tech firm Red Finch to rig Trump's ratings in some polls. Cohen paid Red Finch $20,000 but charged the Trump Organization $50,000, pocketing the difference.\n\nTrump's defense counsel asked Cohen about that extra money he added when requesting a reimbursement from the Trump Organization.\n\n\"You stole from the Trump Organization, is that right?\" Trump's defense lawyer Todd Blanche asked Cohen on cross examination.", "source": {"uri":

But it offered a preview of how the Trump defense team may seek to parry five weeks of damaging testimony by poking holes in areas of the prosecution's case that it regards as particularly weak.\n\nOvershadowing all of this has been a line that Blanche used during opening statements -- that the charges themselves are flimsy not because of the evidence presented, but because of the exhaustion that all of Trump's scandals over the past several years -- from the hush money payments to the impeachments to January 6 -- have generated. It's a call to jurors to take a jaundiced view and accept that everyone relaying incriminating things about Trump is as self-interested as he presents himself to be, and cannot be trusted because they refuse to acknowledge it.\n\nLofty appeals to holding Trump accountable were something that, at this point, the wise could see through, Blanche suggested.\n\n\"And, listen, use your common sense,\" he said during opening statements. \"We're New Yorkers. That's why we're here.\"\n\nFor the defense, the fact of Michael Cohen is an argument by itself.\n\nCohen testified that he was a professional liar and bully for Trump until August 2018. Before then, he said that he would cross nearly any moral boundary to \"accomplish the task\" set by Trump; he portrayed himself as, after that date, committed to telling the truth.\n\nThe defense attacked him as self-interested with a financial stake in the case. But they only managed to deal one real blow when it came to Cohen's recollection of an event relevant to the charges. Cohen had testified that he spoke to Trump the day before he paid off Stormy Daniels; defense attorneys introduced evidence to suggest that the call was either entirely or, at least, partially about dealing with a 14-year-old that had been prank calling Cohen.\n\n\"He not only lied repeatedly in the past under oath, but he lied in this courtroom,\" Blanche told Judge Merchan, referencing that moment.\n\nCohen is important because he can, through his testimony, tie Trump more closely to the scheme than any other witness. He recalls phone calls in October 2016 in which Trump purportedly approved the payment to Daniels, more conversations after the election in which Trump agreed that Cohen should be reimbursed, and a meeting in January 2017 at which Trump purportedly approved how the reimbursements would work.\n\nApart from the prank caller-issue, Cohen brings a history of baggage that Blanche indicated he's ready to exploit: his admitted lies to Congress in 2017, his career as a liar for President Trump, his current bombastic media presence. It's all fodder for the defense to ask the jury to disregard what Cohen had to offer.\n\nTaking Cohen aside, the defense has posed the question: did the prosecution actually allege any crime?\n\nAs Blanche put it to Merchan, \"what the evidence shows is that they all got together in 2015 and agreed that they would talk about positive and negative stories, and that there would be positive stories pushed and negative stories pushed, and that Mr. Pecker would keep an eye out, keep an eye out for anything that he heard that was bad about President Trump.\"\n\nThat's not illegal, he said.\n\nIt was a point that Trump's defense made during cross-examination throughout the trial: there's nothing illegal about paying someone to sign a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nProsecutors need a broader campaign finance plot because the business records falsification is charged as a felony -- it was allegedly done with intent to enter into a campaign finance conspiracy, or with intent to commit either of two other crimes.\n\nInstead, Trump's attorneys argue that there could have been no criminal intent, because the aim was legitimate: to win the 2016 presidential election. Beyond that, they've argued, the timing is off: the reimbursement payments for Cohen's Stormy Daniels payment, $130,000 of which is treated as an in-kind contribution from Trump to himself with Cohen as a straw donor, took place after the election was won.\n\n\"Spoiler alert,\" Blanche said at opening arguments. \"There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It's called democracy.\"\n\nEven if there was no election conspiracy, that still leaves the matter of the allegedly phony entries themselves. In the Trump Organization's books, the twelve payments of $35,000 to Cohen were categorized as legal expenses, and not reimbursements. It's the basis of the business records falsification charge.\n\nTrump's attorneys want to have it both ways here: to make their case, they cite testimony from Michael Cohen (who they call an incorrigible liar) to the effect that he was working for Trump during the time of the payments as his personal attorney.\n\n\"Mr. Cohen testified that he was rendering services for President Trump during that time, as his Personal Attorney,\" Blanche told Judge Merchan last week.\n\nThe $420,000, then, was not a reimbursement for the Daniels payment with the tax hit included. Rather, it was payment for what Cohen was doing: providing legal services to Trump.\n\n\"When they were entered in the Trump system, they were entered as legal expenses for Retainer Agreement,\" Blanche said. \"There is no dispute that during 2017, that's exactly what Mr. Cohen was doing for President Trump.\"\n\nThere is, of course, a dispute here: Cohen has said that his title as \"personal attorney\" to Trump was less a substantive job description and more a lure to potential clients, to whom he could sell access to the White House.\n\nBut then, there's another argument: Trump himself had no intent to defraud because he did not order the records themselves to be falsified.\n\nIt's an attempt to deal with a stronger point in the evidence: the multiple checks signed by Trump going to Cohen that Trump Org officials later booked as legal expenses.\n\n\"Even if,\" Blanche said, \"there was evidence that the records themselves were false -- but they weren't\" -- then Trump created them honestly. The records, Blanche said, were \"generated in connection with Michael Cohen's personal relationship and Personal Attorney-client relationship with President Trump in 2017.\"\n\nWhat you have, then, are checks that Trump signed in order to pay Cohen his fee as his personal attorney. There was no intent to defraud there, no misleading or hiding the ball on what was actually a reimbursement.\n\nThough the arguments don't always fit together neatly, they, theoretically, don't need to: It's all to create as much doubt as possible in the minds of jurors. And that's standard criminal defense fare. It's like offering jurors a menu of different options from which to select, various paths they can take to find that key elements of the charges are doubtful enough to vote to acquit or to fail to reach a verdict.\n\nBut throughout is the same point I made above: The defense is animated by an appeal to the pernicious sense that this is what politics are about. That, as Blanche said, the case is merely about trying to \"influence an election,\" not a white collar crime in furtherance of concealing information.\n\nIn some ways, it replicates the fact pattern that gave rise to the hush money scheme. Trump did not live his life in a way that, before 2016, would have been seen as comporting with that of a presidential candidate. In order to win, prosecutors said, he believed that he would then have to buy the silence of various people -- mostly women -- who might be able to tell the truth about who he was.

One-fifty?\" Trump asks his attorney and \"fixer,\" Cohen, just two months before the 2016 election. \"Pay with cash,\" Trump then instructs.\n\nThis phone conversation, secretly recorded by Cohen, catches Trump calling the shots as the two men discuss financing for a $150,000 hush-money payment. The hush money was meant to keep voters in the dark about former Playboy model Karen McDougal's claim -- denied by Trump -- of a nearly yearlong affair with the then-Apprentice star in 2006.\n\nWhy is this taped Trump-Cohen phone call, labeled People's Exhibit 246, important? Because it makes it impossible for Trump to say he had no role in hush-money financing.\n\nProsecutors can be expected to argue that this recording directly connects Trump to an illegal campaign conspiracy.\n\nAs they alleged in opening statements, this conspiracy influenced the election by purchasing the silence of McDougal and -- for $130,000 more -- of porn star Daniels. Trump's indictment alleges he falsified 34 business records throughout 2017, his first year in office, to cover up Daniels' hush money.\n\nThe Trump-Cohen phone call shows Trump in the pilot's seat of the conspiracy, prosecutors will argue. Or, at the very least, he's in the cabin with Cohen. Also in the conspiracy cabin: Trump's then-CFO, Allen Weisselberg, and Pecker, the then-National Enquirer publisher, both of whom are name-dropped in the tape.\n\nNine times throughout his first year in office, Trump signed checks that are now key exhibits in the hush-money trial. Each was drawn on his personal bank account. Each paid Cohen $35,000 as a \"retainer.\"\n\nAnd each check, prosecutors say, is a felony-level falsified business record. These nine checks are our second smoking gun.\n\nAccording to his indictment, the checks reimbursed Cohen in monthly installments for the $130,000 wired to Daniels just 11 days before the 2016 election, along with some other money Cohen was due.\n\nWhy are these hand-signed checks so important?\n\nTrump can argue that he never saw or handled most of the 34 business records that prosecutors say he \"caused\" to be falsified to hide the Daniels hush money, records that include a year's worth of bogus Cohen \"retainer\" invoices and entries in the Trump Org business ledgers.\n\nBut Trump cannot claim he never saw or handled these nine checks.\n\nAnd that $35,000 amount on each check?\n\nThat amount matches exactly the $35,000 figure that Trump's then-chief financial officer, Weisselberg, landed on when calculating Cohen's monthly reimbursements -- as shown in People's Exhibit 35, described below.\n\n3. \"PAY ... ASAP ... OK\"\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche will likely argue on Tuesday that Trump was too busy running the country to have bothered with the nitty-gritty of falsifying documents. Trump was especially distracted -- even \"multi-tasking\" -- when he signed each of those nine checks, the defense has already suggested.\n\nBut People's 71 -- a January 2017 invoice from the Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, New York -- strongly suggests otherwise. See People's 71 in its entirety here.\n\nWhy is this evidence -- our third smoking gun -- so important?\n\nThe invoice shows Trump personally signing off on the golf club's $6,974.01 annual dues and \"food minimum.\"\n\nIt's proof that Trump continued to pay close attention to his personal spending in 2017.\n\nTrump's former White House executive assistant, Madeleine Westerhout, showed jurors this exhibit when she took the stand earlier this month, delivering a big blow to the \"multi-tasking\" defense.\n\nWesterhout also showed jurors emails revealing that, in June 2017, she got Trump's advance approval for the purchase, with his money, of a $650 Tiffany picture frame. Trump wanted to display a photo of his mother, Westerhout said, on the credenza behind his desk in the Oval Office.\n\nThe frame was 15% off, Trump was told before he approved its purchase.\n\nSo even in the White House, we have Trump signing off on golf fees and picture frames.\n\nThis proven micromanaging makes it easier for prosecutors to argue that Trump was paying attention when he signed $35,000 of his own cash over to Cohen -- who testified that his actual legal work as personal attorney to the president amounted to less than 20 hours in all of 2017.\n\n4. The single most important piece of evidence in the case\n\nWe now turn to the most important evidence in the case -- People's 35, our fourth smoking gun.\n\nThis is an October 2016 First Republic bank statement. Both Cohen and Weisselberg scribbled calculations on it.\n\nWhy is this bank statement important?\n\nBecause on just one page, it records Cohen wiring the $130,000 in hush money to Daniels' attorney just 11 days before the 2016 election.\n\nBut there's more: it also shows the Weisselbergian math behind Cohen's $35,000 hush-money reimbursement checks.\n\nAnd the two sets of handwriting -- Cohen's and Weisselberg's -- scrawled across the bottom show the alleged conspiring of Trump's closest lieutenants at the time: his fixer and his top numbers man.\n\nPeople's 35 does not have Trump's fingerprints on it. Jurors have only Cohen's word that Trump saw it. But prosecutors can argue Tuesday that it clinches the case for conspiracy and records-falsification -- subject to connection to Trump himself.\n\nIt will be up to jurors to decide if Trump would have blindly affixed his signature to nine $35,000 checks if he really believed they were \"retainers\" as labeled -- and if he really believed he was paying a lawyer who hardly worked for him anymore.\n\nIt will also be up to jurors to decide if Cohen and Weisselberg would have cooked Trump's books -- hiding the true nature of what Cohen was being paid for -- without the knowledge and approval of Trump, the micromanaging boss footing the bill.\n\nRead Business Insider's deep dive on People's 35 here.\n\n5. \"Sleep well tonight, you have friends in high places.\"\n\nFast forward to 2018. Trump has been in office for a year and, thanks to The Wall Street Journal, the world now knows about his porn-star hush-money scandal.\n\nIn early April, the FBI raided Cohen's office and apartment, seizing evidence it would later use to successfully prosecute him for his illegal $130,000 contribution to his boss's campaign.\n\nThroughout April, Trump worried Cohen would \"flip\" against him, prosecutors argue. So Trump, they say, authorized a communications back channel, whereby Cohen could talk to attorney Robert Costello, who could relay messages to his buddy Rudy Giuliani, then Trump's lawyer.\n\nThis alleged Trump-to-Giuliani-to-Costello-to-Cohen back channel is evident in this prosecution exhibit, People's 205. This is the infamous \"Friends in high places\" email that would be featured in the \"obstruction\" section of the Mueller Report.\n\nWhy is this April 21, 2018 email -- People's Exhibit 205 -- important?\n\nIt suggests the nearly invisible hand of Trump, covertly pulling strings to keep Cohen from cooperating with the justice department and spilling any election conspiracy beans.\n\n6. \"He will make sure to tell the President\"\n\nIn another email from that same day, People's Exhibit 204, Cohen is assured of Giuliani's gratitude for \"this back channel of communication\" to Trump.\n\nThis email, our gun number 6, again shows the covert, thrice-removed hand of Trump, pulling strings.\n\n\"I just spoke to Rudy Giuliani and told him I was on your team,\" Costello tells Cohen in the email.\n\n\"Rudy was thrilled and said this could not be a better situation for the President or you. He asked me if it was OK to call the President and (then-Trump lawyer) Jay Sekelow and I said fine,\" the email continues.\n\nGiuliani \"asked me to tell you that he knows how tough this is on your family and he will make sue [CQ] to tell the President,\" the email says.\n\n7. \"From which he entered into, through reimbursement...\"\n\nA week later, on May 3, 2018, the hush-money scandal was still in the news, and Trump posted what he may have believed would be a self-exonerating tweet.\n\nWhy is this panicked-sounding, somewhat garbled tweet important?\n\nIt's Trump acknowledging what prosecutors allege in those 34 felony falsification counts: That he knew Cohen's monthly retainer checks were not for legal fees at all.\n\nInstead, they were \"reimbursement\" (Trump's word) for \"a non-disclosure agreement\" (Trump's word again) -- also known as hush money.\n\nTrump tweets this admission just five months after signing his last $35,000 \"retainer\" check to Cohen.\n\n8. \"Mr. Trump fully reimbursed Mr. Cohen in 2017\"\n\nTwelve days later, on May 15, 2018, Trump affixed his black-Sharpie signature to a routine government disclosure form called an \"Executive Branch Personnel Public Financial Disclosure Report.\"\n\nProsecutors call this document People's Exhibit 81. It's the then-president's mandatory disclosure of his assets and liabilities.\n\nUnder \"Liablities\" -- which is the section where Trump must list the money he's borrowed -- Trump certifies that in 2017, he \"fully reimbursed\" Cohen an interest-free sum of between $100,000 and $250,000.\n\nWhy is this footnote on page 45 important? Prosecutors say it reflects Trump's admission that he repaid Cohen's $130,000 hush-money outlay.\n\nIn closing arguments Tuesday, prosecutors may well put People's 81 back on the courtroom display screens.\n\nThey'll scroll past Trump's signature to page 45 and say the footnote proves the then-president knew he was reimbursing Cohen for hush money throughout 2017 -- not paying legal fees as his falsified business records claimed.\n\n9. The AMI non-prosecution agreement\n\nOn September 21, 2018, lawyers for Pecker -- then the National Enquirer's publisher -- signed a non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors in Manhattan.\n\nThis is the Department of Justice agreeing not to prosecute the Enquirer's parent company, AMI, for illegal 2016 contributions \"to the campaign of a candidate for President of the United States.\"\n\nIn return, Pecker and AMI's other officers and employees agreed to cooperate in the feds' investigation.\n\nWhy is this non-prosecution agreement -- People's Exhibit 182 -- our ninth smoking gun?\n\nIt shows Pecker admitting to same kind of federal campaign-contribution offense -- in his case, for the $150,000 in hush money that silenced McDougal on Trump's behalf -- that's at the center of the falsification case.\n\nThe jury also knows that Cohen, too, pleaded guilty to this same offense: making an illegally high campaign contribution on Trump's behalf, in his case the $130,000 paid to Daniels.\n\nJurors will be instructed by the judge on Tuesday that they cannot view the AMI agreement and Cohen's guilty plea as proof that Trump, too, violated federal campaign finance law -- but these are tough bells to unring.\n\nRead Business Insider's deep-dive story on how the Federal Election Campaign Act is a central element of Trump's charges.\n\n10. Finally, a smoking micro-gun\n\nFinally, here's a smoking micro-gun with some assembly required.\n\nOnce assembled, it bolsters Cohen's testimony that shortly after 12 noon on October 26, 2017, Trump gave his final approval to the hush-money payment.\n\nPeople's 373 is a bank document showing that on that day, First Republic Bank employee Melissa Duran processed Cohen's request for a $131,000 advance on his home-equity loan.\n\nPeople's 374 is an email showing Duran passing this request to her loan servicing department at 12:22 p.m.\n\nPeople's 349 is a call log showing that on that day, Cohen called Trump at 12:26 p.m. and Trump called Cohen at 12:34 p.m. Their two phones were connected for a total of 4 minutes and 29 seconds.\n\nCohen testified that immediately after these calls with Trump, he took the elevator down from his Trump Organization offices at Trump Tower.\n\nThen, he told jurors, he walked across Fifth Avenue to his bank, to finalize the $131,000 transfer out of his home-equity loan, money he'd then wire to Daniels' lawyer the next day.\n\n\"Do you have any doubt in your mind that Mr. Trump gave you the final sign-off to go ahead and make the payment before you went to the bank to complete that?\" prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asked Cohen during redirect examination.\n\n\"No doubt,\" Cohen answered.\n\n\"Would you have paid Stormy Daniels the $130,000 had Mr. Trump not signed off?\"\n\n\"Because I wanted to ensure that I was going to get my funds back,\" Cohen answered.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors":

The defense called just two. Trump decided not to testify on his own behalf.\n\nThe trial now shifts to closing arguments, scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nREAD MORE: What to watch for in Trump trial's closing arguments, from a law school professor\n\nAfter that, it will be up to 12 jurors to decide whether prosecutors have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified his company's business records as part of a broader effort to keep stories about marital infidelity from becoming public during his 2016 presidential campaign. He has pleaded not guilty and denies any wrongdoing.\n\nA conviction could come down to how the jurors interpret the testimony and which witnesses they find credible. The jury must be unanimous. The records involved include 11 checks sent to Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, as well as invoices and company ledger entries related to those payments.\n\nHere's a look at key trial witnesses and what they had to say:\n\nStormy Daniels\n\nAs Trump sat feet away, the adult film actor, writer and director, gave a detailed and at times graphic account of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump in Nevada in 2006. After they met at a celebrity golf tournament, she said, Trump invited her to dinner but then engaged her in conversation in his hotel room and startled her by stripping to his underwear while she was in the bathroom.\n\n\"I felt the room spin in slow motion. I felt the blood basically leave my hands and my feet,\" Daniels testified. \"I just thought, 'Oh, my God, what did I misread to get here?' Because the intention was pretty clear, somebody stripped down in their underwear and posing on the bed, like waiting for you.\"\n\nDaniels said Trump did not physically threaten her, but \"my own insecurities in that moment kept me from saying no.\" Daniels said she kept in touch with Trump for about a year in hopes of appearing on his TV show \"The Apprentice,\" but it never happened.\n\nFormer Donald Trump watches as Stormy Daniels is questioned by defense attorney Susan Necheles on May 9, 2024. Courtroom sketch by Jane Rosenberg/Reuters\n\nDaniels spoke about accepting $15,000 for a magazine interview in 2011. The story was not printed at the time but ended up on a gossip website without her consent. Her lawyer, in consultation with Cohen, complained and had the story taken down.\n\nIn 2016, Daniels authorized her manager to shop her story again but found little interest until the release of the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" recording of Trump boasting about grabbing women's genitals without their permission.\n\nDaniels told the jury she accepted $130,000 from Cohen in the final weeks of the election in exchange for a legal agreement to keep the claim to herself.\n\nTrump's lawyers grilled Daniels about her motivation, eliciting testimony that she hates the former Republican president. She pushed back on the defense's suggestion that her story was fabricated, saying if it was fiction, \"I would have written it to be a lot better.\"\n\nWATCH: Stormy Daniels clashes with Trump attorneys during 2nd day of testimony\n\nDaniels' testimony was among the most awaited in the trial. She had shared her story before, but this was the first time she testified about it in front of Trump. Trump's lawyers objected to much of Daniels' testimony and twice sought a mistrial, arguing that her feelings of a power imbalance with Trump and her blunt answers about the alleged sexual encounter should not have been put before the jury.\n\nDavid Pecker\n\nA longtime Trump friend, Pecker was the publisher of the National Enquirer and chief executive of its parent company, American Media Inc., during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nPecker told the jury he agreed to be the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's campaign, looking out for damaging stories so they could be suppressed. He said he agreed to the role -- and to a plan to publish positive stories about Trump and negative stories about his opponents -- at an August 2015 meeting with Trump and Cohen.\n\n\"If there were any rumors in the marketplace about Mr. Trump or his family or any negative stories that were coming out or anything that I heard overall,\" Pecker said, \"I would call Michael Cohen directly.\"\n\nHe said he told the National Enquirer's editor at the time, Dylan Howard, \"that we are going to try to help the campaign, and to do that, I want to keep this as quiet as possible.\"\n\nFormer National Enquirer publisher David Pecker speaks from the witness stand during Donald Trump's criminal trial on charges that he falsified business records in 2016, in Manhattan state court on April 22, 2024. Courtroom sketch by Jane Rosenberg/Reuters\n\nPecker testified that the company squashed one potential story by paying $30,000 to a Trump Tower doorman. It paid $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal, to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump.\n\nREAD MORE: Ex-tabloid publisher testifies at hush money trial about scheme to shield Trump from damaging stories\n\nBut when Daniels came forward, Pecker said, he told Howard: \"I am not a bank, and we are not paying out any further disbursements or monies.\"\n\nInstead, he alerted Cohen that Daniels was shopping a story about Trump, and let the lawyer handle it. Trump denies having sex with either McDougal or Daniels.\n\nWhen The Wall Street Journal reported, just days before Election Day, that the Enquirer had paid McDougal, Pecker said Trump was upset, saying, \"How could this happen? I thought you had this under control?\"\n\n\"Our call ended very abruptly,\" Pecker said. \"He didn't say goodbye, which was very unusual.\"\n\nKeith Davidson\n\nA lawyer known for representing people trying to sell celebrity sex tapes or other embarrassing information, Davidson negotiated the hush money deals for McDougal and Daniels. He gave jurors an inside look at the negotiations and helped corroborate Pecker's testimony.\n\nAt first, Davidson said, the National Enquirer was not interested in acquiring McDougal's story, saying she \"lacked documentary evidence.\" But the tabloid eventually bought it at Pecker's behest. Davidson said he understood it would never be published because of \"an unspoken understanding that there was an affiliation\" between Pecker and Trump and that the National Enquirer would not run the story \"because it would hurt Donald Trump.\"\n\nLawyer Keith Davidson, who represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal, is questioned by prosecutor Joshua Steinglass during Donald Trump's criminal trial on April 30, 2024. Courtroom sketch by Jane Rosenberg/ Reuters\n\nDavidson said he dealt directly with Cohen, never with Trump. While Cohen may not have explicitly stated he was working on Trump's behalf, Davidson said he felt the implication was clear.\n\nDavidson testified that about a month after Trump won the election, Cohen complained in a phone conversation that the president-elect hadn't yet paid him back for the $130,000 payment to Daniels.\n\nMichael Cohen\n\nCohen, a flawed but vital prosecution witness, testified about working with the National Enquirer to suppress negative stories about Trump. Cohen insisted he was working at Trump's direction when the lawyer helped orchestrate the payments to McDougal and Daniels.\n\nCohen testified that he kept the detail-oriented Trump updated on the payoffs.\n\nRegarding the decision to pay Daniels, Cohen said Trump felt it was best to buy her silence.\n\n\"He stated to me that he had spoken to some friends, some individuals, very smart people, and that it's $130,000. You're like a billionaire. Just pay it. There is no reason to keep this thing out there. So do it,\" Cohen said.\n\n\"And he expressed to me: Just do it. Go meet up with Allen Weisselberg and figure this whole thing out,\" Cohen said, referring to the Trump Organization's chief financial officer at the time.\n\nTestifying over the course of four days, Cohen told the jury he sought Trump's approval for the Daniels payment because \"everything required Mr. Trump's sign-off. On top of that, I wanted the money back.\"\n\nWhen it briefly looked like the deal with Daniels might fall apart, Cohen said Trump got \"really angry with me,\" saying, \"I thought you took care of this?\"\n\nMichael Cohen is questioned by prosecutor Susan Hoffinger on re-direct before Justice Juan Merchan, as former President Donald Trump watches during Trump's criminal trial on charges that he falsified business records to conceal money paid to silence adult film actor Stormy Daniels in 2016, in Manhattan state court in New York City, May 20, 2024. Courtroom sketch by Jane Rosenberg/Reuters\n\nCohen used money he borrowed money from a bank to make the $130,000 payment to Daniels. Trump later reimbursed him. How Trump's company recorded those reimbursements -- paid out of a Trump trust and personal accounts -- is the core of the prosecution's case. Cohen said he submitted monthly invoices for a year for legal work he never actually performed, pursuant to a purported retainer agreement that he said did not exist.\n\nCohen said he discussed the reimbursement plan with Trump at the White House in February 2017. He recalled that Trump asked him whether he needed money, then promised a check soon would cover the first two months of invoices, totaling $70,000.\n\nJurors also heard a secret recording Cohen made of a meeting he had with Trump in 2016 in which he briefed his boss about the plan to buy McDougal's story.\n\nWATCH: How Trump's legal team is trying to ruin Michael Cohen's credibility in hush money trial\n\nTrump's lawyers have fought to discredit Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, past lies and his recollection of key details. On cross-examination, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump. Cohen also insisted he did not actually commit some crimes to which he pleaded guilty in 2018, including bank fraud and tax evasion. In that case, Cohen also pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and to campaign finance violations.\n\nCohen is the linchpin of the prosecution case, the only witness to testify that Trump had direct involvement in arranging his repayment. The verdict could hinge on whether jurors believe him.\n\nHope Hicks\n\nTrump's former campaign and White House communications director, Hicks testified about the frenetic days after the \"Access Hollywood\" leak as she and Trump's political advisers tried to contain the fallout. Hicks said she was \"very concerned\" about the impact of the tape and she subsequently asked Cohen to chase down a rumor about another potentially damaging recording, which turned out not to exist.\n\nWATCH: What Hope Hicks said on the stand in Trump's hush money trial\n\nHicks said that after The Wall Street Journal published its article detailing McDougal's hush money deal, Trump was concerned about how his wife, Melania, would take it.\n\n\"He wanted me to make sure the newspapers weren't delivered to their residence that morning,\" Hicks said.\n\nHope Hicks, a former top aide to former President Donald Trump, reacts while being cross examined by defense lawyer Emil Bove. Courtroom sketch by Jane Rosenberg/Reuters\n\nWhen news of the Daniels payoff started to emerge in 2018, Cohen initially told reporters he made the payment with his own money and without Trump's knowledge. Hicks said Trump also told her \"that Michael had paid this woman to protect him from a false allegation, and that Michael felt like it was his job to protect him, and that's what he was doing. And he did it out of the kindness of his own heart.\"\n\nShe said, however, that it was \"out of character\" for Cohen to take such an action on his own.\n\n\"I didn't know Michael to be an especially charitable person or selfless person,\" Hicks said. \"He's the kind of person who seeks credit.\"\n\nRobert Costello\n\nTrump's lawyers called Costello, an attorney and ex-federal prosecutor, as their primary witness in a terse defense case aimed at undermining Cohen's credibility.\n\nAfter the FBI raided Cohen's home and office in 2018, Costello offered to become his lawyer. He told the jury that during their first meeting, Cohen paced anxiously, saying his life, and his family's life, had been \"shattered.\"\n\n\"He said: 'I really want you to explain to me what my options are. What's my escape route?'\" Costello said.\n\nCostello said Cohen also insisted that he had made the Daniels deal on his own, that Trump \"knew nothing\" about it, and that Cohen had no incriminating information about Trump he could offer to federal prosecutors.\n\n\"I swear to God, Bob. I don't have anything on Donald Trump,\" Costello quoted Cohen as saying.\n\nProsecutors countered that Costello, who was close to Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, cozied up to Cohen to keep him loyal to Trump.\n\nIn one email, Costello told Cohen: \"Sleep well tonight. you have friends in high places,\" and relayed that there were \"some very positive comments about you from the White House.\"\n\nCohen ultimately chose other lawyers.\n\nOther notable witnesses\n\nJeffrey McConney: The Trump Organization's former controller testified about working with Weisselberg to set up payments to Cohen, including reimbursement for the $130,000 payment to Daniels, a bonus and money for taxes.\n\nRhona Graff: Trump's former executive assistant testified about adding McDougal's and Daniels' contacts to Trump's contact list in the company's computer system, the latter listed simply as \"Stormy.\" Graff also said she had a \"vague recollection\" of seeing Daniels once at Trump Tower.\n\nDeborah Tarasoff: The Trump Organization's accounts payable supervisor testified about processing the payments to Cohen, including receiving checks that Trump had signed at the White House. Under defense questioning, she acknowledged permission to cut Cohen's checks came not from Trump himself, but from Weisselberg and McConney.\n\nMadeleine Westerhout: Trump's White House secretary from 2017 to 2019 testified about Trump signing checks, saying he sometimes would sign without reviewing them.\n\nAssociated Press writers Eric Tucker, Alanna Durkin Richer and Colleen Long in Washington and Michelle L.

She also testified that at one point she saw Daniels in Trump Tower on the same floor as the former president's office.\n\nFarro described what he said was Michael Cohen's frantic effort in October 2016 to create bank accounts for two shell companies, Resolution Consultants LLC and Essential Consultants LLC, which were described in applications as real estate consulting companies.\n\nFarro said that had Cohen been truthful about the purpose of the accounts -- which were created to make hush money payments as part of the catch-and-kill plan --the accounts and wire transfers would have likely been delayed or not approved.\n\nBrowning served as a custodial witness to verify two campaign videos of Trump in 2016, and one speech after Trump was elected.\n\nIn one of the videos, Trump denied any of the allegations made against him by women and suggested that the accusations could result in him losing the 2016 election. Prosecutors say that concern prompted Trump to make the Stormy Daniels hush money payment.\n\nThompson served as a custodial witness to authenticate the transcript and video from Trump's deposition in E. Jean Carroll's defamation case.\n\nDavidson testified about his role brokering the hush money payments for Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels. While Davidson testified that Cohen ultimately made Daniels' payment out of his own pocket, he said that he understood that Trump would effectively fund and be the beneficiary of the payment.\n\nDuring his testimony, jurors also heard a secretly made recording of a conversation between Davidson and Cohen, in which Cohen spoke about Trump's alleged take on the Daniels payment.\n\n\"I can't even tell you how many times he said to me, you know, 'I hate the fact that we did it.' And my comment to him was, 'But every person that you've spoken to told you it was the right move,'\" Cohen said in the recording.\n\nDaus testified as a custodial witness about his work extracting the contents of Michael Cohen's two iPhones. During Daus' testimony, prosecutors introduced into evidence a recording that Cohen secretly made of a 2016 conversation with Trump.\n\n\"I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend, David, you know, so that -- I'm going to do that right away,\" Cohen said on the recording.\n\n\"So, what do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump said in an apparent reference to the $150,000 hush money payment to Karen McDougal.\n\nLongstreet testified as a custodial witness to introduce evidence that included Donald Trump's social media posts.\n\nHicks, formerly one of Trump's most trusted advisers, told jurors that Trump told her in 2018 that he preferred the story of Stormy Daniels' affair allegations come out then, rather than before the 2016 election.\n\n\"I think Mr. Trump's opinion was it was better to be dealing with it now, and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election,\" Hicks said before breaking down on the witness stand.\n\nHicks also said Trump told her that Cohen had made the payment to Daniels on his own -- but that she doubted that was true, because, she said, \"I didn't know Michael to be an especially charitable person, or selfless person. He was the kind of person who seeks credit.\"\n\nDuring her cross-examination, Hicks helped corroborate a defense argument that Trump was a family man who cared about the impact of the allegations on his family.\n\n\"I don't think he wanted anyone in his family to be hurt or embarrassed by anything that was happening on the campaign,\" Hicks said. \"He wanted them to be proud of him.\"\n\nMcConney told jurors about his role reimbursing Michael Cohen in 2017 for his $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels and other expenses.\n\nAccording to McConney, then-Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg instructed him to approve twelve $35,000 payments to Cohen for the Daniels payment reimbursement, as well as for another reimbursement and his annual bonus.\n\nTarasoff testified about her role processing Michael Cohen's 2017 invoices, which were labeled as payment for legal services but actually reimbursed Cohen for the Daniels payment and other expenses.\n\nAccording to Tarasoff, McConney instructed her to approve the invoices as legal expenses, which she did when she processed the invoices in the Trump Organization's system.\n\nTestifying as a custodial witness, Franklin read quotes from two of Trump's books, \"Think Like a Billionaire\" and \"How to Get Rich\" that highlighted Trump's frugality and hands-on approach to business.\n\nStormy Daniels, the stage name of Stephanie Clifford, detailed her alleged sexual encounter with Trump that prosecutors say the then-Republican nominee attempted to illegally hide from voters before the 2016 election. Trump has denied the encounter ever took place.\n\n\"When I opened the bathroom door to come out, Mr. Trump had come into the bedroom and was on the bed, basically between myself and the exit,\" Daniels told jurors about the alleged 2006 sexual encounter. \"I wasn't expecting someone to be there, especially minus a lot of clothing. That's when I had that moment where I felt the room spin in slow motion. I felt the blood basically leave my hands and my feet.\"\n\nAccording to Daniels, Cohen's offer to buy her story for $130,000 in 2016 was the \"perfect solution\" because it allowed her to profit from the story without having to go public and put her safety at risk.\n\nManochio testified about the next step in the process to repay Cohen in 2017: taking unsigned checks from Tarasoff and sending them to the White House for Trump's signature.\n\nMenzies read quotes from Trump's book \"Think Big\" to highlight the former president's emphasis on loyalty.\n\nWesterhout told jurors that she normally received bundles of checks in the mail from Manochio, which she would hand to Trump for his signature. Once Trump signed the checks, Westerhout said she mailed the checks back to the Trump Organization in New York.\n\nWesterhout offered conflicting descriptions of Trump's attentiveness and intentionality when signing checks, first telling jurors that Trump examined all documents before signing them, then later testifying on cross-examination that Trump sometimes signed documents without looking them over.\n\nDixon testified as a custodian of records for AT&T, allowing prosecutors to enter Michael Cohen's cellphone records into evidence.\n\nTomalin testified as a custodial witness to allow prosecutors to get Allen Weisselberg's cellphone records into evidence.\n\nJarmel-Schneider testified that he created several summary charts to simplify the display of the phone records and the allegedly falsified business records in the case.\n\nAcross four days of testimony, Cohen testified that he was acting on Trump's orders when he worked to kill negative stories, and that he kept Trump apprised of every step along the way, telling jurors \"everything required Mr. Trump's signoff.\"\n\n\"What I was doing, I was doing at the direction and for the benefit of Mr. Trump,\" Cohen testified.\n\nCohen said he spoke with Trump more than 20 times in October 2016 to discuss how to handle the allegations from Stormy Daniels.\n\n\"He said to me, 'This is a disaster, total disaster. Women are going to hate me,'\" Cohen testified about a meeting in Trump Tower.. \"Guys may think it's cool, but this is going to be a disaster for the campaign.\"'\n\nCohen also recounted a 2017 meeting with Trump and Weisselberg in Trump Tower just days before the inauguration where Trump agreed to the plan to reimburse Cohen for the Daniels hush money payment.\n\n\"He approved it,' Cohen said. \"And he also said, 'This is going to be one heck of a ride in D.C.'\"\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche delivered his most successful blow to Cohen's credibility when he presented evidence to suggest that an Oct. 24, 2016, phone call -- which Cohen testified he made to confirm the plan to go forward with the $130,000 payment to Daniels -- was actually just Cohen complaining about a teenage prank caller to Trump's security guard.\n\nDefense lawyers also confronted Cohen about stealing $30,000 from the Trump Organization when he requested a $50,000 reimbursement for an IT expense that actually cost him $20,000.\n\nSitko testified about a summary chart he created about phone calls between defense witness Bob Costello and Michael Cohen.\n\nCostello, then a close associate of Rudy Giuliani, told jurors about his meetings and phone calls with Cohen in 2018 after FBI agents raided Cohen's office and hotel room seeking evidence in the Stormy Daniels case. Costello advised Cohen and offered to pass messages to the White House through Giuliani, according to Cohen, but Costello never formally represented Cohen as his lawyer.\n\n\"Michael Cohen said, numerous times, that President Trump knew nothing about those payments, that he did this on his own, and he repeated that numerous times,\" Costello testified about the Stormy Daniels hush money payment. But Cohen testified that he lied to Costello about Trump's involvement in the arrangement because he didn't trust him. Prosecutors also cast doubt on Costello's credibility by highlighting a series of emails that suggested he was acting to advance Trump's interests, not Cohen's.\n\nDuring one of the most dramatic moments of the trial, Judge Juan Merchan cleared the courtroom during Costello's testimony and threatened to kick Costello off the witness stand for his \"contemptuous\" conduct.\n\nFollowing Costello's testimony, the defense rested without Trump taking the stand in his own defense.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Mr Trump, who is almost certain to secure the Republican presidential nomination for November's election, is charged with falsifying business records related to paying the adult film actor Stormy Daniels $130,000 for her silence about an alleged sexual liaison.\n\nProsecutors argue that the payments amount to election interference as Mr Trump was running in the 2016 race for the White House at the time and seeking to cover up a potentially damaging scandal.\n\nBut as details of the case and Mr Trump's liaison with Ms Daniels have been brought before a Manhattan jury, they have had seemingly little impact on the 2024 race - where Mr Trump still often narrowly leads Joe Biden in head-to-head polls and is performing strongly in the swings states that are crucial to victory.\n\nMr Trump denies all the charges.\n\nThe trial has played out in remarkable scenes where Mr Trump has been in court and largely kept off the campaign trial, except at weekends and some events in and around New York City. Despite admonitions from the court, he has continued to rail against his prosecutors and Justice Juan Merchan on social media, labelling the trial as a \"witch hunt\".\n\nCentral to the case is the testimony of Mr Trump's former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen. Mr Cohen gave evidence about the role Mr Trump played in the alleged hush money scheme, but was also grilled by Mr Trump's lawyers about his previous history of lying and his evident dislike of his former boss and desire to see him behind bars.\n\nWhat weight the jury places on the reliability of Mr Cohen's testimony is likely to decide the case. If found guilty, Mr Trump could face the prospect of jail, though that is mostly seen as unlikely. Any guilty verdict would also almost certainly trigger a lengthy series of appeals.\n\nMr Trump also faces three other criminal trials: one for trying to sway the 2020 election in Georgia, another for his conduct around the January 6th attack on the Capitol and a third one related to his treatment of sensitive documents after he left the White House. However, all three have been delayed and none is seen as likely to conclude - or even start - before the presidential election. - Guardian", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_boss", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political boss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Witch-hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Buzkashi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Buzkashi", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/E6LmR6ZnLCm64tD1_AoBbQIygU0=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/CCOGSG5Z7FKL6JMROLIZFPI4II.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 2304, "textEnd": 2315}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial.\n\nAside from Ms Daniels, the key prosecution witness was Mr Michael Cohen, Trump's former \"fixer\" turned bitter foe who said he arranged the US$130,000 (S$175,000) hush money payment so her story \"would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States\".\n\nTrump's defence team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Mr Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.\n\nNone of those trials are expected to take place before the November election.

Donald J. Trump, marking the final phase of the first criminal trial of a former American president.\n\nFollowing the prosecution and defense closing statements, the judge will instruct the jury. The 12 jurors, who are ordinary New Yorkers, will then deliberate on whether the former president is guilty of the charges against him.\n\nThe defense will present its closing argument first. Trump's lead attorney, Todd Blanche, is expected to argue that District Attorney Alvin Bragg's prosecutors have not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Trump falsified business records related to a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the final days of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMr. Trump faces 34 counts of this felony charge, which carries a maximum penalty of four years in prison.\n\nIn his opening statement, Mr. Blanche asserted to the jury that \"President Trump is innocent. President Trump did not commit any crimes.\" He claimed that the money Mr. Trump paid to his then-lawyer Michael Cohen was for legal work, as shown in Mr. Trump's company records, and not for the payment to Ms. Daniels, as prosecutors and Cohen contend.\n\n\"This was not a payback,\" Mr. Blanche emphasized in his opening remarks on April 22.\n\nProsecutors are expected to argue that they have sufficiently demonstrated Mr. Trump's responsibility for falsifying business records and that he did so to cover up another crime, a necessary component for the felony charge.\n\nProsecutor Matthew Colangelo, in his opening statement, described the payment to Cohen as part of a \"planned, coordinated long-running conspiracy to influence the 2016 election, to help Donald Trump get elected through illegal expenditures, to silence people who had something bad to say about his behavior, using doctored corporate records and bank forms to conceal those payments along the way.\"\n\n\"It was election fraud. Pure and simple,\" Mr. Colangelo told the jury.\n\nOnce closing arguments are concluded, Judge Juan Merchan will instruct the jury on the relevant laws and the deliberation process, which is expected to take about an hour.

Major week looms\n\n-- Hush money, catch and kill and more: A guide to unique terms used at Trump's trial\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_instructions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury instructions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9a5768a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7376x4149+0+440/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc0%2F9d%2Fd27b9412c3dba9df315264a363ee%2Fb96fee12ddd6481db5487cd7d9f20d2d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Guilty or innocent, their decision will shake the United States.\n\nThey must decide whether the former and perhaps future president is a criminal, just months before an election that could put him back in the White House.\n\nThe panel of 12 ordinary New Yorkers will start deliberations this week and they must reach a unanimous verdict, or the case will be declared a mistrial.\n\nMuch attention has been paid to the salacious details that have emerged in the trial, particularly from porn star Stormy Daniels who alleged a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006.\n\nBut the case ultimately boils down to whether Trump knowingly covered up a $130,000 payment to Daniels for her silence in an effort to prevent her claims derailing his 2016 presidential battle against Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe jury must decide not only if Trump caused the records of payments to be falsified, but that he did so to cover up another crime -- an undeclared campaign donation in this case -- making it a felony.\n\nDepending on the judge's instructions to the jurors, the 12 panelists could be asked to consider whether the alleged cover-up was a lesser misdemeanor if the threshold for a felony conviction is not surpassed -- though this is seen as unlikely.\n\n- What are their options? -\n\nThe jury would have to agree unanimously to find Trump either guilty or not guilty.\n\nTrump's defense team has sought to sow doubts in the minds of one or two holdouts in the jury, which is all that would be needed to spare the property mogul a conviction, causing a mistrial.\n\nThe tortuous jury selection process at the start of the trial probed jurors' media consumption and feelings towards Trump in microscopic detail, revealing at least one follows the former president on his Truth Social platform.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan has come close to jailing the far-right populist for breaches of a gag order in place to protect witnesses, the jury and family members of some of those involved in the trial.\n\nBut experts say a fine, probation or community service are all far more likely options.\n\n- Would conviction impact Trump campaign? -\n\nA guilty verdict could hurt Trump's standing with \"law and order conservatives\" who could be put off by a criminal record. Religious, pro-family voters could also be deterred by the appearance that Trump cheated on his wife with a porn star.\n\nAn ABC News-Ipsos poll earlier this month found 16 percent of Trump supporters would reconsider their support for him if he were to be convicted of a felony.\n\nTrump would almost certainly appeal the conviction, kicking the issue down the road until after the election.\n\nWhatever happens, Trump can still run for president, be elected to office and once again take the presidential oath -- even if he has been convicted or even jailed.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guilt (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover-up", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cover-up"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gag order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Community service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Populism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/afp.com/06e9059b941af3ed4daff08b151be908", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

We will not just get a hung jury. We will get an acquittal.'\n\nThe twelve jurors were sworn in on April 22 after three days of wrangling between prosecution and defense lawyers.\n\nThe seven men and five women include a corporate lawyer, an investment banker, a software engineer and a teacher.\n\nThe jury foreman, when questioned about where he gets his news from, said Dailymail.com, among other outlets.\n\nBut one of the female jurors called the ex-president 'selfish' as she was questioned about her opinions in court.\n\nAnother said he follows former Trump lawyer and prosecution witness Michael Cohen on social media, as well as Mueller She Wrote, a popular anti-Trump account.\n\nAnd half of them revealed that they get at least some of their news from the left-leaning New York Times.\n\nTrump has claimed Judge Juan M. Merchan 'can't stand me', and said the trial is a political witch hunt designed to keep him off the campaign trail\n\nJoe Biden was reported to be keenly anticipating a verdict which could see Trump become the first former president ever convicted of a felony, threatening to derail his bid for the White House.\n\nThe president has avoided commenting on the case but is expected to make an address at the White House after the verdict is delivered, the WSJ reported.\n\nAnd his campaign team is planning to start referring to the former president as 'Convicted Felon Donald Trump' in its communications if the verdict is guilty.\n\nThe trial stems from a $130,000 alleged 'hush money' payment to former porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election\n\nThe case, one of four criminal cases facing Trump, centers around the claim he tried to hide a $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\nIt has been branded a political witch hunt by the former president, designed to keep him off the campaign trail.\n\nIt is also the only one likely to have come to trial by the time of November's general election.\n\nJudge Merchan, who has repeatedly clashed with Trump's defense team and issued a series of gagging orders on the former president, will deliver his instructions to the jury after both sides have concluded their summing up.\n\nHabba said the instructions serve as the 'road map' for the jury and are the most critical part of the trial.\n\n'Judge Merchan is severely conflicted,' she claimed.\n\n'At this point I have zero confidence that this person, who shouldn't be sitting on the bench right now, will give jury instructions in an appropriate manner without any persuasion towards the prosecution.\n\n'The last resort for this prosecution is this judge.'\n\nThe former president received a rapturous reception when he became the first Republican presidential candidate in 40 years to hold a rally in the Bronx, on Thursday\n\nBut he could become the first former president ever to be convicted of a felony offence when the New York jury returns its verdict on the 34 charges he is facing\n\nThe former president was given a rousing reception when he became the first Republican presidential candidate in 40 years to hold a rally in the Bronx on Thursday, and the Fox News host told his guest he was more optimistic about the jury.\n\n'I want to tell you what, there's a silver lining in this, Alina,' Duffy said.\n\n'I don't want a juror on Thursday or Friday going into Memorial Day weekend to go, you know what? I got a party going on.

Across four days, the longtime publisher of The National Enquirer, who received immunity to testify, captivated jurors with details of the tabloid world's underbelly and the August 2015 Trump Tower meeting where the hush money scheme was allegedly birthed.\n\nPecker told the court he agreed at the meeting attended by him, Trump and Cohen to be the campaign's \"eyes and ears\" -- by looking out for stories brewing that could hurt Trump's candidacy to be bought and buried, run puff pieces about him to court voters with the assistance of then-National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard, and publish hit jobs about his opponents, like that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's father had connections to Lee Harvey Oswald.\n\nAMI paid Playboy model Karen McDougal $150,000 to stay silent about her allegations of a monthslong affair with Trump not long after his marriage to Melania as part of the scheme, Pecker said. It also silenced a doorman at Trump Tower with $30,000 for his claims about Trump fathering a child out of wedlock.\n\nThe raspy-voiced media bigwig said he went back decades with Trump -- during which time the pair regularly scratched each other's backs in business -- and still considered him a friend.\n\nKeith Davidson\n\nThe lawyer who repped McDougal and Daniels in hush money negotiations described first working with AMI in summer 2016 to secure a nondisclosure deal for the Playboy model and months later being forced to deal with a frantic Cohen when AMI backed out of a plan to pay Daniels.\n\nHe said the adult film star's allegations were of sudden importance for Trump's side amid the disastrous release of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nThe Beverly Hills attorney said he felt Cohen was stringing him along when Cohen delayed sending the money, suspecting he was trying to \"kick the can down the road\" until after the election.\n\nJurors saw Daniels' $130,000 hush money contract anonymizing her and Trump's names, a side letter agreement for \"attorney's eyes only\" with their real names, and the transaction wired to Davidson's firm from a shell company Cohen set up 11 days before the election. Davidson said he assumed the presidential candidate was funding the deal.\n\nStormy Daniels\n\nIn riveting testimony across two days, Daniels, an adult film star and director, explicitly detailed her infamous alleged tryst with Trump in a Lake Tahoe hotel room in 2006 and her fear of Trump after he announced he was running.\n\nShe said she ended up at Trump's hotel room after receiving a dinner invitation from his longtime personal bodyguard, Keith Schiller when they met at a celebrity golf tournament, and walking out of Trump's hotel bathroom after an hourslong conversation to find him splayed out on the bed in his boxers.\n\nDaniels said the sex with a man \"probably older than my father\" was consensual but described blacking out and feeling disoriented.\n\n\"I was trying to think about anything other than what was happening there,\" she said.\n\nThe Louisiana native, who Trump's lawyers sought to paint as an extortionist driven by fame and money, said she was threatened by a stranger in 2011 to stay silent about Trump and that that encounter was front of mind when he announced his candidacy and when she agreed to sign a nondisclosure right before the election.\n\nMichael Cohen\n\nTrump's longtime fixer turned foe, who was federally convicted of breaking campaign finance laws for Trump in 2018 and other crimes, was the prosecution's star witness and their last one.\n\nCohen mostly corroborated others' testimony and critically described Trump as having full knowledge of the hush money payoffs and the plan to reimburse him, which prosecutors must prove. Jurors heard him and Trump appearing to discuss the McDougal payoff in a secret recording he made in September 2016.\n\nCohen said he confirmed the deal with Daniels was done with Trump in an October 2016 phone call, that President-elect Trump learned of the plan to reimburse him at Trump Tower in January 2017, which he said was dictated by Trump's convicted finance chief Allen Weisselberg, and that they discussed it again in February 2017 inside the Oval Office.\n\nThe defense sought to aggressively attack Cohen as an unreliable liar by highlighting his perjury conviction, steep profits from rebranding as a bitter Trump-hater, and motives for revenge. They elicited testimony showing he stole $30,000 from Trump's company and uncertainty about the purpose of the phone call he claimed was about Daniels situation and whether it concerned the porn star payoff or a teenage prankster.\n\nThe bookkeepers\n\nTestimony from the bookkeepers was accompanied by some of the most crucial evidence in the case -- the checks to Cohen, his invoices, and corresponding ledger entries that make up the charges.\n\nThe Trump Organization's loyal longtime former controller Jeffrey McConney, said his boss CFO Allen Weisselberg told him Cohen needed to be reimbursed in January 2017, identifying handwritten notes on a copy of Cohen's hush money bank transaction as those of his boss. Trump's side has claimed Cohen was paid for legitimate legal work, not reimbursement.\n\nThe jury saw McConney's corresponding notes on Trump letterhead that he said were jotted down when Weisselberg chucked a notepad at him.\n\nWeisselberg calculated Cohen was owed $420,000: the $130,000 he sent to Davidson for Daniels, $50,000 he paid a tech company to rig a poll in Trump's favor, then doubled to \"gross up\" for taxes. The CFO tacked on a $60,000 bonus. McConney said Cohen received it in monthly checks after billing the company for a \"retainer,\" conceding he never saw a retainer agreement.\n\nMcConney said payment came from Trump's personal bank account and partially his trust. Trump Tower bookkeepers sent the checks to Washington to be signed by the president in black Sharpie.\n\n\"Only Mr. Trump\" could sign off on checks sent out of his account even after he became president, accounts payable employee Deborah Tarasoff, a 24-year vet at the Trump Org, told the court as prosecutors sought to establish Trump knew where every penny went. Tarasoff said Trump didn't always them right away, sometimes having questions or writing \"VOID.\"\n\nCalled to the stand, Weisselberg's former assistant Rebecca Manochio said he directed her to send Trump's personal checks -- like those for Cohen and unlike others sent straight to the White House -- to his bodyguard Schiller's home address in D.C. and later Trump's top aide John McEntee.\n\nHope Hicks\n\nTrump's former White House Communications Director and campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks divulged details of Trump's knowledge of Cohen's payoff to Daniels. She said he addressed it after it was first reported in detail in February 2018, when Cohen, still loyal to Trump, denied the boss knew anything about it.\n\n\"Mr. Trump's opinion was it was better to be dealing with it now, and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election,\" Hicks said.\n\nHicks, who made clear her loyalty to Trump was enduring, admitted she found it hard to believe Cohen made the payoff out of the kindness of his heart, as Trump told her.\n\n\"I didn't know Michael to be an especially charitable person or selfless person.\"\n\nHicks also testified about the Trump campaign's panic over the release of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, which prosecutors say was the motivation behind the hasty hush money payoff to Daniels.\n\nDefense witnesses\n\nTrump's side called two witnesses, veteran defense attorney Bob Costello and a paralegal.\n\nA longtime associate of Trump adviser and former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Costello informally advised Trump's fixer after the feds began investigating him. He claimed Cohen told him then that Trump \"knew nothing\" about the Daniels payoff.\n\nOn cross-examination, prosecutor Susan Hoffinger sought to establish Costello was part of a \"pressure campaign\" to stop Cohen from flipping on Trump, with Cohen testifying that he didn't trust the attorney, who dangled a \"backchannel\" to the White House, not to relay what he told him to the boss.\n\n\"Our issue is to get Cohen on the right page without giving him the appearance that we are following instructions from Giuliani or the president,\" read one email from Costello to his law partner showed to the jury during his cross-examination.\n\nJurors saw Trump's tweets lauding his fixer after his places were raided by the feds in April 2018 -- saying he was confident he wouldn't flip -- and then saying he wouldn't recommend him as a lawyer after he pleaded guilty.", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Now, as the trial reaches its conclusion with the jury set to begin deliberations next week, it is the perfect opportunity to evaluate the key participants -- and to hand out grades as they head into closing arguments.\n\nSo, without further ado, here is their interim report card.\n\nJudge Merchan: C+\n\nActing Justice of the New York State Supreme Court Juan Merchan was wise during the jury selection to allow potential jurors to articulate for themselves whether or not they could be fair. This greatly reduced the time it took for the parties to seat a jury, as there was no time wasted in follow-up questions challenging the fairness assertion.\n\nThe Judge, however, faltered in his Sandoval rulings by deciding that, if Trump testified, then the recent civil verdicts against Trump would be fair game on cross-examination. Should Trump be convicted, the Judge, through this ruling, has given the Trump Team a strong appeal issue, especially given Trump's decision not to testify despite indicating, outside of court, that he would like to.\n\nBut, overall, the judge kept the case moving, and this raised his grade from a solid C to a C+.\n\nProsecution Team: B\n\nIt appears that the prosecutors made the wise decision to put off the testimony of Michael Cohen as long as possible. This allowed them to shore up Cohen's testimony on the front end, through the testimony of other witnesses. Although it was a tough task, they missed two significant opportunities to address problems on direct examination with Cohen.\n\nFirst, there was no mention on direct examination of the text from Cohen to Trump's bodyguard in which Cohen expressed concerns about being harassed yet said nothing about hush money. Second, the prosecution missed an opportunity to clearly explain to the jury on direct examination of Cohen that he charged the Trump organization $50,000 for a vendor, when Cohen had actually only paid the vendor $20,000. These omissions by the prosecution allowed the defense team to spring these \"gotcha\" moments on Cohen, without any preemption by the prosecutors. These mistakes regarding their star witness dropped the prosecution grade from an A- to a B.\n\nDefense Team: B\n\nThe defense team had a great cross-examination of Michael Cohen, and this will give them a leg up on getting an acquittal. They can argue effectively that Trump cannot be convicted unless you believe Cohen, and nothing that Cohen said was truthful.\n\nHowever, the Trump Team didn't do so well with Stormy Daniels -- it was an unforced error to allow her to go on and on about her alleged affair with Trump. And the decision to put Robert Costello on the stand may also have been a mistake, as he was too chippy with the Judge and failed to deliver a solid explanation for his prior emails.\n\nUnlike the prosecution team, the Trump legal team pulled its grade up from the low C/high D range to a B -- all thanks to the cross-examination of Cohen.\n\nThe Jury: A\n\nSo far, no juror has been dropped from the case. By all accounts they are attentive and locked into everything that is happening in the trial. I predict that they will remain a cohesive unit and will reach a verdict. At the outset of the trial, many predicted jurors would drop off the case because of the pressure. The opposite has proven to be true, and the jurors have risen to the challenge. Thus, they have earned a solid A.\n\nSketch Artists: B+\n\nWe all would have benefited from seeing the testimony in this case live, as it happened. Unfortunately, though, cameras were not permitted in the courtroom because New York law limits the use of cameras in legal proceedings. As a result of this ban, courtroom sketch artists have distilled what is going on into colorful portraits, depicting both the players and the mood in the room at key stages in the trial. It won't take much to push their B+ grade into the A range, and I think they will get it. It's just a shade off right now.\n\nThe hush-money participants have now received their grades as they are heading into their final exam. It's no secret that closing arguments, jury instructions, and the verdict present each participant opportunities to raise or lower their grade. But they should know I am a tough grader.\n\nJohn P.

So it stands to reason that his *lawyer* and spokesperson, Alina Habba, was on the airwaves in a cocktail dress prepping MAGA for a disappointment. And what disappointment? The disappointment of realizing that they've been backing a total fraud lo these many years and giving their hard earned cash to a grifter? No. Possibly, in the fullness of time, that realization will come. But for right now, it's the judge's fault. Oh, and there are no \"facts.\" Righto.\n\nPolitico has a piece up, \"We're on the cusp of a Trump verdict.\" Indeed we are. And that verdict, coming days after Trump's horrific showing at the Libertarian Convention on Saturday, could be a life changer. The large font is the question that was posed to a panel of experts and regular text the reply.\n\nFeuerherd: I think the substance of his testimony probably helped prosecutors make the point that they wanted to make -- that Costello wanted to have this relationship with Cohen to create this backchannel to the Trump team and ultimately, to feed information to [Trump personal attorney] Rudy Giuliani and then on to Trump. Prosecutors might use that and say that the fact that Trump wanted to keep Cohen in the fold after the FBI raided him in 2018 is evidence that Trump knew that Cohen may have damaging information or that the investigation may come back to him, and that maybe he did something wrong with Cohen.\n\nFeuerherd: Costello said Cohen told him that Cohen didn't believe he had anything on Trump in these meetings and these phone calls that he had in 2018, but I feel like that's going to be a hard pill to swallow for the jury.\n\nOrden: I was not surprised. In addition to all of the downsides that many people have discussed regarding how he would be cross-examined and what he would be cross examined on, I think it's instructive to look at these other two times that he testified.\n\nThe first time was in the civil fraud case, and there was no jury, and Judge [Arthur] Engoron gave him a long leash on that testimony, he let him insult him to his face and go off on all sorts of tangents in his testimony. [...]\n\nGerstein: It matters to the credibility of both sides at this point, but there's not going to be a box on the verdict form that says, \"Did Trump have sex with Stormy Daniels?\" The truth will be part of the public assessment and the ultimate verdict in the court of public opinion, but for the jury, it's not that critical. [...]\n\nFeuerherd: It's sort of like one of these classic things where one day you hear the direct examination, and you're like, \"Oh, wow, they really hit it out of the park.\" And then the next day you hear the cross and you're like, \"Oh my gosh, they really hit it out of the park.\"\n\nThe prosecutors laid out through Cohen's testimony the story that there was this hush money payment that was directed by Trump. Trump was literally in the room with Allen Weisselberg [the former Trump Organization CFO] and Cohen, when they told Cohen they'd reimburse him and when Weisselberg said, \"This is how you're going to get reimbursed. And here's the math.\"\n\nAnd then later, according to Cohen, he met with Trump in the Oval Office, and Trump acknowledged this reimbursement scheme again.\n\nThat seems to be crucial testimony to the case, but then you have, obviously, these legitimacy issues with Cohen that were beaten to death by Blanche in a cross that jumped all over the place constantly.\n\nAnd then you had this dramatic moment with Blanche presenting Cohen with this Oct. 24 call in 2016 and saying, \"You know, are you sure that you called Trump's bodyguard, Keith Schiller, and then Schiller handed Trump the phone, and then you can confirm that this happened?\" The defense argued that Cohen was getting harassed by someone who purported to be a 14-year-old and he was actually calling Schiller because he wanted to get that handled -- not to undermine the 2016 election.\n\nFeuerherd: There was definitely an audible gasp.\n\nOrden: It was also hard not to. Todd Blanche was practically shrieking at that point, so even if you weren't paying attention, you would have started because his delivery was noticeable.\n\nThis reminds me of a comment that Al Gore made once. He said, \"If the facts are on your side, argue the facts. If the law is on your side, argue the law. If neither are on your side -- holler.\" That's what Todd Blanche did.\n\nAnd here's another clip of Habba setting up the cult for a letdown. She's complaining that the jury hasn't been sequestered and they're going to be partying with their friends who suffer from Trump derangement syndrome this holiday weekend. But for that, the jury would acquit.\n\nSpeculation is all we have at this point. The prosecution put on a meticulous, fact filled case, despite what Habba claims. The paper trail is obvious and compelling. Trump's propensity for micromanagement is going to bite him in the butt, because it is totally believable that he knew what was happening every step of the way.\n\nThe comment has been made many places that maybe Michael Cohen admitting he stole from the Trump Organization will hurt him or his credibility. I don't think so. I think the important thing to realize here is that nobody in this scenario is a saint. All the characters are a bit dirty. The prosecution had to put on Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen and they did. I think both of them did very well on the stand. Whether Cohen stole money out of a sense of spite for his bonus not being large enough or whether Stormy talks to the dead does not mean that they aren't telling the truth about this one narrow set of circumstances.\n\nIf the jury follows the instructions given and matches the evidence to each element of the crimes alleged, I think Trump is toast. And then let's see the GOP defend having a convicted felon on their ticket. And, in a worse case scenario where Trump is acquitted or there's a hung jury, the prosecution has a good case for a retrial, based on Bob Costello's histrionics and contempt for the judge.

The case will soon be in the hands of the jury.\n\nWho holds the advantage at this critical juncture? My assessment, after attending much of the trial in person, is that it's the prosecution's case to lose.\n\nWith the standing caveat that it takes only one juror to block a unanimous guilty verdict -- and that the law puts the greatest burden on prosecutors -- the case as it has come in puts the district attorney's office in the driver's seat going into next week's closing arguments.\n\nThe prosecution's essential achievement was to provide a compelling, credible narrative that points toward only one plausible conclusion: that Trump is guilty as charged.\n\nThe defense, by contrast, took a scattershot approach focused on undermining the credibility of any and all of the prosecution's witnesses, particularly Michael Cohen, Trump's former attorney and fixer. But what Trump's lawyers didn't do is provide a counternarrative, a story compelling enough to leave jurors with a reasonable doubt as to which explanation of the facts is true.\n\nProviding such a competing story isn't the defense's legal obligation, of course. The judge will instruct the jurors that if they have any reasonable doubt about the prosecution's case, they should vote to acquit.\n\nBut my experience as a trial lawyer suggests a difference between free-standing doubt about one or more witnesses and a broader doubt about the rationale behind the charges -- an alternative plotline that jurors might find believable. That's the kind of defense being presented on behalf of Sen. Robert Menendez, for example, who is arguing that his wife is the guilty party.\n\nFrom the first day of testimony, the prosecution has presented a tight, persuasive tale. It begins with an August 2015 meeting involving Trump, Cohen and tabloid executive David Pecker -- who explained it to the jury from the stand -- in which the parties agreed on a scheme to smother negative stories about Trump.\n\nAnd sure enough, before the next year's election, a series of scandalmongers required neutralizing to insulate Trump from political damage. These episodes are akin to Acts II and III of the script, falling into place along the tracks that the Pecker testimony laid.\n\nHope Hicks' testimony was brief but powerful given her longtime loyal service to Trump and her obvious candor notwithstanding her reluctance to harm her former boss, which seemed to cause her to break into tears. She confirmed in dramatic terms that Cohen and Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization's then-chief financial officer, would not have cooked up the scheme to pay off the adult-film actor Stormy Daniels without Trump's say-so.\n\nThe prosecution effectively corroborated in advance most of what would come from its last and most important witness, Cohen. At the same time, the prosecutors encouraged their own witnesses to disparage Cohen, lowering expectations before he took the stand.\n\nWhen he did, Cohen was low-key, responsive and agreeable. With a few exceptions, he accepted the insults the defense served up, accounting for most of the discrepancies in his story by explaining that he had been telling the truth since he left the Trump fold.\n\nA couple of low points in Cohen's testimony got a lot of attention, and it's natural for the media to zero in on dramatic moments. But the jury is more likely to evaluate the evidence in the context of the whole narrative and a witness' general comportment.\n\nMost important, jurors, like all of us, make overall judgments about credibility, which is the heart and soul of the jury system. Taking the measure of the people before them, they decide whether their accounts are basically trustworthy, notwithstanding the defects of the messengers. And all the stories in this case -- not just Cohen's but those of other flawed witnesses such as Pecker and Daniels -- cohere and ring true.\n\nIt follows that the impertinence of Robert Costello, a defense witness who muttered in disagreement with Judge Juan M. Merchan's rulings, probably caught the jury's attention more than the flaws in Cohen's largely even presentation -- especially once Merchan forcefully rebuked Costello's buffoonish grandstanding.\n\nThe prosecution's cross-examination of Costello and redirect of both Cohen and Daniels were crisp, clear, textbook demolitions of the defense's points. Trump's team was more meandering and given to stray potshots, missing more than they hit.\n\nI think the defense still has one largely overlooked escape hatch: the arcane legal instructions for deciding the felony charges. The charges require the prosecution to prove that Trump caused the alleged falsification of documents to further another crime. Prosecutors have offered up three different candidates for that other crime, each of which has flaws. I could see the jury, which includes two lawyers, considering the legal instructions very carefully and finding that the district attorney came up short. And in any event, the issue is sure to figure in an appeal.\n\nBut any appeal feels a millennium away. By the time that transpires, Trump will either be president, giving him extensive options for evading accountability, or a losing candidate facing three other criminal trials. This trial looks increasingly likely to be the only opportunity for a jury to decide for the first time whether a former president is a criminal. Going into the final act, I like the chances that he will be found guilty.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_boss", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crime boss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pecker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Pecker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Weisselberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allen Weisselberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hope Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Menendez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bob Menendez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tabloid journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tsr-trump-littman.jpg?d=1020x655", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-08-", "textStart": 1890, "textEnd": 1901}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Believe your lying eyes is what's going to happen in the jury room,\" he said. \"They don't have to use anything that Michael Cohen said.\"\n\n\"All the jury has to do is believe [Weisselberg's] document and know that they were reimbursements that Michael Cohen was paid back for what he advanced for the crime of paying off Ms. Daniels before the election,\" he added. \"And that's enough for them to convict beyond a reasonable doubt without relying on Michael Cohen at all.\"\n\nDespite his confidence in the evidence, Davis did not predict an outcome to the case. Closing arguments will begin Tuesday and jury deliberations immediately after.\n\nIf he is convicted, Trump could face as much as four years in prison, as well as be named a felon. Davis called the claims against the former president, also the presumptive GOP nominee for the White House, an \"impairment of our democracy.\"\n\n\"There's plenty of evidence here for the jury to convict beyond a reasonable doubt,\" Davis said. \"But whatever happens, I will respect the jury's verdict.\"", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_robertson@miamiherald.com", "name": "Nick Robertson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanny_Davis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lanny Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pecker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Pecker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hope Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deliberation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Sharpton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al Sharpton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Weisselberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allen Weisselberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letitia_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Letitia James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence_Based_Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence Based Medicine", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/kc4syi/picture288788010/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/91a7c400-7bd8-4f4c-bd22-62d7fc753a95", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-02-", "textStart": 1368, "textEnd": 1381}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Trump: closing arguments.\n\nAlso known as summations, closing arguments give each side several hours to highlight the evidence that best proves its case. While similar to the opening statements delivered at a trial's start, closing arguments tend to be more forceful -- and therefore more memorable. They are meant to leave a lasting impression on jurors as they start deliberations.\n\nProsecutors at the Manhattan district attorney's office have charged Mr. Trump with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up a $130,000 hush-money payment to the porn star Stormy Daniels, who says she had a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. They argue this was part of a larger scheme to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMr. Trump has denied the charges and having sex with Ms. Daniels. Because of the rules in New York state courts, his lawyers will deliver their closing argument first.\n\nMr. Trump's lawyers will inevitably attack what they perceive to be problems with the prosecutors' case. They will flag possible gaps or shortcomings in evidence. They will also seek to remind the jurors of credibility issues with the witnesses who have testified, most likely focusing on two key witnesses for the prosecutors: Trump's former lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, and Ms. Daniels.\n\nThey are likely to argue that prosecutors have not met their burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt -- the highest burden of proof in the U.S. legal system -- that Mr. Trump committed these crimes, and will ask the jury to acquit him.\n\nIt will then be the prosecutors' turn. With this heavy burden in mind, they will strive to paint a clear picture of the crime, weaving in witness testimony and documents, to persuade the jury that there is only one outcome that the evidence supports: guilty on all 34 counts.\n\nWhen both sides have finished, the judge, Juan M. Merchan, will instruct the jurors on the law and how to apply it to the evidence, and they will be sent off to deliberate.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opening statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burden of proof (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence_Based_Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence Based Medicine", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/28/multimedia/28trump-trial-closings-explainer-bqzm/28trump-trial-closings-explainer-bqzm-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Trump, who is almost certain to secure the Republican presidential nomination, is accused of falsifying business records related to paying $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels for her silence about an alleged sexual affair .\n\nProsecutors say the payments constitute election interference because Trump was then a candidate in the 2016 White House race and sought to cover up a potentially damaging scandal.\n\nBut as the details of the affair and Trump's affair with Daniels were brought before a Manhattan jury, they apparently had little impact on the 2024 race, where Trump still often narrowly leads Joe Biden in the polls face-to-face and performs well in elections. swing states that are crucial to victory.\n\nTrump denies all accusations.\n\nThe trial featured notable scenes where Trump was in court and largely avoided the campaign trial except on weekends and some events in and around New York City. Despite the court's reprimands, he continued to attack his prosecutors and Judge Juan Merchan on social media, calling the trial a witch hunt.\n\nAt the heart of the case is the testimony of former Trump lawyer and once-feared fixer Michael Cohen. Cohen provided vital evidence of the role Trump played in the alleged secrecy scheme, but was also brutally questioned by Trump's lawyers for his history of lies and his obvious dislike for his former boss and his desire to see him behind bars.\n\nThe weight the jury places on the reliability of Cohen's testimony is likely to decide the case one way or the other. If convicted, Trump could face prison time, although that is generally considered unlikely. Any guilty verdict would almost certainly trigger a lengthy series of appeals.\n\nStay informed about all Donald Trump trials.

She also testified that at one point she saw Daniels in Trump Tower on the same floor as the former president's office.\n\nGary Farro, former Managing Director at First Republic Bank\n\nFarro described what he said was Michael Cohen's frantic effort in October 2016 to create bank accounts for two shell companies, Resolution Consultants LLC and Essential Consultants LLC, which were described in applications as real estate consulting companies.\n\nFarro said that had Cohen been truthful about the purpose of the accounts -- which were created to make hush money payments as part of the catch-and-kill plan --the accounts and wire transfers would have likely been delayed or not approved.\n\nRobert Browning, Executive Director of C-SPAN Archives\n\nBrowning served as a custodial witness to verify two campaign videos of Trump in 2016, and one speech after Trump was elected.\n\nIn one of the videos, Trump denied any of the allegations made against him by women and suggested that the accusations could result in him losing the 2016 election. Prosecutors say that concern prompted Trump to make the Stormy Daniels hush money payment.\n\nPhilip Thompson, Esquire Deposition Solutions\n\nThompson served as a custodial witness to authenticate the transcript and video from Trump's deposition in E. Jean Carroll's defamation case.\n\nKeith Davidson, ex-attorney for Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels\n\nDavidson testified about his role brokering the hush money payments for Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels. While Davidson testified that Cohen ultimately made Daniels' payment out of his own pocket, he said that he understood that Trump would effectively fund and be the beneficiary of the payment.\n\nDuring his testimony, jurors also heard a secretly made recording of a conversation between Davidson and Cohen, in which Cohen spoke about Trump's alleged take on the Daniels payment.\n\n\"I can't even tell you how many times he said to me, you know, 'I hate the fact that we did it.' And my comment to him was, 'But every person that you've spoken to told you it was the right move,'\" Cohen said in the recording.\n\nDouglas Daus, Analyst for Manhattan DA's Office\n\nDaus testified as a custodial witness about his work extracting the contents of Michael Cohen's two iPhones. During Daus' testimony, prosecutors introduced into evidence a recording that Cohen secretly made of a 2016 conversation with Trump.\n\n\"I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend, David, you know, so that -- I'm going to do that right away,\" Cohen said on the recording.\n\n\"So, what do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump said in an apparent reference to the $150,000 hush money payment to Karen McDougal.\n\nGeorgia Longstreet, Paralegal for Manhattan DA's Office\n\nLongstreet testified as a custodial witness to introduce evidence that included Donald Trump's social media posts.\n\nHope Hicks, former White House Communications Director\n\nHicks, formerly one of Trump's most trusted advisers, told jurors that Trump told her in 2018 that he preferred the story of Stormy Daniels' affair allegations come out then, rather than before the 2016 election.\n\n\"I think Mr. Trump's opinion was it was better to be dealing with it now, and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election,\" Hicks said before breaking down on the witness stand.\n\nHicks also said Trump told her that Cohen had made the payment to Daniels on his own -- but that she doubted that was true, because, she said, \"I didn't know Michael to be an especially charitable person, or selfless person. He was the kind of person who seeks credit.\"\n\nDuring her cross-examination, Hicks helped corroborate a defense argument that Trump was a family man who cared about the impact of the allegations on his family.\n\n\"I don't think he wanted anyone in his family to be hurt or embarrassed by anything that was happening on the campaign,\" Hicks said. \"He wanted them to be proud of him.\"\n\nJeffrey McConney, Former Trump Organization Controller\n\nMcConney told jurors about his role reimbursing Michael Cohen in 2017 for his $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels and other expenses.\n\nAccording to McConney, then-Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg instructed him to approve twelve $35,000 payments to Cohen for the Daniels payment reimbursement, as well as for another reimbursement and his annual bonus.\n\nDeborah Tarasoff, Trump Organization Accounts Payable Supervisor\n\nTarasoff testified about her role processing Michael Cohen's 2017 invoices, which were labeled as payment for legal services but actually reimbursed Cohen for the Daniels payment and other expenses.\n\nAccording to Tarasoff, McConney instructed her to approve the invoices as legal expenses, which she did when she processed the invoices in the Trump Organization's system.\n\nSally Franklin, Penguin Random House Executive\n\nTestifying as a custodial witness, Franklin read quotes from two of Trump's books, \"Think Like a Billionaire\" and \"How to Get Rich\" that highlighted Trump's frugality and hands-on approach to business.\n\nStormy Daniels, Adult Film Actress and Producer\n\nStormy Daniels, the stage name of Stephanie Clifford, detailed her alleged sexual encounter with Trump that prosecutors say the then-Republican nominee attempted to illegally hide from voters before the 2016 election. Trump has denied the encounter ever took place.\n\n\"When I opened the bathroom door to come out, Mr. Trump had come into the bedroom and was on the bed, basically between myself and the exit,\" Daniels told jurors about the alleged 2006 sexual encounter. \"I wasn't expecting someone to be there, especially minus a lot of clothing. That's when I had that moment where I felt the room spin in slow motion. I felt the blood basically leave my hands and my feet.\"\n\nAccording to Daniels, Cohen's offer to buy her story for $130,000 in 2016 was the \"perfect solution\" because it allowed her to profit from the story without having to go public and put her safety at risk.\n\nRebecca Manochio, Trump Organization Junior Bookkeeper\n\nManochio testified about the next step in the process to repay Cohen in 2017: taking unsigned checks from Tarasoff and sending them to the White House for Trump's signature.\n\nTracy Menzies, HarperCollins Executive\n\nMenzies read quotes from Trump's book \"Think Big\" to highlight the former president's emphasis on loyalty.\n\nMadeleine Westerhout, Former Director of Oval Office Operations\n\nWesterhout told jurors that she normally received bundles of checks in the mail from Manochio, which she would hand to Trump for his signature. Once Trump signed the checks, Westerhout said she mailed the checks back to the Trump Organization in New York.\n\nWesterhout offered conflicting descriptions of Trump's attentiveness and intentionality when signing checks, first telling jurors that Trump examined all documents before signing them, then later testifying on cross-examination that Trump sometimes signed documents without looking them over.\n\nDaniel Dixon, Analyst for AT&T\n\nDixon testified as a custodian of records for AT&T, allowing prosecutors to enter Michael Cohen's cellphone records into evidence.\n\nJenny Tomalin, Analyst for Verizon\n\nTomalin testified as a custodial witness to allow prosecutors to get Allen Weisselberg's cellphone records into evidence.\n\nJaden Jarmel-Schneider, Paralegal for Manhattan DA's Office\n\nJarmel-Schneider testified that he created several summary charts to simplify the display of the phone records and the allegedly falsified business records in the case.\n\nMichael Cohen, Trump's Former Attorney\n\nAcross four days of testimony, Cohen testified that he was acting on Trump's orders when he worked to kill negative stories, and that he kept Trump apprised of every step along the way, telling jurors \"everything required Mr. Trump's signoff.\"\n\n\"What I was doing, I was doing at the direction and for the benefit of Mr. Trump,\" Cohen testified.\n\nCohen said he spoke with Trump more than 20 times in October 2016 to discuss how to handle the allegations from Stormy Daniels.\n\n\"He said to me, 'This is a disaster, total disaster. Women are going to hate me,'\" Cohen testified about a meeting in Trump Tower.. \"Guys may think it's cool, but this is going to be a disaster for the campaign.\"'\n\nCohen also recounted a 2017 meeting with Trump and Weisselberg in Trump Tower just days before the inauguration where Trump agreed to the plan to reimburse Cohen for the Daniels hush money payment.\n\n\"He approved it,' Cohen said. \"And he also said, 'This is going to be one heck of a ride in D.C.'\"\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche delivered his most successful blow to Cohen's credibility when he presented evidence to suggest that an Oct. 24, 2016, phone call -- which Cohen testified he made to confirm the plan to go forward with the $130,000 payment to Daniels -- was actually just Cohen complaining about a teenage prank caller to Trump's security guard.\n\nDefense lawyers also confronted Cohen about stealing $30,000 from the Trump Organization when he requested a $50,000 reimbursement for an IT expense that actually cost him $20,000.\n\nDaniel Sitko, Legal Analyst at Blanche Law\n\nSitko testified about a summary chart he created about phone calls between defense witness Bob Costello and Michael Cohen.\n\nRobert Costello, Former Legal Adviser to Michael Cohen\n\nCostello, then a close associate of Rudy Giuliani, told jurors about his meetings and phone calls with Cohen in 2018 after FBI agents raided Cohen's office and hotel room seeking evidence in the Stormy Daniels case. Costello advised Cohen and offered to pass messages to the White House through Giuliani, according to Cohen, but Costello never formally represented Cohen as his lawyer.\n\n\"Michael Cohen said, numerous times, that President Trump knew nothing about those payments, that he did this on his own, and he repeated that numerous times,\" Costello testified about the Stormy Daniels hush money payment. But Cohen testified that he lied to Costello about Trump's involvement in the arrangement because he didn't trust him. Prosecutors also cast doubt on Costello's credibility by highlighting a series of emails that suggested he was acting to advance Trump's interests, not Cohen's.\n\nDuring one of the most dramatic moments of the trial, Judge Juan Merchan cleared the courtroom during Costello's testimony and threatened to kick Costello off the witness stand for his \"contemptuous\" conduct.\n\nFollowing Costello's testimony, the defense rested without Trump taking the stand in his own defense.", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But prosecutors argue that Mr Trump - who was the president at the time - was actually reimbursing his \"fixer\" for a hush money payment to Ms Daniels.\n\nProsecutors must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Mr Trump not only falsified business records, but did so with the intent to commit or cover up another crime.\n\nProsecutors will likely walk jurors through that scheme one last time, and explain how that central fraud violated state and federal campaign finance law, tax law, and a state law against conspiracy to corrupt an election by \"unlawful means.\"\n\nDefense attorneys do not have to prove anything or convince jurors of Mr Trump's innocence, but they will need to convince at least one juror that prosecutors have not proved his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nMr Trump's lawyers have argued that Cohen was merely paid for his work as the former president's then-personal attorney, and that the hush money scheme - which itself was not illegal - was only to prevent embarrassing news of his affairs from getting to Mr Trump's family, not in an attempt to hide them from voters.\n\nWhen does the jury deliberate?\n\nBefore jurors are sent out of the courtroom to deliberate, Justice Juan Merchan will give them instructions - a framework for understanding the law surrounding the charges and what they can and cannot take into account as they determine his guilt or innocence.\n\nProsecutors and defense attorneys debated the contours of those instructions and proposed their own during a two-hour hearing last week.\n\nJudge Merchan is expected to deliver those instructions on Wednesday morning before sending jurors off to deliberate in an undisclosed room in the courthouse.\n\nJurors will be able to pass notes to the judge for things like clarifying legal language or reviewing testimony.\n\nBut how long they will take to deliberate is anyone's guess. The 12 jurors must unanimously agree on a guilty or not guilty verdict.\n\nIf they can't reach a consensus after several days of deliberations, the judge will likely ask them to keep trying.

This includes lawyers, judges, and, most certainly, political commentators.\n\nThis is the mystery of the truth-divination system we call a criminal justice system. We let two white knights (the presumption of innocence clothes both prosecution and defense in white) joust and whoever wins is determined to be representing the side of truth. Juries decide which side wins.\n\nAfter the Trump trial verdict, we will never know exactly what factored into the jury's decision -- whether it be conviction, acquittal or hung jury -- because no one account can capture even how one human mind makes decisions, much less twelve of them.\n\nBut here's what to watch for.\n\nThe prosecution bears the burden of proof and in some jurisdictions that means they go first and last -- meaning the prosecution gets to rebut the defense. However, in New York, the defense goes first and then the prosecution -- no rebuttal. Then judge Juan Merchan will instruct the jury on the law before giving them the case to decide.\n\nThe best defense closings are not scattergun approaches that rely upon lofty rhetoric or anecdotes about the meaning of reasonable doubt. Nor do they talk much about the prosecution bearing the burden of proof and the fact that a defendant is presumed innocent. The reality is defendants tend to face a \"presumed guilty\" attitude that the defense must overcome. To do so, defense counsel needs to present a coherent theory or theories. For example, the defendant wasn't present at the crime scene and the eyewitnesses are suspect because they either have bad eyesight or are biased against the defendant. What the defense should not do is present multiple, conflicting defenses: The defendant was not present at the murder scene, but if they were then it was self-defense.\n\nThus far, Trump's defense team seems to use a throw-everything-at-the-kitchen-wall strategy with a particular emphasis on Trump's favorite foods: insult and shame. The cross-examination of Stormy Daniels tried to discredit her not through inconsistencies in her testimony but by trying to make the jury believe that her acting and directing were shameful pursuits that should preclude anyone from thinking she can tell the truth. It didn't go well for the defense. Daniels came across as genuine and smart and slam-dunked a few times right in the defense counsel's face.\n\nFor Michael Cohen, the defense seemed to have so embraced the media and former Trump attorneys' disparagement of Cohen's honesty that they focused on calling him a liar instead of showing the jury where he might have been wrong or lied.\n\nTo salvage their inept case, the defense needs to give a closing which is tightly focused on facts and not their client's penchant for insult. The best way for them to treat the Stormy Daniels testimony is to argue it is not really relevant to whether Trump engaged in falsification of business records since she has no knowledge of accounting details. If, on the other hand, they try to satisfy Trump by arguing that the sexual encounter never took place, then they not only put the jury's focus on a legally irrelevant factor but also risk setting up a credibility contest between Trump and Daniels. That's not a contest Trump is likely to win. With Michael Cohen, they need to play up the slim amount of testimony that Trump gave specific instructions given to falsify the reimbursements to Cohen as legal invoices.\n\nThat leads to the defense's strongest argument, which is that there is insufficient evidence of Trump directing or knowing how the reimbursements were recorded. It's their best argument because it attacks the foundation of the case. The prosecution theory requires the misdemeanor falsification being proven and then proof that the falsification was meant to further another crime: election interference. So without a determination by the jury that Trump knew about the falsification then the prosecution cannot win. Such an approach allows the defense to parry the onslaught of records and testimony -- some by witnesses sympathetic to Trump -- evidencing that the falsification happened and Trump likely knew about it.\n\nIn contrast, the prosecution has an abundance of actual evidence -- versus personal attacks -- to use in its closing, but the evidence must be carefully woven into a simple tale the jury understands. Something along the lines of: Trump tried to cover up his payments to cover up his sexual encounter because he worried the publicity might hurt his election chances. The timeline they walk the jury through needs to be both easy to follow and densely documented by supporting evidence.\n\nStormy Daniels' testimony will be a gift to the prosecution's closing. They can simply reference it as part of the story and let her excellent performance speak to the contrast in credibility between her and the defense arguments as well as the defense witness Robert Costello -- who came across as so arrogant and disrespectful that Judge Juan Merchan had to dress him down after clearing the courtroom.\n\nMichael Cohen should be used by the prosecution as both a guide to and a victim of Trump's world. Cohen weathered his cross-examination well and the prosecution would be smart to reference his testimony without any defensiveness. Certainly any snark thrown at Cohen by the defense can be handled by prosecutors literally pointing to Trump and saying: \"If you don't like Michael Cohen, if you found what he did to be distasteful, then just remember who hired him.\"\n\nThe jury instructions -- which we have not yet seen -- sound like they will be particularly helpful to the prosecution on the element of \"unlawful means.\" Namely, the judge will not require the jury to agree unanimously on which unlawful means were used in the crime. Some jurors may conclude that tax fraud arising from Trump's treatment of the reimbursements as invoices paid to Cohen was the unlawful means for the case while others may conclude that the unlawful means was that the falsification concealed what should have been reported to the Federal Election Commission as an \"in-kind\" campaign contribution.\n\nThis lack of a unanimity requirement is very helpful to the prosecution because the jury can pick and sample as it chooses from evidence of unlawful means without having to agree on only one. This also provides insulation on appeal should there be a conviction.\n\nAs one experienced legal commentator has observed: \"Juries surprise -- sometimes.\" The New York Trump jury is no exception. They may acquit or they may hang. But for me, any outcome other than a conviction will be a surprise given how the prosecution's evidence has been presented, combined with the likelihood that Trump's defense team will likely continue its scattergun tactics in their closing.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Burden of proof (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defense (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presumption of innocence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_scene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crime scene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shotgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_instructions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury instructions"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1716782904/240526-wu-trump-tease_yapt2k", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The defense called just two. Trump decided not to testify on his own behalf.\n\nThe trial now shifts to closing arguments, scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nAfter that, it will be up to 12 jurors to decide whether prosecutors have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified his company's business records as part of a broader effort to keep stories about marital infidelity from becoming public during his 2016 presidential campaign. He has pleaded not guilty and denies any wrongdoing.\n\nA conviction could come down to how the jurors interpret the testimony and which witnesses they find credible. The jury must be unanimous. The records involved include 11 checks sent to Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, as well as invoices and company ledger entries related to those payments.\n\nA critical moment will take place, perhaps Wednesday morning, before the jury begins its deliberations.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nIn an indication of just how important those instructions are, prosecutors and defense lawyers had a spirited debate last week outside the jury's presence as they sought to persuade Merchan about the instructions he should give.\n\nThe Trump team, for instance, sought an instruction informing jurors that the types of hush money payments at issue in Trump's case are not inherently illegal, a request a prosecutor called \"totally inappropriate.\" Merchan said such an instruction would go too far and is unnecessary.\n\nTrump's team also asked Merchan to consider the \"extraordinarily important\" nature of the case when issuing his instructions and to urge jurors to reach \"very specific findings.\" Prosecutors objected to that as well, and Merchan agreed that it would be wrong to deviate from the standard instructions.\n\n\"When you say it's a very important case, you're asking me to change the law, and I'm not going to do that,\" Merchan said.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, requested an instruction that someone's status as a candidate doesn't need to be the sole motivation for making a payment that benefits the campaign. Defense lawyers asked for jurors to be told that if a payment would have been made even if the person wasn't running, it shouldn't be treated as a campaign contribution.\n\nHave a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\n\"So, what do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump asks his attorney and \"fixer,\" Cohen, just two months before the 2016 election. \"Pay with cash,\" Trump then instructs.\n\nThis phone conversation, secretly recorded by Cohen, catches Trump calling the shots as the two men discuss financing for a $150,000 hush-money payment. The hush money was meant to keep voters in the dark about former Playboy model Karen McDougal's claim -- denied by Trump -- of a nearly yearlong affair with the then-Apprentice star in 2006.\n\nWhy is this taped Trump-Cohen phone call, labeled People's Exhibit 246, important? Because it makes it impossible for Trump to say he had no role in hush-money financing.\n\nProsecutors can be expected to argue that this recording directly connects Trump to an illegal campaign conspiracy.\n\nAs they alleged in opening statements, this conspiracy influenced the election by purchasing the silence of McDougal and -- for $130,000 more -- of porn star Daniels. Trump's indictment alleges he falsified 34 business records throughout 2017, his first year in office, to cover up Daniels' hush money.\n\nThe Trump-Cohen phone call shows Trump in the pilot's seat of the conspiracy, prosecutors will argue. Or, at the very least, he's in the cabin with Cohen. Also in the conspiracy cabin: Trump's then-CFO, Allen Weisselberg, and Pecker, the then-National Enquirer publisher, both of whom are name-dropped in the tape.\n\nPeople's 248 is a transcript of this important call, available here. The actual audio can be heard here.\n\nNine times throughout his first year in office, Trump signed checks that are now key exhibits in the hush-money trial. Each was drawn on his personal bank account. Each paid Cohen $35,000 as a \"retainer.\"\n\nAnd each check, prosecutors say, is a felony-level falsified business record. These nine checks are our second smoking gun.\n\nAccording to his indictment, the checks reimbursed Cohen in monthly installments for the $130,000 wired to Daniels just 11 days before the 2016 election, along with some other money Cohen was due.\n\nWhy are these hand-signed checks so important?\n\nTrump can argue that he never saw or handled most of the 34 business records that prosecutors say he \"caused\" to be falsified to hide the Daniels hush money, records that include a year's worth of bogus Cohen \"retainer\" invoices and entries in the Trump Org business ledgers.\n\nBut Trump cannot claim he never saw or handled these nine checks.\n\nAnd that $35,000 amount on each check?\n\nThat amount matches exactly the $35,000 figure that Trump's then-chief financial officer, Weisselberg, landed on when calculating Cohen's monthly reimbursements -- as shown in People's Exhibit 35, described below.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche will likely argue on Tuesday that Trump was too busy running the country to have bothered with the nitty-gritty of falsifying documents. Trump was especially distracted -- even \"multi-tasking\" -- when he signed each of those nine checks, the defense has already suggested.\n\nBut People's 71 -- a January 2017 invoice from the Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, New York -- strongly suggests otherwise. See People's 71 in its entirety here.\n\nWhy is this evidence -- our third smoking gun -- so important?\n\nThe invoice shows Trump personally signing off on the golf club's $6,974.01 annual dues and \"food minimum.\"\n\nIt's proof that Trump continued to pay close attention to his personal spending in 2017.\n\nTrump's former White House executive assistant, Madeleine Westerhout, showed jurors this exhibit when she took the stand earlier this month, delivering a big blow to the \"multi-tasking\" defense.\n\nWesterhout also showed jurors emails revealing that, in June 2017, she got Trump's advance approval for the purchase, with his money, of a $650 Tiffany picture frame. Trump wanted to display a photo of his mother, Westerhout said, on the credenza behind his desk in the Oval Office.\n\nThe frame was 15% off, Trump was told before he approved its purchase.\n\nSo even in the White House, we have Trump signing off on golf fees and picture frames.\n\nThis proven micromanaging makes it easier for prosecutors to argue that Trump was paying attention when he signed $35,000 of his own cash over to Cohen -- who testified that his actual legal work as personal attorney to the president amounted to less than 20 hours in all of 2017.\n\nWe now turn to the most important evidence in the case -- People's 35, our fourth smoking gun.\n\nThis is an October 2016 First Republic bank statement. Both Cohen and Weisselberg scribbled calculations on it.\n\nWhy is this bank statement important?\n\nBecause on just one page, it records Cohen wiring the $130,000 in hush money to Daniels' attorney just 11 days before the 2016 election.\n\nBut there's more: it also shows the Weisselbergian math behind Cohen's $35,000 hush-money reimbursement checks.\n\nAnd the two sets of handwriting -- Cohen's and Weisselberg's -- scrawled across the bottom show the alleged conspiring of Trump's closest lieutenants at the time: his fixer and his top numbers man.\n\nPeople's 35 does not have Trump's fingerprints on it. Jurors have only Cohen's word that Trump saw it. But prosecutors can argue Tuesday that it clinches the case for conspiracy and records-falsification -- subject to connection to Trump himself.\n\nIt will be up to jurors to decide if Trump would have blindly affixed his signature to nine $35,000 checks if he really believed they were \"retainers\" as labeled -- and if he really believed he was paying a lawyer who hardly worked for him anymore.\n\nIt will also be up to jurors to decide if Cohen and Weisselberg would have cooked Trump's books -- hiding the true nature of what Cohen was being paid for -- without the knowledge and approval of Trump, the micromanaging boss footing the bill.\n\nRead Business Insider's deep dive on People's 35 here.\n\nFast forward to 2018. Trump has been in office for a year and, thanks to The Wall Street Journal, the world now knows about his porn-star hush-money scandal.\n\nIn early April, the FBI raided Cohen's office and apartment, seizing evidence it would later use to successfully prosecute him for his illegal $130,000 contribution to his boss's campaign.\n\nThroughout April, Trump worried Cohen would \"flip\" against him, prosecutors argue. So Trump, they say, authorized a communications back channel, whereby Cohen could talk to attorney Robert Costello, who could relay messages to his buddy Rudy Giuliani, then Trump's lawyer.\n\nThis alleged Trump-to-Giuliani-to-Costello-to-Cohen back channel is evident in this prosecution exhibit, People's 205. This is the infamous \"Friends in high places\" email that would be featured in the \"obstruction\" section of the Mueller Report.\n\nWhy is this April 21, 2018 email -- People's Exhibit 205 -- important?\n\nIt suggests the nearly invisible hand of Trump, covertly pulling strings to keep Cohen from cooperating with the justice department and spilling any election conspiracy beans.\n\nIn another email from that same day, People's Exhibit 204, Cohen is assured of Giuliani's gratitude for \"this back channel of communication\" to Trump.\n\nThis email, our gun number 6, again shows the covert, thrice-removed hand of Trump, pulling strings.\n\n\"I just spoke to Rudy Giuliani and told him I was on your team,\" Costello tells Cohen in the email.\n\n\"Rudy was thrilled and said this could not be a better situation for the President or you. He asked me if it was OK to call the President and (then-Trump lawyer) Jay Sekelow and I said fine,\" the email continues.\n\nGiuliani \"asked me to tell you that he knows how tough this is on your family and he will make sue [CQ] to tell the President,\" the email says.\n\nA week later, on May 3, 2018, the hush-money scandal was still in the news, and Trump posted what he may have believed would be a self-exonerating tweet.\n\nWhy is this panicked-sounding, somewhat garbled tweet important?\n\nIt's Trump acknowledging what prosecutors allege in those 34 felony falsification counts: That he knew Cohen's monthly retainer checks were not for legal fees at all.\n\nInstead, they were \"reimbursement\" (Trump's word) for \"a non-disclosure agreement\" (Trump's word again) -- also known as hush money.\n\nTrump tweets this admission just five months after signing his last $35,000 \"retainer\" check to Cohen.\n\nTwelve days later, on May 15, 2018, Trump affixed his black-Sharpie signature to a routine government disclosure form called an \"Executive Branch Personnel Public Financial Disclosure Report.\"\n\nProsecutors call this document People's Exhibit 81. It's the then-president's mandatory disclosure of his assets and liabilities.\n\nUnder \"Liablities\" -- which is the section where Trump must list the money he's borrowed -- Trump certifies that in 2017, he \"fully reimbursed\" Cohen an interest-free sum of between $100,000 and $250,000.\n\nWhy is this footnote on page 45 important? Prosecutors say it reflects Trump's admission that he repaid Cohen's $130,000 hush-money outlay.\n\nIn closing arguments Tuesday, prosecutors may well put People's 81 back on the courtroom display screens.\n\nThey'll scroll past Trump's signature to page 45 and say the footnote proves the then-president knew he was reimbursing Cohen for hush money throughout 2017 -- not paying legal fees as his falsified business records claimed.\n\nOn September 21, 2018, lawyers for Pecker -- then the National Enquirer's publisher -- signed a non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors in Manhattan.\n\nThis is the Department of Justice agreeing not to prosecute the Enquirer's parent company, AMI, for illegal 2016 contributions \"to the campaign of a candidate for President of the United States.\"\n\nIn return, Pecker and AMI's other officers and employees agreed to cooperate in the feds' investigation.\n\nWhy is this non-prosecution agreement -- People's Exhibit 182 -- our ninth smoking gun?\n\nIt shows Pecker admitting to same kind of federal campaign-contribution offense -- in his case, for the $150,000 in hush money that silenced McDougal on Trump's behalf -- that's at the center of the falsification case.\n\nThe jury also knows that Cohen, too, pleaded guilty to this same offense: making an illegally high campaign contribution on Trump's behalf, in his case the $130,000 paid to Daniels.\n\nJurors will be instructed by the judge on Tuesday that they cannot view the AMI agreement and Cohen's guilty plea as proof that Trump, too, violated federal campaign finance law -- but these are tough bells to unring.\n\nRead Business Insider's deep-dive story on how the Federal Election Campaign Act is a central element of Trump's charges.\n\nFinally, here's a smoking micro-gun with some assembly required.\n\nOnce assembled, it bolsters Cohen's testimony that shortly after 12 noon on October 26, 2017, Trump gave his final approval to the hush-money payment.\n\nPeople's 373 is a bank document showing that on that day, First Republic Bank employee Melissa Duran processed Cohen's request for a $131,000 advance on his home-equity loan.\n\nPeople's 374 is an email showing Duran passing this request to her loan servicing department at 12:22 p.m.\n\nPeople's 349 is a call log showing that on that day, Cohen called Trump at 12:26 p.m. and Trump called Cohen at 12:34 p.m. Their two phones were connected for a total of 4 minutes and 29 seconds.\n\nCohen testified that immediately after these calls with Trump, he took the elevator down from his Trump Organization offices at Trump Tower.\n\nThen, he told jurors, he walked across Fifth Avenue to his bank, to finalize the $131,000 transfer out of his home-equity loan, money he'd then wire to Daniels' lawyer the next day.\n\n\"Do you have any doubt in your mind that Mr. Trump gave you the final sign-off to go ahead and make the payment before you went to the bank to complete that?\" prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asked Cohen during redirect examination.\n\n\"No doubt,\" Cohen answered.\n\n\"Would you have paid Stormy Daniels the $130,000 had Mr. Trump not signed off?\"\n\n\"Because I wanted to ensure that I was going to get my funds back,\" Cohen answered.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri":

This includes lawyers, judges, and, most certainly, political commentators.\n\nThis is the mystery of the truth-divination system we call a criminal justice system. We let two white knights (the presumption of innocence clothes both prosecution and defense in white) joust and whoever wins is determined to be representing the side of truth. Juries decide which side wins.\n\nAfter the Trump trial verdict, we will never know exactly what factored into the jury's decision -- whether it be conviction, acquittal or hung jury -- because no one account can capture even how one human mind makes decisions, much less twelve of them.\n\nBut here's what to watch for.\n\nTrump's Cronies Are Prepared if He Loses Hush Money Case\n\nThe prosecution bears the burden of proof and in some jurisdictions that means they go first and last -- meaning the prosecution gets to rebut the defense. However, in New York, the defense goes first and then the prosecution -- no rebuttal. Then judge Juan Merchan will instruct the jury on the law before giving them the case to decide.\n\nThe best defense closings are not scattergun approaches that rely upon lofty rhetoric or anecdotes about the meaning of reasonable doubt. Nor do they talk much about the prosecution bearing the burden of proof and the fact that a defendant is presumed innocent. The reality is defendants tend to face a \"presumed guilty\" attitude that the defense must overcome. To do so, defense counsel needs to present a coherent theory or theories. For example, the defendant wasn't present at the crime scene and the eyewitnesses are suspect because they either have bad eyesight or are biased against the defendant. What the defense should not do is present multiple, conflicting defenses: The defendant was not present at the murder scene, but if they were then it was self-defense.\n\nThus far, Trump's defense team seems to use a throw-everything-at-the-kitchen-wall strategy with a particular emphasis on Trump's favorite foods: insult and shame. The cross-examination of Stormy Daniels tried to discredit her not through inconsistencies in her testimony but by trying to make the jury believe that her acting and directing were shameful pursuits that should preclude anyone from thinking she can tell the truth. It didn't go well for the defense. Daniels came across as genuine and smart and slam-dunked a few times right in the defense counsel's face.\n\nFor Michael Cohen, the defense seemed to have so embraced the media and former Trump attorneys' disparagement of Cohen's honesty that they focused on calling him a liar instead of showing the jury where he might have been wrong or lied.\n\n5 Criticisms of Trump's New York Hush Money Trial That Are Just Wrong\n\nTo salvage their inept case, the defense needs to give a closing which is tightly focused on facts and not their client's penchant for insult. The best way for them to treat the Stormy Daniels testimony is to argue it is not really relevant to whether Trump engaged in falsification of business records since she has no knowledge of accounting details. If, on the other hand, they try to satisfy Trump by arguing that the sexual encounter never took place, then they not only put the jury's focus on a legally irrelevant factor but also risk setting up a credibility contest between Trump and Daniels. That's not a contest Trump is likely to win. With Michael Cohen, they need to play up the slim amount of testimony that Trump gave specific instructions given to falsify the reimbursements to Cohen as legal invoices.\n\nThat leads to the defense's strongest argument, which is that there is insufficient evidence of Trump directing or knowing how the reimbursements were recorded. It's their best argument because it attacks the foundation of the case. The prosecution theory requires the misdemeanor falsification being proven and then proof that the falsification was meant to further another crime: election interference. So without a determination by the jury that Trump knew about the falsification then the prosecution cannot win. Such an approach allows the defense to parry the onslaught of records and testimony -- some by witnesses sympathetic to Trump -- evidencing that the falsification happened and Trump likely knew about it.\n\n'Good-Natured' Trump Trial Lawyer Is Turning Into His Accomplice\n\nIn contrast, the prosecution has an abundance of actual evidence -- versus personal attacks -- to use in its closing, but the evidence must be carefully woven into a simple tale the jury understands. Something along the lines of: Trump tried to cover up his payments to cover up his sexual encounter because he worried the publicity might hurt his election chances. The timeline they walk the jury through needs to be both easy to follow and densely documented by supporting evidence.\n\nStormy Daniels' testimony will be a gift to the prosecution's closing. They can simply reference it as part of the story and let her excellent performance speak to the contrast in credibility between her and the defense arguments as well as the defense witness Robert Costello -- who came across as so arrogant and disrespectful that Judge Juan Merchan had to dress him down after clearing the courtroom.\n\nMichael Cohen should be used by the prosecution as both a guide to and a victim of Trump's world. Cohen weathered his cross-examination well and the prosecution would be smart to reference his testimony without any defensiveness. Certainly any snark thrown at Cohen by the defense can be handled by prosecutors literally pointing to Trump and saying: \"If you don't like Michael Cohen, if you found what he did to be distasteful, then just remember who hired him.\"\n\nThe jury instructions -- which we have not yet seen -- sound like they will be particularly helpful to the prosecution on the element of \"unlawful means.\" Namely, the judge will not require the jury to agree unanimously on which unlawful means were used in the crime. Some jurors may conclude that tax fraud arising from Trump's treatment of the reimbursements as invoices paid to Cohen was the unlawful means for the case while others may conclude that the unlawful means was that the falsification concealed what should have been reported to the Federal Election Commission as an \"in-kind\" campaign contribution.\n\nThis lack of a unanimity requirement is very helpful to the prosecution because the jury can pick and sample as it chooses from evidence of unlawful means without having to agree on only one. This also provides insulation on appeal should there be a conviction.\n\nAs one experienced legal commentator has observed: \"Juries surprise -- sometimes.\" The New York Trump jury is no exception. They may acquit or they may hang. But for me, any outcome other than a conviction will be a surprise given how the prosecution's evidence has been presented, combined with the likelihood that Trump's defense team will likely continue its scattergun tactics in their closing.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

According to Cohen, he paid porn actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 in so-called hush money to keep quiet about an alleged affair with the former president. Cohen claimed that Trump instructed him to execute the settlement agreement with Daniels.\n\n'They haven't even alleged a crime here.'\n\nTrump paid Cohen $35,000 monthly in 2017, a total of $420,000. The checks made out to Cohen, Trump's personal attorney at the time, were marked as legal expenses. However, Cohen claimed that the funds were reimbursements for a number of costs, including the $130,000 settlement payment to Daniels, $50,000 for technology services to RedFinch, and $180,000 for estimated taxes, and a $60,000 bonus.\n\nWill Chamberlain, with the Article III Project, told Blaze News that the New York criminal case against Trump \"never should have been brought,\" explaining that the prosecution's arguments rely \"on the testimony of a convicted felon, admitted perjurer, and disbarred attorney.\"\n\n\"[Cohen's] testimony is the only evidence at all on necessary intent elements of the alleged crime,\" Chamberlain stated. \"No reasonable juror can rely solely on Cohen to prove anything beyond a reasonable doubt, and [Judge Juan] Merchan should have dismissed the case outright.\"\n\nCriminal defense attorney David W. Fischer told Blaze News, \"The prosecution has not established that a criminal offense took place.\"\n\nDuring Cohen's testimony, he admitted that, despite getting reimbursed by the Trump Organization for a payment to RedFinch, he only paid the technology firm $20,000 and pocketed the remaining $30,000. Cohen's reimbursement for the expense also included another $30,000 in estimated taxes. He claimed Trump shortchanged him on his yearly bonus.\n\n\"I was angered because of the reduction in the bonus, and so I just felt it was almost like self-help,\" Cohen admitted to jurors. \"And again $130,000 to have my bonus cut by two-thirds was very upsetting to say the least.\"\n\nChamberlain told Blaze News that Cohen's admission to stealing $60,000 from the Trump Organization undermined his previous testimony that Trump was a micromanager.\n\n\"Even assuming one would be inclined to embezzle, how stupid would you have to be to embezzle from someone you know is a micromanager?\" Chamberlain questioned.\n\nThe defense team maintained that the payments to Cohen were for his legal services as Trump's personal attorney. Cohen claimed he never had a retainer agreement with Trump and did not expect to be paid as the president's lawyer.\n\nWhile on the stand, Cohen admitted to previously lying under oath many times, but he claimed he did so to protect Trump.\n\nFormer federal prosecutor and former Trump attorney Jim Trusty told Blaze News, \"The reality is, there's no corroboration in Cohen's testimony about what Trump knew and what his intentions were.\"\n\n\"In a normal world with a normal jury, this case is a joke. But it's hard to gauge in Manhattan,\" he noted.\n\nRobert Costello, Cohen's former attorney and one of only two witnesses called by the defense, painted Cohen as a self-serving \"inveterate liar,\" according to testimony he provided during a House committee hearing on the Weaponization of the Federal Government.\n\nDuring his time on the stand in the New York criminal trial, Costello claimed that Cohen repeatedly told him in mid-2018 that he did not have any incriminating evidence against Trump and that he made the payment to Daniels without Trump's knowledge. Costello argued that Cohen was desperate to win favor with Trump and secure a spot on his presidential Cabinet.\n\n\"Michael Cohen said numerous times that President Trump knew nothing about those payments, that he did this on his own. He repeated that numerous times,\" Costello testified.\n\nDuring his first day on the stand, Costello clashed with the judge overseeing the case, acting Justice Juan Merchan, Blaze News previously reported. The attorney rolled his eyes, audibly sighed, and remarked, \"Ridiculous,\" when the judge ruled to sustain multiple objections from the prosecution during his testimony. Costello's frustration prompted the Merchan to briefly clear the courtroom.\n\nFormer Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo told Blaze News that Trump's legal team has \"done a good job,\" noting that they \"successfully destroyed\" Cohen's credibility with Costello.\n\n\"They have made clear to all that the prosecution has failed to show that the bookkeeping misdemeanor actually advanced some greater felony. That greater felony has barely been mentioned, not to mention proved, at trial,\" Yoo explained.\n\nTrusty told Blaze News, \"We're at the end of the trial, and we're waiting with bated breath to hear what the theory of felonization is. That is unlike any trial I could ever think of that you go through the entire trial and it's still an open question of how this is a felony case.\"\n\nSo far, throughout the trial, Merchan has appeared to disproportionately side with Bragg's team, which has some legal experts questioning how the judge will choose to instruct the jury regarding the charges.\n\n'That's an area where the judge's instructions could make a huge difference.'\n\nMerchan previously placed a gag order against Trump, prohibiting him from speaking about anyone involved in the case or their relatives. His supporters have sounded the alarm, claiming that the order was, in part, intended to stop Trump from publicly discussing Merchan's daughter, who works for a progressive political consulting firm. The defense made multiple unsuccessful attempts to get Merchan booted from the case over the alleged \"actual conflict\" and \"unacceptable appearance of impropriety.\"\n\nAdditionally, the gag order prevents Trump from discussing Matthew Colangelo, a former top-ranking Department of Justice official who effectively took a demotion to join Bragg's prosecution team in the case against the former president. In 2018, Colangelo received $12,000 from the Democratic National Committee for \"political consulting,\" Blaze News previously reported.\n\nIn a recent letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) stated that Colangelo working as a New York prosecutor for Bragg has \"given the perception that the Justice Department is assisting in\" the \"politicized prosecution\" of Trump.\n\nThe restrictive gag order has also inhibited Trump from defending himself from political attacks from witnesses amid his 2024 presidential run. Cohen has repeatedly used his podcast and TikTok account to attack Trump's character and his campaign. At one point during the trial, after several failed attempts to get the gag order removed, the defense proposed placing a similar order against Cohen, but Merchan refused the request. Instead, the judge elected to tell the prosecution to remind Cohen that he should not speak about the trial publicly.\n\nThe prosecution and the defense are expected to give closing arguments this week. After the defense rested its case on Tuesday, the lawyers discussed the parameters of the jury instruction, arguably one of the most vital stages of the trial.\n\n\"The jury instructions may tilt the field against the defense, the last thing the judge could do to favor the prosecution,\" Yoo told Blaze News.\n\nDespite not being charged with any election interference-related crimes, the prosecution has argued that the alleged falsified business records amounted to Trump attempting to illegally sway the 2016 election.\n\nTrusty described two focal points for the judge's jury instruction.\n\n\"The first is, how does [the judge] instruct on the government's proof of Trump's knowledge of the false entries?\" he said.\n\n\"There's a big difference between a judge saying that the government must prove that the entries were false and that President Trump knew, or should have known, about them,\" Trusty told Blaze News. \"The other way you could say it is, the government has to prove that these entries that were made were false and that President Trump, beyond a reasonable doubt, was complicit in making these entries.\"\n\nHe noted that the jury may decide not to proceed if it determines that the prosecution failed to prove that Trump knew what was being entered on the checks and ledgers.\n\nTrusty continued, \"That's an area where the judge's instructions could make a huge difference. The other area is the felony part,\" which claims that the false entries were done in furtherance of another crime.\n\n\"If the judge instructs that political motivation need only be one part of the overall motivation for false entries, well, that's a no-brainer,\" Trusty explained. \"Even if [Trump] was primarily focused on Melania, or keeping it quiet just for his general reputation, it's not hard to convince a jury that at least some tiny part of it related to the presidential election. But if he says it has to be entirely motivated by politics, by political viability, then that's a much higher burden for the government because being afraid of your wife finding out could be a full defense.\"\n\nChamberlain told Blaze News that the most significant obstacles for the defense in this case \"are the bias of the judge and the potential bias of the jury.\"\n\n\"Manhattan is a very blue area, and they have to worry that the jury will look to convict Trump regardless of what the evidence supports,\" he said.\n\nChamberlain argued that the prosecution has \"failed\" to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\"The defense's best strategy is to try and make this case about the law and the facts and to point out how not credible Michael Cohen is,\" he added.\n\nYoo explained that the defense \"still has to fight not just a politically biased prosecutor but a judge who clearly looks poorly upon the defense.\"\n\nCriminal defense attorney Fischer told Blaze News that he believes there is a more straightforward argument for dismissing the case.\n\n\"The statute makes it a crime. It deals with the falsification of business records,\" Fischer said. \"To falsify a record means to take an existing record and change it in a way that changes the character of the record.\"\n\n\"It is not the addition of a false record into a business. If you carefully go through the indictment ... the most important words to read are the words 'to wit,' which means, essentially, the grand jury specifically charges as follows,\" he remarked.\n\nBragg's first count against Trump states, \"The defendant ... on or about February 14, 2017, with intent to defraud and intent to commit another crime and aid and conceal the commission thereof, made and caused a false entry in the business records of an enterprise, to wit, an invoice from Michael Cohen dated February 14, 2017, marked as a record of the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, and kept and maintained by the Trump Organization.\"\n\nFischer explained that because the term \"to wit\" is used, the prosecution must prove the \"elements of the crime\" as well as the specific set of facts alleged by the grand jury.\n\n\"When the grand jury specifically specifies a particular way that the crime was committed, the prosecutors stuck with that allegation,\" he told Blaze News. Fischer added that a case can be overturned if the judge provides jury instruction that does not align with the exact allegations made by the grand jury.\n\n\"So what is the false entry that Trump allegedly made in the business records? The false entry is, 'to wit, an invoice from Michael Cohen.' What they've alleged is that Michael Cohen sending an invoice from his law firm to the Trump Organization is a false entry in the business records. Well, that's not a crime,\" Fischer continued. \"That is not an entry in the business records of the Trump Organization. It's basically somebody sending their invoice.\"\n\nRegarding the false entry counts, Fischer believes the prosecution \"clearly ha[s] not met their burden.\"\n\n\"They haven't even alleged a crime here,\" he added.\n\nFischer noted the seventh count against Trump, which states that there was a \"false entry in the business records of an enterprise, to wit, a Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust Account check and check stub.\"\n\n\"In the light most favorable to Alvin Bragg, which is how the court would look at it, how is writing a check on a trust account -- how is that making a false entry in the Trump Organization records? It's not,\" he told Blaze News, adding that Trump's trust is not part of the company.\n\nFischer stated that \"there are multiple other arguments\" the defense could make, including contending that the prosecution has failed to prove that Trump had anything to do with marking the payments to Cohen as legal expenses.\n\n\"I don't think they have proof that Trump ordered, 'Hey, write this in the books a certain way.' I mean, what if it had been written in as miscellaneous expenses?\" Fischer continued. \"I don't believe it was an entry, first of all. But even if it was an entry, it has to be objectively false.\"", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He is accused of falsifying internal Trump Organisation records as part of a scheme to bury damaging stories that he feared could hurt his 2016 campaign, particularly as Trump's reputation was suffering at the time from comments he had made about women.\n\nWith the US more politically divided than it's been since the Civil War, many are worried a conviction of Trump could just cause more problems. Speaking to the Mirror, Gregory Germain, Professor of Law at Syracuse University, explained where the trial could go and the problems it could cause.\n\nREAD MORE: Donald Trump rants about prosecution's 'big advantage' in closing arguments\n\nHe said: \"I doubt that there are any Trump supporters on the jury, and I think they are likely very offended by Trump's conduct in and out of court, and with the unethical behaviour. So, even though only one juror is necessary for Trump to obtain a mistrial, and even though it's a very flawed case, I predict that the jury will convict him.\n\n\"Because it would be so outrageous to sentence Trump to jail for a first-time non-violent Class E felony, and doing so would cause a constitutional crisis and betray the judge's bias, I think the judge will sentence him to probation.\"\n\nHe added: \"Ultimately, I think the verdict will be reversed on appeal. If the judge sentences Trump to prison, then the courts will intervene quickly. If Trump isn't sentenced to prison, the appeal will take its sweet time and be reversed after the election.\"\n\nThe allegations against Trump focus on payoffs to two women, porn actor Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, who said they had extramarital sexual encounters with Trump years earlier, as well as to a Trump Tower doorman who claimed to have a story about a child he alleged Trump had out of wedlock. Trump says none of these supposed sexual encounters occurred.\n\nProfessor Germain expressed worry about the legal pursuit of Trump in this way. He said: \"I have been very critical of the DA for bringing such a flawed case, and of the judge for pushing the case forward in such a confusing way, given all of the legal problems with the claims in the indictment. I don't think the DA proved that Trump committed fraud and a separate crime by facilitating the recording of the business records to show attorney fees rather than reimbursing hush money payments.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I think the DA and the Judge are fully invested in obtaining a conviction. I think the judge will gloss over the legal issues in the jury instructions to allow a conviction by defining the legal issue around the propriety of paying hush money rather than the legality of paying hush money and how that relates to the document's charges.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlie_jones@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Charlie Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_probation_and_supervised_release", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States federal probation and supervised release"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Syracuse University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonviolence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karen McDougal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trump Tower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_instructions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury instructions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32907195.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_trumpexcl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.6392156862745098, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

At closing arguments starting Tuesday morning, Trump's defense team (likely lead counsel Todd Blanche) will go first and make its final bid to the jury. They will be followed by the People, led by their most experienced prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass (as was stated during the opening statement). Then at the end of the day Tuesday or more likely Wednesday morning, Merchan will charge the jury with reaching a verdict according to legal instructions he will provide.\n\nWhile the jury instructions have not yet been publicly issued by the judge, the broad parameters are now sufficiently set due to the \"charging conference\" at which these issues were discussed, the proposed jury instructions submitted by both sides which were released Friday night, and standard jury instructions in New York courts. On that basis, we can analyze the likely defense and prosecution closings. In this article we do that, providing the most extensive publicly available forecast of what to expect, with detailed references to the trial transcripts identifying the relevant evidence for both sides.\n\nThe DA's office charged Trump with 34 counts of violating New York Penal Law \u00a7 175.10 (Falsifying Business Records in the first degree). For each count, per New York's standard jury instructions, the elements that must be proven are:\n\n(1) On or about the date in question, Trump made or caused a false entry in the business records of an enterprise; and\n\n(2) Trump did so with intent to defraud that\n\n(3) included an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof.\n\nThe intent elements are complex. The jury must determine not only that Trump had an intent to defraud, but also that this intent included an intent to commit another crime, or to aid or conceal the commission of another crime. The DA of course needs to meet the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, so the defense will underscore that the jury need only find a morsel of doubt to acquit. The People will argue they have eliminated any such scintilla.\n\nWe turn now to what the experienced attorneys will likely each argue based upon the openings, what they have said in court since, the evidence, and the law -- and on our observations in both of us attending court daily.\n\n1. General Attacks on the DA's Theory of the Case\n\nThe defense will need to present its arguments as to each of the legal elements of the jury instructions. But first, our observation of the defense team across 20 days of trial has led us to expect they will attack the credibility of key evidence.\n\nThe defense will argue that all of the events that the witnesses recounted occurred long ago, echoing the very beginning of the opening of their case: \"most of what you are going to hear about in this trial, most of the conversations, most of the documents are from 2015, 2016, 2017, years and years ago, pre-COVID\" (4/22 Transcript at 889).\n\nThe defense will likely center their attack on Michael Cohen, whom some have termed the prosecution's star witness. The defense will describe how believing Cohen is necessary to find Trump guilty, and Cohen's testimony is not credible at all. (Note that the parties here have agreed that if the jury \"find[s] that any witness has intentionally testified falsely to any material fact, you may disregard that witness's entire testimony. Or you may disregard so much of it as you find was untruthful.\") Nothing about Trump's intent at the key moments of the alleged document falsification and alleged underlying crimes is corroborated without Cohen, they will claim. There is no written or recorded evidence of any of what Cohen claims he said to Trump and what Trump said to him regarding the Stormy Daniels payment itself and its alleged documentary coverup. True, there is supporting and corroborating evidence such as call logs with timestamps of communications between Cohen and Trump, but the defense will note that the content of the conversations themselves rely on Cohen's word (5/20 Transcript at 4290).\n\nThe defense will especially hammer Cohen's recollection of his Oct. 24, 2016 call -- the part of the cross that garnered the most media attention. Although we were present in the courtroom and thought that the jury's reaction was not as extreme as that of some commentators, it was a major moment. As Blanche has said to the court, Cohen had \"testified on direct about a phone call [during which] he remembers specifically a key part of this crime that took place\" in that approximately 90-second call (5/20 Transcript at 4282). The defense will reiterate that the call was really about the 14 year-old who was pranking Cohen, as the text messages between Cohen and Schiller definitively show. They will contend that Cohen lied or was willing to say things he did not really know when he said on direct that the call was about the Daniels payment and was caught when confronted with the full record about the 8:02 PM conversation on Oct. 24. They will point to the words he used during that dramatic confrontation as proof that he waffled because he was making it up, such as that the Daniels \"could\" have been discussed or that he \"believes\" it was or \"there was more than potentially just this\" or \"I am not certain that is accurate\" in response to Blanche saying he did not speak to Trump that night (5/16 Transcript at 3894, 3895). The bottom line, the defense will claim, is that they proved that the purpose and content of the call was about another topic with Trump's bodyguard Keith Schiller and that Cohen made false statements about that in his testimony, after being put up to it by the prosecution.\n\nThe defense can bolster that line by attacking Cohen's motives and character. First, they will assert that Cohen was out for revenge against Trump for whatever specific reason, including wanting to be White House Chief of Staff and feeling grievously wounded when he was not even considered for the role (5/16 Transcript at 3855). Further, he lied many times over and, the defense will argue, is a shady cheat who stole from Trump, pointing to his admission that he saw reimbursement for a much larger amount than he actually paid to a vendor, RedFinch, stealing $60,000 there as part of the total $420,000 he obtained from Trump in 2017.\n\nFurthermore, they will add, his record of seeking financial advantage through the former president has not ended. They will argue Cohen is now profiting off of criticizing Trump. \"Apart from his work for President Trump and the Trump companies, he cheated on his taxes, he lied to banks, he lied about side businesses he had with taxi medallions\" (Blanche: 4/22 Transcript at 900). Cohen lied under oath to Congress, and he said he would be willing to lie out of loyalty, so surely he likely did the same to this jury (5/16 Transcript at 3792).\n\nDuring its cross-examination, the defense also invoked the millions of dollars Cohen made on two books, a potential TV deal, more than 200 episodes of weekly podcasts, and daily TikToks. We can expect to hear about that again on closing. For example, Blanche asked Cohen, \"Do you have a financial interest in the outcome of this case?\" To which Cohen answered, \"Yes, sir\" (5/20 Transcript at 4123). Justice Merchan did not allow Blanche, in the defense's opening statement, to bring in Cohen's testimony that he lied under oath to the now-late U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III in pleading guilty to crimes he now says he did not commit. But the judge cautioned that Blanche could use it in summations if it was properly brought in during the course of the trial (4/22 Transcript at 904). Blanche and Cohen had a tug-of-war over the false testimony to the federal judge (5/16 Transcript at 3804), so it is likely Blanche tries to press his advantage during closing.\n\nThe defense will then discuss its own case, which almost exclusively focused on Cohen's role and legitimacy. In the defense's view, Cohen is the lynchpin for the entirety of the DA's case, and without him it all unravels. First, they called Blanche's paralegal to establish that Cohen had dozens of phone calls with Robert Costello, the lawyer who attempted to represent Cohen in the aftermath of the FBI raid on Cohen's office and residence. Though Merchan said that Costello was not permitted to speak to Cohen's state of mind, he did allow Costello to potentially impeach Cohen through testimony about Cohen's prior inconsistent statements (5/20 Transcript at 4225). Costello reported that Cohen said \"quote: 'I swear to God, Bob. I don't have anything on Donald Trump'\" (5/20 Transcript at 4231).\n\nIn its last broadside on the prosecution's evidence, the defense will say that other non-Trump Organization witnesses, not only Cohen, were biased against Trump. Especially Stormy Daniels. \"[S]ince this story came out in 2018, became public, she's made hundreds of thousands of dollars because of it. She also wrote a book. She was paid for a documentary\" (4/22 Transcript at 906).\n\n2. False Entries\n\nThe defense will also likely go point by point rebutting the DA's characterization of the legal elements for felony falsification of business records. They will address the first element by contending that all the business filings were accurate and not false and, even supposing they were false, that Trump was not the cause of their entry.\n\nThe money that Trump paid Cohen in 2017 was for legal services Cohen rendered to Trump and the Trump family, not as part of a reimbursement scheme. \"There is no dispute that Mr. Cohen provided legal services to President Trump in 2017. Not only did Mr. Cohen admit that, but Miss Tarasoff when she booked the records that are part of at least 12 of the counts said the same thing\" (Blanche: 5/20 Transcript at 4275). If Trump is such a frugal penny pincher, why would he pay Michael Cohen $420,000 for a $130,000 hush payment? (4/22 Transcript at 892). During Cohen's cross-examination, Blanche established that Cohen was paid a similar amount, $425,000, the previous year in 2015, including his bonus that year. At a minimum, the defense will argue, Trump thought the payments were for legal services being billed by his personal attorney.\n\nThough it was all above board, the defense will argue, even assuming any of the alleged activity was a false entry, Trump was not the cause. This was all business as usual done by Trump Organization employees - the accountants, Allen Weisselberg, and Cohen. \"President Trump had nothing to do, had nothing to do with the invoice, with the check being generated, or with the entry on the ledger\" (4/22 Transcript at 894). They will say that Michael Cohen himself corroborated this version of events to Costello: \"Michael Cohen said, numerous times, that President Trump knew nothing about those payments [to Stormy Daniels], that he [Cohen] did this on his own\" (5/20 Transcript at 4235). While they did not seek a jury instruction on the implications of a missing prosecution witness, expect the defense to criticize the People for not calling Weisselberg and to argue the failure to do so leaves a hole in proving the case.\n\n3. Intent to Defraud\n\nFor the first portion of the intent element, the defense will contend that all the records at issue were overt and above board, signifying transparency and devoid of any intent to defraud.\n\nIn the motion for a judgment of acquittal hearing, Blanche highlighted how \"the invoices are going to The Trump Organization, a check is being generated for him to sign in the White House, for the President to sign in the White House, and then - which he does, which he signs in the White House\" (5/20 Transcript at 4276-7). This is simply a case of Michael Cohen billing the Trump Organization for his legal fees as the president's personal attorney, going through all of the proper and usual channels, they will say. Trump only had to sign the checks because he was the sole signatory on his account. If there had been any intent to defraud, there would not be such a standardized, business-as-usual paper trail.\n\nThe defense will also attack the DA's position that the object of Trump's intent to defraud was the voting public. They will argue instead that \"a person acts with intent to defraud, when his or her conscious objective or purpose is to lead another into error or disadvantage,\" such that an individual has to be the target of an intent to defraud (5/22 Transcript at 4386), and there is none.\n\n4. Intent to Aid, Commit or Conceal Another Crime\n\nThe defense will point to a myriad of possible motivations Trump had for arranging the nondisclosure agreement and the hush money payment. None of them was a motivation to help his campaign, they'll say, or at least there's reasonable doubt as to that being his motivation. Even if he did intend to help his campaign, it was not a conspiracy but rather a commonplace arrangement that politicians have among friends and allies.\n\nFirst, Trump intended to protect his family, not the campaign. In Blanche's opening statement, he emphasized that Trump is \"a husband... a father\" (4/22 Transcript at 889). \"Trump fought back, like he always does and like he's entitled to do, to protect his family, his reputation and his brand\" (4/22 Transcript at 897).\n\nAlternatively, this was a legal NDA. Given that Trump did not enter false records and had no intent to defraud, it is perfectly fine that part of his intent was to influence the election: \"I have a spoiler alert. There is nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It's called democracy\" (4/22 Transcript at 896). It was permissible for Trump to have this motive, since there was no conspiracy, just an understanding among friends and business associates. As Blanche highlighted, \"There's nothing illegal about a scheme. There's nothing illegal about what you will hear happened among AMI and National Enquirer and Mr. Pecker and President Trump. It happens - I expect you will hear shortly, this sort of thing happens regularly, that newspapers make decisions about what to publish, when to publish, and how to publish. It happens with politicians, with wealthy people, with famous people\" (4/22 Transcript at 907).\n\nEven if Trump intended to benefit his own campaign, the defense will challenge that he did not do so using the \"unlawful means\" required by the main predicate offense upon which the DA seems to be relying, N.Y. Elec. Law \u00a7 17-152: Conspiracy to promote or prevent election. Under that statute, \"Any two or more persons who conspire to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means and which conspiracy is acted upon by one or more of the parties thereto, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\"\n\nBut as the defense has stated, \"There has to be something illegal about the efforts by the co-conspirators to influence the election. And what the evidence shows is that they all got together in 2015 and agreed that they would talk about positive and negative stories, and that there would be positive stories pushed and negative stories pushed\" (5/20 Transcript at 4278). The defense team characterized the three payoff incidents that followed as \"not a catch and kill, your Honor, certainly not a criminal catch and kill\" (5/20 Transcript at 4281).\n\nThey can also attack the formation of a conspiracy because, crucially, one of the alleged co-conspirators did not even want to participate. \"As it relates to Ms. Daniels, AMI wanted nothing to do with that. There's lots of testimony about that\" (5/20 Transcript at 4281). Each of the meetings that allegedly shows conspiratorial intent either was a normal conversation, or the jury has to rely on Cohen's false testimony, or David Pecker didn't even want to be involved.\n\nLastly, the defense will highlight how its witnesses rebutted the idea that there was a coordinated pressure campaign against Cohen to fall in line with a conspiracy or scheme. The defense first called Blanche's paralegal, Daniel Sitko, to lay the foundation of call logs between Cohen and Costello. The two men spoke many times at length, and the defense asked, \"Mr. Costello, did you ever put any pressure on Michael Cohen to do anything?\" Costello answered, \"No.\" \"Did you ever pressure him to interact with Rudy Giuliani in a certain way?\" \"Not at all.\" (5/20 Transcript at 4255). And when the defense asked Costello, \"Did you care about President Trump's interest while you were dealing with Michael Cohen?\" Costello testified, \"No. My obligation was to Michael Cohen\" (5/20 Transcript at 4256).\n\n5. Defending against other predicate crimes (FECA and state tax violations)\n\nThe DA continues to discuss other possible predicate crimes that Trump intended to commit and that enhance the charges to felonies: the Federal Election Campaign Act and state tax violations. It appears that they will argue these principally as \"unlawful means\" with respect to the alleged \u00a7 17-152 conspiracy, with that statute as the sole or at least lead predicate for the falsifying business records violation. The alternative, previously used by the DA both in the charging documents and in the briefing on the motion to dismiss is to argue FECA and tax violations as both unlawful means under the \u00a7 17-152 predicate and separately as independent predicates for falsifying business records under \u00a7 175.10.\n\nIn any event, the defense will attempt to counteract both. FECA occupied a far greater proportion of attention during trial and at the charging conference, and both sides have submitted detailed jury instructions on point. The defense had wished to call former FEC Commissioner Brad Smith to explicate certain portions of FECA, but only the judge can instruct the jury on the law in a criminal matter. Since his testimony would have been restricted, the defense chose not to call him.\n\nOne critical detail of the defense strategy as to FECA appears in their proposed jury instructions and has yet to be resolved. For instance, the defense insisted that the conspiracy would have to undertake a criminal violation of FECA, not a civil one, in order to meet the requirements of 175.10. (5/22 Transcript at 4346). And the defense requested the word \"willfully\" be used to instruct the jury on the level of intent the People must show for Trump's violations of FECA. (5/22 Transcript at 4345). A willful violation would require the potential violator to act with \"knowledge that [one's] conduct was unlawful.\" Should they obtain this instruction, the defense will likely argue that Trump in 2016 had no idea any of this conduct violated FECA and no evidence was introduced on that point. (5/22 Transcript at 4355).\n\nWhether or not they prevail on a \"wilfully\" instruction, expect the defense to rely on the argument that non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) are perfectly legal; indeed, Cohen admitted as much on cross. And as a backstop, look for them to point to the evidence in the record that Trump did this to spare himself and his family embarrassment. They will likely combine that argument with the contention that if the jury disbelieves Cohen, as it must, the prosecution has not met its extremely high burden to establish proof beyond the reasonable doubt that Trump intended to benefit his campaign.\n\nAs for the tax offense, here the prosecution has conceded that willfulness must be established. (5/22 Transcript at 4347). Like with FECA, the defense will likely argue that there's no evidence in the record of Trump being aware of the tax statute and intending to violate it. Here, they have a bit of a tougher row to hoe because of the smoking gun document detailing the \"grossed up\" reimbursement that Cohen testified he and Weisselberg reviewed with Trump in early January 2017. Nevertheless, they are likely to point to Cohen's testimony suggesting that he was not focused on the tax treatment and simply wanted to be repaid to once again argue that the prosecution simply has not met its burden.\n\nWe now turn to how the People will counter these and the many other arguments that we have anticipated the defense will make, as well as how prosecutors will put their own best foot forward.\n\nThe prosecution closes after the defense. Expect ADA Steinglass, if as we anticipate he is tapped with the closing, to remind the jury of the evidence at a granular level, detailing witness testimony and exhibits, and arguing common sense inferences that the jury should draw from the evidence.\n\nWe expect the People's closing to center on three main disputed issues in terms of proving the elements of the crimes: (1) Were the records false? (2) Did Trump make the false entries -- or cause them to be made? And (3) Did Trump have the required intent to defraud, including the intent to commit or conceal either a campaign finance or election violation or a tax one. And just as the defense will seek to tear Cohen down, the prosecution will attempt to bolster him, arguing his testimony was credible and is heavily supported and corroborated.\n\n1. The Records Were False\n\nWhether the records in question -- the 34 total invoices, checks, and ledger entries -- were false is a straightforward question: was the $420,000 paid to Cohen reimbursement, or payment for his legal services? The evidence is straightforward, too. Former Trump controller Jeffrey McConney and Cohen each testified how the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels became $420,000 owed to Cohen. The jury saw handwritten notes from former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg and Cohen (the crucial Exhibit 35) made in January 2017 and handwritten notes from McConney (Exhibit 36) also from January 2017, calculating a payment to Cohen totaling $420,000. Weisselberg noted his calculations on an October 2016 bank statement for Essential Consultants -- Cohen's shell LLC -- including a line item for the $130,000. And although McConney testified that he did not know the $130,000 line item corresponded to the Daniels payment, he was clear that the payment was to reimburse Cohen for money already owed, not for ongoing legal expenses. McConney testified that, \"Allen said we had to get some money to Michael, reimburse Michael... he had a complaint about his prior year bonus, so he wanted to get paid for that. And then there was some other money he was owed\" (5/6 Transcript at 2290-1). (Unlike Cohen, McConney did not testify that he was aware of the underlying purpose of the hush money repayment, just that it was to repay Cohen for a payment to Keith Davidson (5/6 Transcript at 2299.))\n\nMcConney also testified how he sent the invoices to Deborah Tarasoff, who handled accounts payable, to cut the monthly checks. Jurors saw the checks, invoices, and ledger entries, each purporting to be connected to Cohen's legal expenses, including that the money was paid from the Trump Organization's legal expenses account -- the \"51505\" account (5/6 Transcript at 2319). But as the jury knows, the money was not for legal services.\n\nThe defense has argued that the records were accurate because Cohen was in fact being paid for legal services, but there is no evidence to support that claim. The prosecution can counter that it makes little sense to call hush money reimbursement \"legal services.\" There was no legal retainer agreement, and there was no ongoing legal work for which Cohen was actually being paid. Cohen testified he did some separate and minimal legal work gratuitously. (Prosecutors asked, \"How would you characterize the amount of work that you did generally on that matter, if any?\" Cohen: \"Very minimal.\" \"Did you ever bill Mr. Trump or The Trump Organization for that minimal work that you said that you did on that?\" \"No, ma'am.\" (5/14 Transcript at 3542-3)). A February 14, 2017 email exchange between Cohen and McConney discussing the first two monthly payments shows Cohen did not remember the amount he was to be paid; McConney had to remind him it was $35,000 per month (5/6 Transcript at 2315). This is further evidence that the repayment was not for services Cohen had rendered or pursuant to a retainer agreement, where in either situation Cohen would have known how much to invoice. The same day Cohen sent a false invoice to Weisselberg claiming the two monthly $35,000 payments were pursuant to a retainer agreement (5/6 Transcript at 2315), and both sides agree Cohen never had a retainer agreement.\n\nIn his opening, defense attorney Todd Blanche said Tarasoff was told by another accountant - \"someone who has nothing to do with this\" -- to call it a legal expense, and she did (4/22 Transcript at 893). That Tarasoff and other administrators who \"had nothing to do with this\" believed the money to be legal expenses helps prove the prosecution's point: that the people who actually knew -- Weisselberg, Cohen, McConney, and Trump -- prove the records were false.\n\nThe prosecution has such a strong claim that these payments were reimbursements that we expect them to make a big point that Blanche had promised the jurors the opposite in the defense's opening statement. Blanche had told the jury, \"More significantly than that, ladies and gentlemen, you're going to learn that this was not a payback. The $35,000 a month was not a payback to Mr. Cohen for the money that he gave to Ms. Daniels\" (4/22 Transcript at 892). The prosecution can remind jurors that Trump himself made statements over Twitter acknowledging it was a \"reimbursement\" and admitted the same in court filings in civil litigation against Stormy Daniels and in a federal government ethics filing.\n\n2. Trump Is Responsible For The False Entries\n\nThe prosecution will surely concede that Trump was not the one submitting the invoices, cutting the checks (although he did sign them), or making the ledger entries. But they will argue that Trump was responsible for the false records; he \"caused\" them to be made, as the statutory element requires.\n\nWhile the catch-and-kill scheme was hatched in August 2015, the falsification of the 34 records at issue did not begin until after the 2016 election. In December 2016, Cohen testified, he \"actually had to take a double take and then immediately went to Mr. Weisselberg's office in the back and in some very colorful language expressed to him how truly pissed off and angry I really was\" about his bonus being cut by two-thirds (5/13 Transcript at 3476). Then in January 2017, he went to Weisselberg again to discuss repayment for the $130,000, and Weisselberg agreed (5/13 Transcript at 3485). The two men then went to Trump's office with Weisselberg's calculations, and the three agreed to the repayment. Prosecutors asked, \"What, if anything, did Mr. Trump say at that time?\" To which Cohen answered, \"He approved it. And he also said: 'This is going to be one heck of a ride in D.C.'\" (5/13 Transcript at 3492). Then on February 8, 2017, Cohen met with Trump in the White House to confirm the repayment. Cohen testified in detail about sitting in the Oval Office, where Trump told Cohen to deal with \"Allen\" (Weisselberg) and that a check would be coming for January and February (5/14 Transcript at 3513). Several pieces of evidence corroborate Cohen's visit: a photo of Cohen and Trump outside the Oval Office, Cohen's electronic calendar reflecting the \"Meeting with POTUS,\" and testimony from Madeleine Westerhout, who served as the presidential executive assistant, sitting outside the Oval Office and sent Cohen an email saying, \"Michael. We're confirmed for 4:30 on Wednesday\" (5/9 Transcript at 3006). The following week, the February 14 email exchange between Cohen and McConney discusses the repayment, and the first check was dated the same day.\n\nThe jury also heard a recorded call between Cohen and Trump from September 2016 in the context of the payment to McDougal discussing the need for Cohen to open up a shell company and that he talked about the arrangement with Weisselberg. It's indisputable that Cohen and Trump discussed opening a company in connection with money being transferred for a transaction involving David Pecker, and that Trump took an active role in requesting more detailed information about \"financing\" that payment (5/13 Transcript at 3339). Although this conversation is not directly connected to any of the 34 false records underlying the counts, it reinforces Cohen's testimony about the two conversations he had with Trump in January and February 2017 regarding reimbursement for the Daniels payment. It stands to reason, the prosecutors will say, that Weisselberg and Cohen surely kept Trump informed of the Daniels payment as well. Why would they, including the ultra loyal Weisselberg, possibly hide it from him? What's more, the prosecutors can show Trump was in the loop on the Daniels payment and reimbursement scheme, as David Pecker testified that Cohen specifically asked Pecker in November/December to entreat Trump to pay Cohen back for it. And Hope Hicks confirmed that it would not be consistent with Cohen's character to make the $130,000 payment from his own money never to be reimbursed.\n\nTrump's own statements -- in multiple sworn documents and tweets -- confirm he personally knew the payments to Cohen were reimbursements. Trump signed and certified a government ethics form (PX 81), which describes in a footnote in general terms the reimbursement. He made public statements acknowledging the reimbursement (PX 407G) and did so in the context of the civil suit against Daniels, as mentioned above.\n\nExpect the DA to argue that Trump's micromanagement of expenses confirms his knowledge of the reimbursement and tax scheme. Tarasoff, who still works for the Trump Organization and had a favorable impression of Trump, explained how Trump insisted on signing checks personally and would sometimes refuse to sign them even when approved by Weisselberg. Westerhout, who worked just outside the Oval Office, testified how Trump paid attention to details. She also described how especially in the first months of the administration in early 2017 Trump was still doing a lot of work with the Trump Organization. Additionally, the jury was provided excerpts from Trump: Think Like a Billionaire which, in a chapter titled \"How To Pinch Pennies,\" contained Trump saying, \"I received a check for fifty cents, and we at The Trump Organization deposited it. They may call that cheap; I call it watching the bottom line.... As I said before, I always sign my checks, so I know where my money's going. In the same spirit, I also always try to read my bills to make sure I'm not being overcharged\" (5/7 Transcript at 2527).\n\n3. Trump's Intent Was Fraudulent\n\nProving intent will be the most difficult issue for the prosecution. First, proving what was in someone's mind is almost always more difficult than proving what he did. And second, in this case the jury instructions may be confusing because there are two layers of intent: the intent to defraud by falsifying the records, and whether that intent included an intent to commit or conceal another crime. (A further complication is that it is as yet unclear exactly how the judge will instruct the jury on this intent, and whether the instructions will make clear that the intent to commit or conceal another crime by itself sufficiently establishes the required level of intent for the falsification of records.)\n\nThe prosecutors will likely try to simplify the intent required by translating the jury instructions from legalese to common sense. As the instruction for falsifying business records provides, \"intent means conscious objective or purpose.\" Fraudulent means with deception or dishonesty. And there is no requirement that Trump know what laws he was breaking or even whether he was breaking any laws. Ignorance of the law is no excuse in New York. Rather, prosecutors need only show he consciously and purposefully undertook the actions that in turn violated the statute.\n\nTrump didn't memorialize his fraudulent intent; he didn't write down he knew what he was doing was wrong. Neither Cohen nor Pecker nor any other witness testified they had conversations where they openly and expressly discussed with Trump that what they were doing was illegal. But expect prosecutors to argue that common sense tells us that is not how people operate. Just as common sense tells us that we can discern Trump's intent from his actions: what he did shows why he did it. And why he did it was obvious: to hide potentially damaging information about his affair with Daniels from voters because he was worried it would cost him the election.\n\nThe evidence of Trump's intent begins with the August 2015 Trump Tower meeting where Pecker, Cohen and Trump conceived the catch and kill scheme-with the singular focus of helping Trump win the election. Pecker described a \"mutually beneficial\" arrangement where he would be the eyes and ears of the campaign to kill negative stories about Trump, write positive ones, and publish negative stories about his political opponents (4/23 Transcript at 1017). He testified that after the Trump Tower meeting he returned to his office and told the Editor-in-Chief of the Enquirer, Dylan Howard, that \"that we were going to try to help the campaign, and to do that, I want to keep this as quiet as possible\" (4/23 Transcript at 1020). He explained how, pursuant to their agreement, he would have held publishing the story from doorman Dino Sajudin until after the election (4/23 Transcript at 1064). The McDougal and Daniels stories were discussed for the same purpose -- helping Trump's electoral chances. Pecker admitted as much in no uncertain terms: his \"principal purpose\" in entering into an agreement with McDougal was to \"suppress her story as to prevent it from influencing the election\" (4/26 Transcript at 1455). The \"mutual\" part of the benefit went to the National Enquirer's audience, which thrived on Trump fandom from his days at The Apprentice, but Pecker's testimony showed that the tabloid suppressed stories that were \"Enquirer gold,\" in a favor to Trump's campaign that, the prosecution will argue, amounted to an unreported donation (4/26 Transcript at 1475). When the prosecution asked Pecker, did Trump \"ever say anything to you that made you think that his concern about these stories getting out was for his family, rather than for his campaign?\" Pecker answered, \"I thought it was for the campaign... the conversations that I had directly with Mr. Trump, his family wasn't mentioned\" (4/24 Transcript at 1214). The prosecution will find a way to remind the jurors of the federal non-prosecution agreement with AMI, in which the document and Pecker in his testimony admitted the federal election law violations.\n\nKeith Davidson testified about his negotiations with Pecker and Enquirer editor-in-chief Dylan Howard about selling the McDougal and Daniels stories. After the Access Hollywood tape scandal broke, Davidson texted Howard that \"Trump is f**ked,\" to which Howard responded \"wave the white flag, it's over people!\" (4/30 Transcript at 1755-6). This exchange further demonstrates how people connected to Trump's orbit perceived the scandal as potentially fatal to the campaign, and Davidson explained how the desire to suppress Daniels' story spiked after the scandal. (\"It wasn't until Access Hollywood that interest sort of reached a crescendo\" (4/30 Transcript at 1755).)\n\nHope Hicks, Trump's former campaign press secretary and White House communications director, provided further corroboration. She explained how the campaign was in crisis mode after the Access Hollywood tape came out: \"there was consensus among us all that the tape was damaging and this was a crisis\" (5/3 Transcript at 2156). Although Hicks acknowledged Trump was also concerned about how his wife would react to the news, expect the DA to argue she made clear the impact on the campaign was a primary concern. Hicks also testified that she found Trump's claim that Cohen secretly paid off Daniels out of the goodness of his heart to be implausible, and that Trump explicitly linked the suppression of that story to the 2016 election. She did so in the devastating end of her direct examination against her former boss -- delivered shortly before she cried on the witness stand. \"He wanted to know how it was playing, and just my thoughts and opinion about this story versus having the story - a different kind of story before the campaign had Michael not made that payment. And I think Mr. Trump's opinion was it was better to be dealing with it now, and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election\" (5/3 Transcript at 2221).\n\nLastly, Cohen ties everything together in terms of Trump's intent. The two men had multiple conversations about the Daniels payment. Cohen described how they discussed the need to bury the McDougal and Daniels stories and Trump ultimately approving the payment. Critically, Cohen described how, with Trump's permission, Cohen and Davidson agreed to the $130,000 payment on October 11, Trump tried to drag out the process until after the election. \"Because after the election, it wouldn't matter,\" Cohen said, \"According to Mr. Trump\" (5/13 Transcript at 3339). Others involved in those negotiations also testified to the foot dragging right in that time period.\n\nThis evidence cumulatively shows Trump's fraudulent intent to commit election fraud by concealing payments, and as discussed above, reimbursements, for a campaign expense. The DA, however, can point to a second intent to commit a crime in connection with Cohen's tax violations. Trump, as he described in Think Like a Billionaire, is a penny-pincher. Blanche acknowledged in his opening that Trump is a frugal businessman before asking why he would pay $420,000 for a $130,000 debt? (That question is not quite accurate, as the evidence showed Trump paid Cohen $260,000 for a $130,000 debt -- the other $160,000 was for other reasons.) But the answer is clear: Trump agreed to pay more because he knew that in order to continue the cover-up, Cohen would have to falsely claim that reimbursement as income and pay tax. That meant Cohen would have to file false tax documents. Trump is a savvy businessman who certainly understands tax basics. Indeed, the mere fact of grossing Cohen up to claim the payments as income is the violation of New York law. Trump knew disguising Cohen's reimbursement as income was inaccurate and wrong, thereby establishing more fraudulent intent, the prosecutors will claim.\n\n4. Bolstering Cohen\n\nIn its closing, expect the prosecution to confront head-on Cohen's credibility challenges, as it did in opening. The DA will do the best it can to focus on testimony other than that of Cohen, but it cannot avoid that the case depends in part on Cohen's credibility. The prosecution may raise at least five arguments to bolster Cohen's credibility.\n\nFirst, Cohen admitted and explained his mistakes, crimes, and lies. He owned up to what he did wrong, and he paid the price-having received a three-year prison sentence and three years of supervised release. As importantly, most of Cohen's misconduct revolved around the work he did for Trump, including his tax and campaign finance violations connected with the Daniels hush money payment and reimbursement. There is no doubt that Cohen worked for Trump, represented him as a lawyer and spokesman, and that Cohen was in Trump's inner circle. He is not an outsider pointing the finger at Trump from afar; he was Trump's lieutenant and did his boss's dirty work dutifully until Cohen's legal problems-stemming from Trump-finally caught up with him. Additionally, Cohen has admitted his bias. He has been honest with the jury about his hatred toward Trump, which they may see as understandable considering everything that he has been through, whereas Trump has never been held accountable for anything.\n\nSecond, witness testimony corroborates Cohen's account. Pecker and Davidson provided consistent testimony, and even Trump-friendly witnesses like Tarasoff and Hicks confirmed key details of Cohen's testimony. As did Gary Farro, the banker with whom Cohen worked to open the shell accounts, who was a less significant witness with no skin in the game, as he did not know Trump and did not conduct business with him.\n\nThird, documentary and other evidence corroborates Cohen. There is an extensive paper trial of bank records, emails, text messages, phone logs, and business records that support Cohen's testimony. There is also the audio recording of one important conversation between Cohen and Trump discussing the McDougal payment in detail.\n\nFourth, the DA will likely focus on Cohen's \"imperfect\" testimony. The defense will as we have noted argue that Cohen is a serial liar who cannot be believed. The prosecution can try to rebut this by pointing out that if Cohen was lying about Trump, he could have invented additional conversations or meetings with Trump. He could have testified that he and Trump specifically discussed campaign finance or tax violations, or the broader illegality of their conduct. He has admitted to lying under oath before, and if he were lying in this trial, what was to stop him from adding just one additional false anecdote that inculpates Trump. But Cohen didn't do that, prosecutors will argue. Instead, he testified as to what actually happened, and his testimony has been consistent over several years since he first came clean and testified under penalty of law to Congress.\n\nAlong these lines, expect the prosecution to take on the defense attack on Cohen's recollection of his Oct. 24, 2016 call. They may say if Cohen were a liar he would have tried to dissimulate. Instead he admitted that he had not recalled it and that his recollection was refreshed. They will rebut the defense claim about the words he used during that dramatic confrontation as simply doing his best to answer honestly. For example, when he said that Daniels \"could\" have been discussed he was just responding to Blanche's suggestion that it could not have been given the amount of time (5/16 Transcript at 3895). In fact, a 96-second call is ample time to discuss the two subjects (the entire, detailed back and forth between Cohen and Trump about the financial arrangements with McDaniels lasted half as long). And Cohen was corroborated by a mini-Perry Mason moment of the prosecution's own that we can expect to hear about: a screen grab of C-SPAN which showed Schiller with Trump immediately before the call at 7:58 p.m. The fact that they were together at that very time bolsters the likelihood that Schiller handed the phone over, making Cohen's original testimony, at minimum, plausible. What's more, this was not the crucial call with Trump, especially compared to the Oct. 26 morning phone calls right before Cohen opened the bank account and made the transfer; and the prosecutors can say explicitly that they do not need this Oct. 24 call to prove Trump was in the know about the Daniels payment.\n\nProsecutors may also note that some of Trump's attacks on Cohen's credibility, albeit counterintuitively, back up his account. Cohen's account of his theft of the Trump Organization -- that he falsely claimed a $60,000 reimbursement that he wasn't entitled to -- only makes sense if the jury believes that the $420,000 of which it was a part was not his legitimate legal fees. That corroborates the prosecution case and is contrary to the defense's apparent claim that these were monthly legal fees. Trump's defense has depicted Cohen as motivated by revenge, self-promotion and personal interest, but Cohen's self-interest is the very attribute that made Hicks believe he would never have paid $130,000 to Daniels without expecting reimbursement from the former president. Cohen is a convicted perjurer, but his only conviction for false statements to Congress came for a lie he told for Trump, disguising how Trump's failed negotiations to build a billion-dollar tower in Moscow extended much longer into 2016 campaign season than the campaign publicly acknowledged. And then there is his pleading guilty to the federal election law crime with the hush money payment, which adds to his credibility in this particular case. In short, the most damaging blots on Cohen's credibility -- his lies, selfishness and admitted theft -- may help the prosecution more than the defense.\n\n5. The People's Bottom Line\n\nAt the end of their closing expect the prosecution to make an appeal to the importance of the case and of holding Trump accountable. They will emphasize that this was no minor peccadillo, but as they noted in their opening, was a serious \"conspiracy\" to \"corrupt\" the 2016 election (4/22 Transcript at 857). We will never know whether efforts to cover up unfolding scandals after the release of the Access Hollywood tape changed the outcome of the election, but the fact that that question will forever hang over the contest speaks to the gravity of the wrongdoing. In his opening statement, Assistant District Attorney Matthew Colangelo revealed that Daniels' then-attorney Keith Davidson sent an explosive text message to then-Enquirer editor-in-chief Dylan Howard on election night, when it appeared Trump was destined to win: \"What have we done?\" Jurors have now seen that text message, along with Howard's three-word response: \"Oh my god,\" declining to dispute the premise of the question that their hush money schemes had made the difference. Also on Election Night, Howard told a close relative in a text message that Trump may pardon him for \"electoral fraud,\" but the jury has not seen that message because of the rules of evidence. (Howard, unwell and in Australia, was unable to testify.)\n\nThough they cannot use the information to find Trump guilty, jurors now know that Cohen pleaded guilty to violating federal election law for related conduct, and Pecker testified that AMI entered into a non-prosecution agreement and admitted to a campaign violation with Trump and Cohen (4/25 Transcript at 1242). Prosecutors may argue that not allowing Trump to get away with covering up campaign crimes of his own and document falsification is important too, for the sake of democracy -- and more. New York is the financial center of the world, and we cannot have two sets of rules, one for ex-presidents and one for everybody else. Every business that operates in New York needs to know they must keep honest books and records. Expect prosecutors to finish by emphasizing that this jury is entrusted with the responsibility to make sure there is accountability for all of that.\n\nAlthough the summations will range across a much broader set of topics, we expect they will hinge on three key issues. First, expect a focus on Cohen's credibility. Second, look for a debate on whether the business records were or were not false and whether or not Trump was the cause. Third and finally, anticipate the parties to dispute whether Trump intended those documents to cover up predicate crimes -- and in particular whether his mental state does or does not not rise to the level necessary for that finding. As the jury lands on those three issues, their verdict will likely follow.", "source": {"uri": "justsecurity.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Just Security"}, "authors": [{"uri": "norman_l_eisen@justsecurity.org", "name": "Norman L.

Guilty or innocent, their decision will shake the United States.\n\nThey must decide whether the former and perhaps future president is a criminal, just months before an election that could put him back in the White House.\n\nThe panel of 12 ordinary New Yorkers will start deliberations this week and they must reach a unanimous verdict, or the case will be declared a mistrial.\n\nHere are some of the pressing questions ahead:\n\n- What will jury be asked to decide? -\n\nMuch attention has been paid to the salacious details that have emerged in the trial, particularly from porn star Stormy Daniels who alleged a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006.\n\nBut the case ultimately boils down to whether Trump knowingly covered up a $130,000 payment to Daniels for her silence in an effort to prevent her claims derailing his 2016 presidential battle against Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe jury must decide not only if Trump caused the records of payments to be falsified, but that he did so to cover up another crime -- an undeclared campaign donation in this case -- making it a felony.\n\nDepending on the judge's instructions to the jurors, the 12 panelists could be asked to consider whether the alleged cover-up was a lesser misdemeanor if the threshold for a felony conviction is not surpassed -- though this is seen as unlikely.\n\n- What are their options? -\n\nThe jury would have to agree unanimously to find Trump either guilty or not guilty.\n\nTrump's defense team has sought to sow doubts in the minds of one or two holdouts in the jury, which is all that would be needed to spare the property mogul a conviction, causing a mistrial.\n\nMore from this section Yemen's Houthis Escalated Campaign Against Regional Shipping, Claim Attack Over 3 Vessels | Oneindia WATCH IN FULL: Bionic MP Craig Mackinlay opens up on emotional health battle after suffering sepsis Royals shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. visits second-graders to promote reading and literacy\n\nThe tortuous jury selection process at the start of the trial probed jurors' media consumption and feelings towards Trump in microscopic detail, revealing at least one follows the former president on his Truth Social platform.\n\n- Could Trump end up behind bars? -\n\nYes, former president Trump could go to prison.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan has come close to jailing the far-right populist for breaches of a gag order in place to protect witnesses, the jury and family members of some of those involved in the trial.\n\nBut experts say a fine, probation or community service are all far more likely options.\n\n- Would conviction impact Trump campaign? -\n\nA guilty verdict could hurt Trump's standing with \"law and order conservatives\" who could be put off by a criminal record. Religious, pro-family voters could also be deterred by the appearance that Trump cheated on his wife with a porn star.\n\nAn ABC News-Ipsos poll earlier this month found 16 percent of Trump supporters would reconsider their support for him if he were to be convicted of a felony.\n\nTrump would almost certainly appeal the conviction, kicking the issue down the road until after the election.\n\nWhatever happens, Trump can still run for president, be elected to office and once again take the presidential oath -- even if he has been convicted or even jailed.\n\nbur-gw/bgs/acb",

Experts say that's not unusual", "body": "NEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump's legal team rested its case Tuesday in his hush money trial after calling just two witnesses and opting not to have the former president take the stand in his own defense.\n\nBut despite what Hollywood courtroom dramas might suggest, that isn't all that unusual, according to criminal defense lawyers and former prosecutors.\n\nThe reason is simple: Prosecutors need to prove their case, while the defense only has to show there's reasonable doubt their client committed a crime. And defense lawyers don't necessarily need to call different witnesses to knock holes in a prosecutor's case.\n\n\"The burden is on the prosecution, and it's a high burden,\" said Sarah Krissoff, a white-collar defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor in New York.\n\nTrump has been charged with falsifying records at his company in order to disguise the true nature of payments made in 2017 to one of his lawyers, Michael Cohen. Prosecutors say the money was for Cohen's work suppressing negative stories about his boss during the 2016 presidential campaign, including one about an alleged sexual encounter with a porn actor, Stormy Daniels. Trump, who denies Daniels' account, has said the company properly classified them as legal expenses.\n\nMost of the work of defense lawyers, Krissoff and other experts said, happens during cross-examination of the prosecution's witnesses, when they can challenge their testimony and credibility.\n\n\"The defense narrative comes through during cross-examination, then they will tie it all together during the closing statement,\" she explained.\n\nIt isn't unusual for defense lawyers to call just a few witnesses of their own, or none at all.\n\nA lot of the defense team's work happens before the trial begins, and involves trying to make sure incriminating evidence isn't admitted into the trial and is never seen or heard by the jury, Krissoff added.\n\n\"What you see in a courtroom is really only a sliver of the work they're doing,\" she said.\n\nAnd while Trump has for weeks dangled the prospect of testifying, legal experts say that was never likely to happen.\n\n\"There was no guarantee that if Trump testified that he would stay on point and not go completely off script in ways that would be, at best, not helpful to the defense and, at worst, harmful to them,\" said Richard Serafini, a criminal defense attorney in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and former prosecutor with the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nKrissoff agreed, adding that having a defendant testify can also open the door for other evidence and information to be introduced in trial that could be harmful.\n\n\"They've done the calculus and decided that they've made enough inroads,\" she explained, referring to Trump's lawyers. \"They feel they've done the damage to the prosecution's case and they're going to be able to stand up next week and argue that there isn't enough to convict the former president.\"\n\nIf anything, legal experts said, it was surprising that Trump's lawyers called any witnesses.\n\nThe defense's main witness was attorney Robert Costello, who testified Monday and Tuesday about conversations he had with Cohen in 2018, after the FBI raided Cohen's home and office. Costello testified that Cohen told him at the time that Trump knew nothing about $130,000 in hush money paid to Daniels.\n\n\"I'm not sure that Costello moved the needle in favor of Trump,\" said Mark Bederow, a New York criminal defense lawyer and former prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney's office. But he and other legal experts said Trump's lawyers rightly zeroed in on Cohen's credibility.\n\nCohen testified that Trump knew all about the scheme to pay off Daniels. But under cross-examination, he also admitted stealing thousands of dollars from Trump's company and lying during congressional testimony. Cohen also claimed he was innocent of crimes, including tax evasion and bank fraud, despite having pleaded guilty to those crimes in 2018. Cohen said his guilty pleas were, themselves, lies.\n\n\"His lack of credibility is just shocking, in terms of his personal bias, his financial motives, his lying and stealing from the company that he was working with, his dishonesty and tape recording his own client,\" Bederow said.\n\nOne potential witness who never wound up taking the stand was Allen Weisselberg, the former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization. According to the testimony of some witnesses, Weisselberg had knowledge of the payments made to Cohen.\n\nBut Weisselberg was sentenced last month to five months in jail for lying under oath during his testimony in the civil fraud lawsuit brought against Trump by New York's attorney general.\n\n\"The problem was neither side could really call him,\" Krissoff said. \"He's in custody for lying in a courtroom in the recent past. It was impossible for him to be a credible witness.\"", "source": {"uri": "accesswdun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Access WDUN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-collar_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White-collar crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_New_York", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Weisselberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allen Weisselberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax evasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

The trial has gripped the US as it could see the first time a former president has been found guilty over criminal charges.\n\nJudge Merchan said he expects closings to take a full day, maybe longer. After that, he said, he'll instruct jurors in the law for about an hour before sending them to deliberate.\n\nHe said that could happen as early as next Wednesday. Speaking to the Mirror, Gregory Germain, Professor of Law at Syracuse University explained what could happen next in the trial and how Trump's actions throughout could affect the jury's decisions.\n\nREAD MORE: Stormy Daniels receiving 'death threats' amid Donald Trump hush money case\n\nJuan Merchan found Trump repeatedly violated limited gag orders imposed on the case after the Republican presidential frontrunner spoke out about trial witnesses and jurors. Professor Germain said: \"I doubt that there are any Trump supporters on the jury, and I think they are likely very offended by Trump's conduct in and out of court, and with the unethical behaviour.\n\n\"So, even though only one juror is necessary for Trump to obtain a mistrial, and even though it's a very flawed case, I predict that the jury will convict him.\" Despite this, the professor did highlight possible flaws in the prosecution's case.\n\nHe said: \"I think the DA and the Judge are fully invested in obtaining a conviction. I think the judge will gloss over the legal issues in the jury instructions to allow a conviction by defining the legal issue around the propriety of paying hush money rather than the legality of paying hush money and how that relates to the documents charges.\"\n\nAssistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass is slated to give the prosecution's closing and is likely to highlight portions of the evidence and testimony that it sees as supporting its case. The defence is likely to remind jurors of the inconsistencies and credibility issues it sees in many of the prosecution's key witnesses, while also underscoring Trump's insistence that he is innocent.\n\nSince the prosecution has the burden of proof, it will deliver its summation last -- the reverse order from opening statements where the prosecution went first. Giving his opinion Professor Germain also said: \"I have been very critical of the DA for bringing such a flawed case, and of the judge for pushing the case forward in such a confusing way, given all of the legal problems with the claims in the indictment.\n\n\"I don't think the DA proved that Trump committed fraud and a separate crime by facilitating the recording of the business records to show attorney fees rather than reimbursing hush money payments.\"\n\nHe added: \"Ultimately, I think the verdict will be reversed on appeal. If the judge sentences Trump to prison, then the courts will intervene quickly. If Trump isn't sentenced to prison, the appeal will take its sweet time and be reversed after the election.\"\n\nAnother political expert reinforced the idea the political situation of the high-profile trial could weigh on the jury as they make their decisions. Grant Reeher, director of the Campbell Public Affairs Institute and a professor of political science at Syracuse University, said: \"I imagine the experience of being in the same room with Donald Trump for extended periods of time, and taking part in a super high-profile case. Knowing that the country and the world will be scrutinising the outcome must have some effect. Something like the O. J. Simpson case, where it seemed that the jurors were making a political statement about race and the criminal justice system, versus the facts of that specific case.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlie_jones@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Charlie Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_instructions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury instructions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gag order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Syracuse University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burden of proof (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opening statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

Guilty or innocent, their decision will shake the United States.\n\nThey must decide whether the former and perhaps future president is a criminal, just months before an election that could put him back in the White House.\n\nThe panel of 12 ordinary New Yorkers will start deliberations this week and they must reach a unanimous verdict, or the case will be declared a mistrial.\n\nHere are some of the pressing questions ahead:\n\n- What will jury be asked to decide? -\n\nMuch attention has been paid to the salacious details that have emerged in the trial, particularly from porn star Stormy Daniels who alleged a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006.\n\nBut the case ultimately boils down to whether Trump knowingly covered up a $130,000 payment to Daniels for her silence in an effort to prevent her claims derailing his 2016 presidential battle against Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe jury must decide not only if Trump caused the records of payments to be falsified, but that he did so to cover up another crime -- an undeclared campaign donation in this case -- making it a felony.\n\nDepending on the judge's instructions to the jurors, the 12 panelists could be asked to consider whether the alleged cover-up was a lesser misdemeanor if the threshold for a felony conviction is not surpassed -- though this is seen as unlikely.\n\n- What are their options? -\n\nThe jury would have to agree unanimously to find Trump either guilty or not guilty.\n\nTrump's defense team has sought to sow doubts in the minds of one or two holdouts in the jury, which is all that would be needed to spare the property mogul a conviction, causing a mistrial.\n\nThe tortuous jury selection process at the start of the trial probed jurors' media consumption and feelings towards Trump in microscopic detail, revealing at least one follows the former president on his Truth Social platform.\n\n- Could Trump end up behind bars? -\n\nYes, former president Trump could go to prison.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan has come close to jailing the far-right populist for breaches of a gag order in place to protect witnesses, the jury and family members of some of those involved in the trial.\n\nBut experts say a fine, probation or community service are all far more likely options.\n\n- Would conviction impact Trump campaign? -\n\nA guilty verdict could hurt Trump's standing with \"law and order conservatives\" who could be put off by a criminal record. Religious, pro-family voters could also be deterred by the appearance that Trump cheated on his wife with a porn star.\n\nAn ABC News-Ipsos poll earlier this month found 16 percent of Trump supporters would reconsider their support for him if he were to be convicted of a felony.\n\nTrump would almost certainly appeal the conviction, kicking the issue down the road until after the election.\n\nWhatever happens, Trump can still run for president, be elected to office and once again take the presidential oath -- even if he has been convicted or even jailed.\n\nbur-gw/bgs/acb\n\nMore from this section\n\nHuman Rights Group Marches in Protest to Demand RANZCP End Dangerous Coercive Psychiatric Practices as Advised by the World Health Organization

Closing arguments are coming", "body": "NEW YORK (AP) -- After 22 witnesses, including a porn actor, tabloid publisher and White House insiders, testimony is over at Donald Trump's criminal trial in New York.\n\nProsecutors called 20 witnesses. The defense called just two. Trump decided not to testify on his own behalf.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe trial now shifts to closing arguments, scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nAfter that, it will be up to 12 jurors to decide whether prosecutors have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified his company's business records as part of a broader effort to keep stories about marital infidelity from becoming public during his 2016 presidential campaign. He has pleaded not guilty and denies any wrongdoing.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nA conviction could come down to how the jurors interpret the testimony and which witnesses they find credible. The jury must be unanimous. The records involved include 11 checks sent to Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, as well as invoices and company ledger entries related to those payments.\n\nHere's a look at key trial witnesses and what they had to say:\n\nSTORMY DANIELS\n\nAs Trump sat feet away, the porn actor, writer and director, gave a detailed and at times graphic account of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump in Nevada in 2006. After they met at a celebrity golf tournament, she said, Trump invited her to dinner but then engaged her in conversation in his hotel room and startled her by stripping to his underwear while she was in the bathroom.\n\n\"I felt the room spin in slow motion. I felt the blood basically leave my hands and my feet,\" Daniels testified. \"I just thought, 'Oh, my God, what did I misread to get here?' Because the intention was pretty clear, somebody stripped down in their underwear and posing on the bed, like waiting for you.\"\n\nDaniels said Trump did not physically threaten her, but \"my own insecurities in that moment kept me from saying no.\" Daniels said she kept in touch with Trump for about a year in hopes of appearing on his TV show \"The Apprentice,\" but it never happened.\n\nDaniels spoke about accepting $15,000 for a magazine interview in 2011. The story was not printed at the time but ended up on a gossip website without her consent. Her lawyer, in consultation with Cohen, complained and had the story taken down.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn 2016, Daniels authorized her manager to shop her story again but found little interest until the release of the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" recording of Trump boasting about grabbing women's genitals without their permission.\n\nDaniels told the jury she accepted $130,000 from Cohen in the final weeks of the election in exchange for a legal agreement to keep the claim to herself.\n\nTrump's lawyers grilled Daniels about her motivation, eliciting testimony that she hates the former Republican president. She pushed back on the defense's suggestion that her story was fabricated, saying if it was fiction, \"I would have written it to be a lot better.\"\n\nDaniels' testimony was among the most awaited in the trial.

SISAK, JENNIFER PELTZ and JAKE OFFENHARTZ - Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- After 22 witnesses, including a porn actor, tabloid publisher and White House insiders, testimony is over at Donald Trump's criminal trial in New York.\n\nProsecutors called 20 witnesses. The defense called just two. Trump decided not to testify on his own behalf.\n\nThe trial now shifts to closing arguments, scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nAfter that, it will be up to 12 jurors to decide whether prosecutors have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified his company's business records as part of a broader effort to keep stories about marital infidelity from becoming public during his 2016 presidential campaign. He has pleaded not guilty and denies any wrongdoing.\n\nA conviction could come down to how the jurors interpret the testimony and which witnesses they find credible. The jury must be unanimous. The records involved include 11 checks sent to Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, as well as invoices and company ledger entries related to those payments.\n\nPeople are also reading...

After they met at a celebrity golf tournament, she said, Trump invited her to dinner but then engaged her in conversation in his hotel room and startled her by stripping to his underwear while she was in the bathroom.\n\n\"I felt the room spin in slow motion. I felt the blood basically leave my hands and my feet,\" Daniels testified. \"I just thought, 'Oh, my God, what did I misread to get here?' Because the intention was pretty clear, somebody stripped down in their underwear and posing on the bed, like waiting for you.\"\n\nDaniels said Trump did not physically threaten her, but \"my own insecurities in that moment kept me from saying no.\" Daniels said she kept in touch with Trump for about a year in hopes of appearing on his TV show \"The Apprentice,\" but it never happened.\n\nDaniels spoke about accepting $15,000 for a magazine interview in 2011. The story was not printed at the time but ended up on a gossip website without her consent. Her lawyer, in consultation with Cohen, complained and had the story taken down.\n\nIn 2016, Daniels authorized her manager to shop her story again but found little interest until the release of the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" recording of Trump boasting about grabbing women's genitals without their permission.\n\nDaniels told the jury she accepted $130,000 from Cohen in the final weeks of the election in exchange for a legal agreement to keep the claim to herself.\n\nTrump's lawyers grilled Daniels about her motivation, eliciting testimony that she hates the former Republican president. She pushed back on the defense's suggestion that her story was fabricated, saying if it was fiction, \"I would have written it to be a lot better.\"\n\nDaniels' testimony was among the most awaited in the trial. She had shared her story before, but this was the first time she testified about it in front of Trump. Trump's lawyers objected to much of Daniels' testimony and twice sought a mistrial, arguing that her feelings of a power imbalance with Trump and her blunt answers about the alleged sexual encounter should not have been put before the jury.\n\nDAVID PECKER\n\nA longtime Trump friend, Pecker was the publisher of the National Enquirer and chief executive of its parent company, American Media Inc., during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nPecker told the jury he agreed to be the \"eyes and ears\" of Trump's campaign, looking out for damaging stories so they could be suppressed. He said he agreed to the role -- and to a plan to publish positive stories about Trump and negative stories about his opponents -- at an August 2015 meeting with Trump and Cohen.\n\n\"If there were any rumors in the marketplace about Mr. Trump or his family or any negative stories that were coming out or anything that I heard overall,\" Pecker said, \"I would call Michael Cohen directly.\"\n\nHe said he told the National Enquirer's editor at the time, Dylan Howard, \"that we are going to try to help the campaign, and to do that, I want to keep this as quiet as possible.\"\n\nPecker testified that the company squashed one potential story by paying $30,000 to a Trump Tower doorman.

Under defense questioning, she acknowledged permission to cut Cohen's checks came not from Trump himself, but from Weisselberg and McConney.\n\nMADELEINE WESTERHOUT: Trump's White House secretary from 2017 to 2019 testified about Trump signing checks, saying he sometimes would sign without reviewing them.\n\nAssociated Press writers Eric Tucker, Alanna Durkin Richer and Colleen Long in Washington and Michelle L.

Here's what each outcome could mean for the election.", "body": "The verdict could influence some voters in a close presidential race in key swing states like Pennsylvania.\n\nTwelve jurors in New York City are poised to make history when they reveal the verdict in the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president.\n\nThe decision could influence some voters in a close presidential race in key swing states like Pennsylvania with six months until the election.\n\nClosing arguments in former President Donald Trump's hush money trial are slated for Tuesday with jury deliberations likely to start on Wednesday.\n\nProsecutors have alleged that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee engaged in a strategy to acquire and suppress unfavorable news stories, to impact the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Trump has pleaded not guilty to falsifying business records to cover up the purported scheme. It's the first of Trump's four criminal cases to go to trial, and likely the only one to be tried before the Nov. 5 election.\n\nAs the campaign barrels toward November, the hush money trial has done little to shift a tight race. That's partly because polling shows few voters are paying attention to it.\n\nIn a recent YouGov/Yahoo News poll, just 16% of respondents said they'd been following the trial \"very closely,\" with one-third saying they were taking a mild interest in proceedings. More Americans said the trial made them feel \"bored\" or \"angry\" than interested.\n\nThat's somewhat surprising given the salacious subject matter -- a former adult film star detailing an alleged sexual encounter with a presidential candidate. But Trump has a long history of outrageous behavior, and if the facts of the case have not motivated voters en masse, a legal outcome of them might not either.\n\n\"I think even his most ardent supporters, given who he is, can believe everything they said he did,\" GOP consultant Chris Nicholas said. \"Whether it ends up being found to be felonious criminally is another story.\"\n\nHere's what we're watching for in the three scenarios that could play out.\n\nIf the jury finds Trump guilty, he would be eligible for a prison sentence, an unprecedented scenario that the Secret Service is already taking preemptive steps to prepare for.\n\nEach of the 34 felony falsification of business records charges that Trump is facing carries a sentence of up to four years in prison and a $5,000 fine. If Trump is found guilty, Judge Juan Merchan would have a lot of leeway. He could sentence Trump to probation, house arrest, or prison.\n\nGiven Trump, 77, has no prior criminal record, many legal experts say it's unlikely the judge would impose a prison sentence. Trump would also likely appeal a guilty verdict, and any jail time would be stayed as the appeal continues through the court system, a process that could take months, if not years.\n\nStill, the case against Trump for Democrats and Biden becomes easier to make with a guilty verdict. The Biden campaign is preparing to start referring to Trump as \"convicted felon Donald Trump,\" should he be found guilty.\n\nAnd polling has indicated a guilty verdict could erode some support.\n\nA March Politico and Ipsos survey found that a conviction could cost Trump more than one-third of independents. A February NBC News poll showed that a conviction in the New York trial could trigger a big swing from 18- to 34-year-old voters from Trump to Biden. And an ABC News/Ipsos survey from late April found that 20% of Trump supporters polled would \"either reconsider their support (16%) or withdraw it (4%)\" if he's convicted.\n\nThere's little sign that avid supporters have abandoned Trump over his legal troubles in states like Pennsylvania, but even smaller shifts could matter in a tight race.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, will likely continue to run -- and fundraise -- off of the trial, no matter the outcome. He's turned the indictments into unifying rallying calls to his supporters.\n\n\"Every time the radical left Democrats, Marxists, communists, and fascists indict me, I consider it a great badge of honor,\" Trump said in his recent rally in Wildwood. \"I am being indicted for you and never forget our enemies want to take my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom. They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you.\"\n\nAs he did in Wildwood, Trump, for months, has categorized the case against him as a politically motivated prosecution. An acquittal would represent validation for Trump, his supporters, and his lineup of potential running mates, many of whom have packed the courtroom.\n\nWhile he faces three other criminal trials, it's unlikely any of those cases will conclude ahead of the general election, meaning an acquittal frees Trump from the possibility of running as a convicted candidate -- or a candidate in jail.\n\nThat could help him among undecided voters with whom the outcome of the cases carries some weight.\n\nTrump leads Biden in national polls and most swing states but in Pennsylvania his lead is narrow. His challenge has always been how to expand his base beyond a dedicated core. Running on an acquittal helps him make the case to moderates and independent voters.\n\nIt puts Biden's Democratic surrogates in a more difficult position having spent months defending the trial against Trump.\n\nAnd while an acquittal wouldn't directly impact the other pending cases in Florida, Georgia, and Washington, it could shape public perception and influence potential juries in those states.\n\nIf the jury cannot reach a verdict, the judge will likely declare a mistrial. The Manhattan district attorney can then choose to retry the case with a new jury. But the runway to the election is shortening, making a retrial before November unlikely.\n\nTrump would likely cast a mistrial as a win.\n\nWhatever the outcome, how both candidates respond could carry almost as much weight as the decision. Biden has avoided commenting on the legal cases, but his campaign indicated he'll make a statement on the verdict.\n\nAnd Trump will be even more free to speak out with the trial behind him.\n\n\"The wild card, of course, is how does he respond?\" Nicholas, the GOP consultant, said. \"Once the verdict is in, he doesn't have the gag order anymore, so he's off to the races in terms of what he says.\"", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julia_terruso@inquirer.com", "name": "Julia Terruso", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deliberation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

According to Cohen, he paid porn actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 in so-called hush money to keep quiet about an alleged affair with the former president. Cohen claimed that Trump instructed him to execute the settlement agreement with Daniels.\n\n'They haven't even alleged a crime here.'\n\nTrump paid Cohen $35,000 monthly in 2017, a total of $420,000. The checks made out to Cohen, Trump's personal attorney at the time, were marked as legal expenses. However, Cohen claimed that the funds were reimbursements for a number of costs, including the $130,000 settlement payment to Daniels, $50,000 for technology services to RedFinch, and $180,000 for estimated taxes, and a $60,000 bonus.\n\nWill Chamberlain, with the Article III Project, told Blaze News that the New York criminal case against Trump \"never should have been brought,\" explaining that the prosecution's arguments rely \"on the testimony of a convicted felon, admitted perjurer, and disbarred attorney.\"\n\n\"[Cohen's] testimony is the only evidence at all on necessary intent elements of the alleged crime,\" Chamberlain stated. \"No reasonable juror can rely solely on Cohen to prove anything beyond a reasonable doubt, and [Judge Juan] Merchan should have dismissed the case outright.\"\n\nCriminal defense attorney David W. Fischer told Blaze News, \"The prosecution has not established that a criminal offense took place.\"\n\nDuring Cohen's testimony, he admitted that, despite getting reimbursed by the Trump Organization for a payment to RedFinch, he only paid the technology firm $20,000 and pocketed the remaining $30,000. Cohen's reimbursement for the expense also included another $30,000 in estimated taxes. He claimed Trump shortchanged him on his yearly bonus.\n\n\"I was angered because of the reduction in the bonus, and so I just felt it was almost like self-help,\" Cohen admitted to jurors. \"And again $130,000 to have my bonus cut by two-thirds was very upsetting to say the least.\"\n\nChamberlain told Blaze News that Cohen's admission to stealing $60,000 from the Trump Organization undermined his previous testimony that Trump was a micromanager.\n\n\"Even assuming one would be inclined to embezzle, how stupid would you have to be to embezzle from someone you know is a micromanager?\" Chamberlain questioned.\n\nThe defense team maintained that the payments to Cohen were for his legal services as Trump's personal attorney. Cohen claimed he never had a retainer agreement with Trump and did not expect to be paid as the president's lawyer.\n\nWhile on the stand, Cohen admitted to previously lying under oath many times, but he claimed he did so to protect Trump.\n\nFormer federal prosecutor and former Trump attorney Jim Trusty told Blaze News, \"The reality is, there's no corroboration in Cohen's testimony about what Trump knew and what his intentions were.\"\n\n\"In a normal world with a normal jury, this case is a joke. But it's hard to gauge in Manhattan,\" he noted.\n\nRobert Costello, Cohen's former attorney and one of only two witnesses called by the defense, painted Cohen as a self-serving \"inveterate liar,\" according to testimony he provided during a House committee hearing on the Weaponization of the Federal Government.\n\nDuring his time on the stand in the New York criminal trial, Costello claimed that Cohen repeatedly told him in mid-2018 that he did not have any incriminating evidence against Trump and that he made the payment to Daniels without Trump's knowledge. Costello argued that Cohen was desperate to win favor with Trump and secure a spot on his presidential Cabinet.\n\n\"Michael Cohen said numerous times that President Trump knew nothing about those payments, that he did this on his own. He repeated that numerous times,\" Costello testified.\n\nDuring his first day on the stand, Costello clashed with the judge overseeing the case, acting Justice Juan Merchan, Blaze News previously reported. The attorney rolled his eyes, audibly sighed, and remarked, \"Ridiculous,\" when the judge ruled to sustain multiple objections from the prosecution during his testimony. Costello's frustration prompted the Merchan to briefly clear the courtroom.\n\nFormer Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo told Blaze News that Trump's legal team has \"done a good job,\" noting that they \"successfully destroyed\" Cohen's credibility with Costello.\n\n\"They have made clear to all that the prosecution has failed to show that the bookkeeping misdemeanor actually advanced some greater felony. That greater felony has barely been mentioned, not to mention proved, at trial,\" Yoo explained.\n\nTrusty told Blaze News, \"We're at the end of the trial, and we're waiting with bated breath to hear what the theory of felonization is. That is unlike any trial I could ever think of that you go through the entire trial and it's still an open question of how this is a felony case.\"\n\nSo far, throughout the trial, Merchan has appeared to disproportionately side with Bragg's team, which has some legal experts questioning how the judge will choose to instruct the jury regarding the charges.\n\n'That's an area where the judge's instructions could make a huge difference.'\n\nMerchan previously placed a gag order against Trump, prohibiting him from speaking about anyone involved in the case or their relatives. His supporters have sounded the alarm, claiming that the order was, in part, intended to stop Trump from publicly discussing Merchan's daughter, who works for a progressive political consulting firm. The defense made multiple unsuccessful attempts to get Merchan booted from the case over the alleged \"actual conflict\" and \"unacceptable appearance of impropriety.\"\n\nAdditionally, the gag order prevents Trump from discussing Matthew Colangelo, a former top-ranking Department of Justice official who effectively took a demotion to join Bragg's prosecution team in the case against the former president. In 2018, Colangelo received $12,000 from the Democratic National Committee for \"political consulting,\" Blaze News previously reported.\n\nIn a recent letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) stated that Colangelo working as a New York prosecutor for Bragg has \"given the perception that the Justice Department is assisting in\" the \"politicized prosecution\" of Trump.\n\nThe restrictive gag order has also inhibited Trump from defending himself from political attacks from witnesses amid his 2024 presidential run. Cohen has repeatedly used his podcast and TikTok account to attack Trump's character and his campaign. At one point during the trial, after several failed attempts to get the gag order removed, the defense proposed placing a similar order against Cohen, but Merchan refused the request. Instead, the judge elected to tell the prosecution to remind Cohen that he should not speak about the trial publicly.\n\nThe prosecution and the defense are expected to give closing arguments this week. After the defense rested its case on Tuesday, the lawyers discussed the parameters of the jury instruction, arguably one of the most vital stages of the trial.\n\n\"The jury instructions may tilt the field against the defense, the last thing the judge could do to favor the prosecution,\" Yoo told Blaze News.\n\nDespite not being charged with any election interference-related crimes, the prosecution has argued that the alleged falsified business records amounted to Trump attempting to illegally sway the 2016 election.\n\nTrusty described two focal points for the judge's jury instruction.\n\n\"The first is, how does [the judge] instruct on the government's proof of Trump's knowledge of the false entries?\" he said.\n\n\"There's a big difference between a judge saying that the government must prove that the entries were false and that President Trump knew, or should have known, about them,\" Trusty told Blaze News. \"The other way you could say it is, the government has to prove that these entries that were made were false and that President Trump, beyond a reasonable doubt, was complicit in making these entries.\"\n\nHe noted that the jury may decide not to proceed if it determines that the prosecution failed to prove that Trump knew what was being entered on the checks and ledgers.\n\nTrusty continued, \"That's an area where the judge's instructions could make a huge difference. The other area is the felony part,\" which claims that the false entries were done in furtherance of another crime.\n\n\"If the judge instructs that political motivation need only be one part of the overall motivation for false entries, well, that's a no-brainer,\" Trusty explained. \"Even if [Trump] was primarily focused on Melania, or keeping it quiet just for his general reputation, it's not hard to convince a jury that at least some tiny part of it related to the presidential election. But if he says it has to be entirely motivated by politics, by political viability, then that's a much higher burden for the government because being afraid of your wife finding out could be a full defense.\"\n\nChamberlain told Blaze News that the most significant obstacles for the defense in this case \"are the bias of the judge and the potential bias of the jury.\"\n\n\"Manhattan is a very blue area, and they have to worry that the jury will look to convict Trump regardless of what the evidence supports,\" he said.\n\nChamberlain argued that the prosecution has \"failed\" to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\"The defense's best strategy is to try and make this case about the law and the facts and to point out how not credible Michael Cohen is,\" he added.\n\nYoo explained that the defense \"still has to fight not just a politically biased prosecutor but a judge who clearly looks poorly upon the defense.\"\n\nCriminal defense attorney Fischer told Blaze News that he believes there is a more straightforward argument for dismissing the case.\n\n\"The statute makes it a crime. It deals with the falsification of business records,\" Fischer said. \"To falsify a record means to take an existing record and change it in a way that changes the character of the record.\"\n\n\"It is not the addition of a false record into a business. If you carefully go through the indictment ... the most important words to read are the words 'to wit,' which means, essentially, the grand jury specifically charges as follows,\" he remarked.\n\nBragg's first count against Trump states, \"The defendant ... on or about February 14, 2017, with intent to defraud and intent to commit another crime and aid and conceal the commission thereof, made and caused a false entry in the business records of an enterprise, to wit, an invoice from Michael Cohen dated February 14, 2017, marked as a record of the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, and kept and maintained by the Trump Organization.\"\n\nFischer explained that because the term \"to wit\" is used, the prosecution must prove the \"elements of the crime\" as well as the specific set of facts alleged by the grand jury.\n\n\"When the grand jury specifically specifies a particular way that the crime was committed, the prosecutors stuck with that allegation,\" he told Blaze News. Fischer added that a case can be overturned if the judge provides jury instruction that does not align with the exact allegations made by the grand jury.\n\n\"So what is the false entry that Trump allegedly made in the business records? The false entry is, 'to wit, an invoice from Michael Cohen.' What they've alleged is that Michael Cohen sending an invoice from his law firm to the Trump Organization is a false entry in the business records. Well, that's not a crime,\" Fischer continued. \"That is not an entry in the business records of the Trump Organization. It's basically somebody sending their invoice.\"\n\nRegarding the false entry counts, Fischer believes the prosecution \"clearly ha[s] not met their burden.\"\n\n\"They haven't even alleged a crime here,\" he added.\n\nFischer noted the seventh count against Trump, which states that there was a \"false entry in the business records of an enterprise, to wit, a Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust Account check and check stub.\"\n\n\"In the light most favorable to Alvin Bragg, which is how the court would look at it, how is writing a check on a trust account -- how is that making a false entry in the Trump Organization records? It's not,\" he told Blaze News, adding that Trump's trust is not part of the company.\n\nFischer stated that \"there are multiple other arguments\" the defense could make, including contending that the prosecution has failed to prove that Trump had anything to do with marking the payments to Cohen as legal expenses.\n\n\"I don't think they have proof that Trump ordered, 'Hey, write this in the books a certain way.' I mean, what if it had been written in as miscellaneous expenses?\" Fischer continued. \"I don't believe it was an entry, first of all. But even if it was an entry, it has to be objectively false.\"", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

After that, it is anyone's guess when they will return and what they'll decide.\n\nBut if he is found guilty on even one count - just one of a few possible outcomes - Mr Trump would become the first former US president with a criminal conviction, and the first major party candidate to run for the White House as a felon.\n\nHere are some key issues to consider if a guilty verdict is delivered.\n\nWhat happens with a guilty verdict?\n\nMr Trump has been free on bail throughout the trial. If the verdict is guilty, he will probably still be able to leave the court as a free man until Justice Juan Merchan schedules a sentencing hearing.\n\nThe judge has several factors to consider in sentencing, including Mr Trump's age (77), lack of previous conviction and possibly his violations of the court's gag orders.\n\nThe sentence could involve a fine, probation or supervision, or possibly prison time.\n\nMr Trump would almost certainly appeal against a guilty verdict, a process that could take months or even longer.\n\nHis legal team would then face the Appellate Division in Manhattan, and possibly the Court of Appeals.\n\nThis all means it would be highly unlikely that Mr Trump will leave the court in handcuffs, and he would be expected to remain free on bail while he appeals.\n\nWhat would be the grounds for appeal?\n\nThe evidence of adult film star Stormy Daniels, whose alleged sexual encounter with Mr Trump is at the heart of the case, could be one reason.\n\n\"The level of detail that was provided [by Ms Daniels] is really not necessary to the telling of the story,\" said Anna Cominsky, a professor at New York Law School.\n\n\"On the one hand, her detail makes her credible and as a prosecutor, you want to provide enough detail so the jury believes what she has to say. On the other hand, there's a line, where it could become irrelevant and prejudicial.\"\n\nMr Trump's defence team twice called for a mistrial during Ms Daniels' testimony, motions that were denied by the judge.\n\nCould Trump go to prison?\n\nIt is possible, though highly unlikely, that Mr Trump would serve time behind bars in the event of a guilty verdict.\n\nThe 34 charges he faces facing are all class E felonies in New York, the lowest tier in the state. Each charge carries a maximum sentence of four years.\n\nThere are several reasons why Justice Merchan could choose a lesser punishment, including Mr Trump's age, his lack of previous convictions, and the fact that the charges involve a non-violent crime.\n\nIt is also possible that the judge would weigh the unprecedented nature of the case, perhaps choosing to avoid putting a former president and current candidate behind bars.\n\nDid prosecutors make a strong case in Trump's hush-money trial?\n\nKey players at the centre of the former president's case\n\nA guide to Donald Trump's four criminal cases\n\nThere is also a question of practicality. Mr Trump, like all former presidents, is entitled to lifelong protection from the Secret Service. This means that some agents would need to protect him in prison.\n\nEven so, it would in all likelihood be extremely difficult to run a prison system with a former president as an inmate. It would be a huge security risk and expensive to keep him safe.\n\n\"Prison systems care about two things: security of the institution and keeping costs down,\" said Justin Paperny, director of the prison consulting firm White Collar Advice.\n\nWith Mr Trump, \"it would be a freak show... no warden would allow it\", he said.\n\nCould he still run for president?\n\nYes. The US Constitution sets out relatively few eligibility requirements for presidential candidates: they must be at least 35, be a \"natural born\" US citizen and have lived in the US for at least 14 years. There are no rules blocking candidates with criminal records.\n\nBut a guilty verdict still could sway November's presidential election. A poll from Bloomberg and Morning Consult earlier this year found that 53% of voters in key swing states would refuse to vote for the Republican if he were convicted.\n\nAnother poll, from Quinnipiac University this month, showed 6% of Trump voters would be less likely to vote for him - consequential in such a tight race.\n\nCould he pardon himself?\n\nNo. Presidents can issue pardons for those who have committed federal offences. The hush-money case in New York is a state matter, meaning it would be out of Mr Trump's reach if he were to become president again.\n\nThe same is true for Mr Trump's case in Georgia, where he has been accused of criminally conspiring to overturn his narrow defeat by President Joe Biden in the state during the 2020 election. This case is currently tied up in appeals.\n\nPardon powers are unclear for Mr Trump's two federal cases - one concerning the alleged mishandling of classified documents, and the other on conspiring to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nIn the first, a Trump-appointed judge in Florida has indefinitely postponed the trial, saying setting a date before resolving questions about evidence would be \"imprudent\". The second outstanding federal case also was delayed while an appeal from Mr Trump plays out.\n\nNeither are likely to take place before the November election, but even if they did, constitutional scholars disagree on whether a president's pardon power includes himself. Mr Trump could be the first to try.\n\nWith reporting from Madeline Halpert and Kayla Epstein\n\nWho is Juan Merchan, the judge in Trump's case?\n\nTrump avoids taking the stand in hush-money

Trump's Manhattan criminal trial will enter its final stage Tuesday as defense lawyers and prosecutors deliver their closing arguments in a last attempt to sway the 12 New Yorkers who will decide his fate.\n\nFirst the defense and then the prosecution will spend hours weaving disparate strands of evidence into a cohesive story that they hope will resonate with the jurors. To mold their dueling accounts, each side can draw from a deep well of evidence: testimony from 22 witnesses, reams of emails and a surreptitious recording of Mr. Trump coordinating a secret payoff.\n\nTo persuade the jury, the prosecution and defense will begin with different versions of the same basic set of facts: Mr. Trump's fixer, Michael D. Cohen, struck a hush-money deal with a porn star in the waning days of the 2016 presidential campaign. The undisputed facts concern that $130,000 transaction; Mr. Cohen paid the porn star, Stormy Daniels, to silence her story of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump.\n\nPretty much everything else is up for debate.\n\nProsecutors have argued that Mr. Trump directed Mr. Cohen to pay Ms. Daniels and approved a criminal scheme to reimburse Mr. Cohen, disguising the repayments by saying that they were made for legal services that in fact were nonexistent. Their case is backed by the testimony of Mr. Cohen himself, as well as Ms. Daniels, several other witnesses and phone records, text messages and emails.\n\nBut the defense has cast Mr. Cohen as a liar, suggested that he acted alone in paying Ms. Daniels and argued that he was never even reimbursed for the payment.

The jury is simply supposed to enjoy it for what it is: a chance to convict Donald Trump.\n\nPollock was famous for his painting drips on large canvases. Bragg has achieved the same effect by regenerating a dead misdemeanor on falsifying business records as 34 felony counts. To achieve that extraordinary goal, he has alleged that the document violations (which expired long ago under the statute of limitations) were committed to hide some other crime.\n\nOriginally, Bragg vaguely referenced four crimes and there have been months of confusion was to what he was specifically alleging as his criminal theories. Even legal analysts on CNN and MSNBC have continued to question the specific allegations against Trump as we head into closing arguments.\n\nAs it stands, there are three crimes that have been referenced by prosecutors: state and federal election violations and taxation violations.\n\nBragg's legal vision for non-objective indictments was greatly advanced by Judge Juan Merchan, who will allow the jury to reach different rulings on what crime is actually evident in Bragg's paint splatters.\n\nMerchan has even ruled that the jurors can disagree on what actually occurred in terms of the second crime. This means there could be three groups of four jurors, with one believing that there was a conspiracy to conceal a state election violation, another believing there was a federal election violation (which Bragg cannot enforce), and a third believing there was a tax violation, respectively. Nonetheless, Merchan will treat that as a unanimous verdict.\n\nIn other words, they could look at the indictment and see vastly different shapes, but still send Trump to prison on their interpretations.\n\nMoreover, Michael Cohen is the sole witness even to address the elements of any of these crimes. Cohen is a convicted serial perjurer and disbarred attorney who appears to have lied again during the trial. Even if they consider his testimony, there is no direct corroboration in evidence on Trump's intent or knowledge. As a result, the prosecutors will rely on circumstantial evidence to support whichever interpretation the jurors will buy.\n\nFaced with charges that can mean different things to different jurors, Trump's team will have to focus on the spaces between the paint drips; the canvas itself.\n\nAll of this case is based on the payment for a non-disclosure agreement that is perfectly legal and indeed common in business and politics. The Trump team needs to stop dancing around the NDA.\n\nThe jury likely believes that Trump knew of the NDA and supported it. The defense has to emphasize the testimony of David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Inquirer, that he killed stories for a variety of celebrities and politicians, including Rahm Emmanuel and Arnold Schwarzenegger. He also said that he killed stories for Trump for years before he even thought of running for president.\n\nThey need to emphasize the testimony of multiple witnesses that Trump seemed to want to avoid embarrassment to his family. He was also the host of a popular television show and an international businessman. The payment of a couple hundred thousand to kill stories is considered a cost of doing business for most celebrities, particularly those who have television contracts with provisions allowing cancellation for scandals.\n\nIn the instructions, the court will tell the jurors that payments cannot be campaign contributions if they would have been made anyway regardless of the campaign.\n\nThey also need to point out other gaps. It was not Trump who listed payments as legal expenses or retainer payments. Witnesses said that payments to lawyers are routinely recorded as legal expenses. Indeed, it is not clear how the money should have been denominated but the decision was being made by others in the Trump organization and by Cohen himself.\n\nMoreover, on the characterization of payments as part of a \"retainer,\" the other party to that characterization was former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg. He is currently in prison in New York, but was not called by the prosecution. The prosecutors elected to rely entirely on Michael Cohen with various witnesses, including Cohen, referencing Weisselberg's decision on how to pay the money.\n\nThat made the canvas itself largely Michael Cohen. All of this is held together by a witness who admitted that he has lied to banks, Congress, prosecutors, business associates, and virtually every creature that has ever walked or crawled on the face of the Earth. He also lied in front of the jury about the critical call where he said that he told Trump about the NDA payment.\n\nThe defense showed that that 96-second-long call was to Trump's bodyguard, Keith Schiller, in late October 2016. It was preceded and followed by text messages that indicated that their conversation was actually about a teenager harassing Cohen.\n\nMoreover, Cohen admitted to making millions by bashing Trump, and that he has a personal interest in his conviction.\n\nYou can throw paint on Cohen all day, but it will not cover up the fact that he is a pathological liar and grifter.\n\nThat is why I still believe that a hung jury might even be the most likely possibility. That may change when we see Judge Merchan's final instructions. However, the only thing worse in New York than being a Trump supporter is being a chump. To rely solely on Cohen and not even call someone like Weisselberg is to play these jurors as chumps.\n\nPollock was doing more than just throwing paint at a canvas. As Pablo Picasso said, \"there is no abstract art. You must always start with something. Afterward you can remove all traces of reality.\" Bragg started with nothing and sold it as a legal abstraction.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors":

But what Trump's lawyers didn't do is provide a counternarrative, a story compelling enough to leave jurors with a reasonable doubt as to which explanation of the facts is true.\n\nProviding such a competing story isn't the defense's legal obligation, of course. The judge will instruct the jurors that if they have any reasonable doubt about the prosecution's case, they should vote to acquit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut my experience as a trial lawyer suggests a difference between freestanding doubt about one or more witnesses and a broader doubt about the rationale behind the charges -- an alternative plotline that jurors might find believable. That's the kind of defense being presented on behalf of Sen. Robert Menendez, for example, who is arguing that his wife is the guilty party.\n\nFrom the first day of testimony, the prosecution has presented a tight, persuasive tale. It begins with an August 2015 meeting involving Trump, Cohen and tabloid executive David Pecker -- who explained it to the jury from the stand -- in which the parties agreed on a scheme to smother negative stories about Trump.\n\nAnd sure enough, before the next year's election, a series of scandal-mongers required neutralizing to insulate Trump from political damage. These episodes are akin to Acts II and III of the script, falling into place along the tracks that the Pecker testimony laid.\n\nHope Hicks ' testimony was brief but powerful given her longtime loyal service to Trump and her obvious candor notwithstanding her reluctance to harm her former boss, which seemed to cause her to break into tears. She confirmed in dramatic terms that Cohen and Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization's then-chief financial officer, would not have cooked up the scheme to pay off the adult-film actor Stormy Daniels without Trump's say-so.\n\nThe prosecution effectively corroborated in advance most of what would come from its last and most important witness, Cohen. At the same time, the prosecutors encouraged their own witnesses to disparage Cohen, lowering expectations before he took the stand.\n\nWhen he did, Cohen was low-key, responsive and agreeable. With a few exceptions, he accepted the insults the defense served up, accounting for most of the discrepancies in his story by explaining that he had been telling the truth since he left the Trump fold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA couple of low points in Cohen's testimony got a lot of attention, and it's natural for the media to zero in on dramatic moments. But the jury is more likely to evaluate the evidence in the context of the whole narrative and a witness' general comportment.\n\nMost important, jurors, like all of us, make overall judgments about credibility, which is the heart and soul of the jury system. Taking the measure of the people before them, they decide whether their accounts are basically trustworthy, notwithstanding the defects of the messengers. And all the stories in this case -- not just Cohen's but those of other flawed witnesses such as Pecker and Daniels -- cohere and ring true.\n\nIt follows that the impertinence of Robert Costello, a defense witness who muttered in disagreement with Judge Juan M. Merchan's rulings, probably caught the jury's attention more than the flaws in Cohen's largely even presentation -- especially once Merchan forcefully rebuked Costello's buffoonish grandstanding.\n\nThe prosecution's cross-examination of Costello and redirect of both Cohen and Daniels were crisp, clear, textbook demolitions of the defense's points. Trump's team was more meandering and given to stray potshots, missing more than they hit.\n\nI think the defense still has one largely overlooked escape hatch: the arcane legal instructions for deciding the felony charges. The charges require the prosecution to prove that Trump caused the alleged falsification of documents to further another crime. Prosecutors have offered up three different candidates for that other crime, each of which has flaws. I could see the jury, which includes two lawyers, considering the legal instructions very carefully and finding that the district attorney came up short. And in any event, the issue is sure to figure in an appeal.\n\nBut any appeal feels a millennium away. By the time that transpires, Trump will either be president, giving him extensive options for evading accountability, or a losing candidate facing three other criminal trials. This trial looks increasingly likely to be the only opportunity for a jury to decide for the first time whether a former president is a criminal. Going into the final act, I like the chances that he will be found guilty.\n\n___\n\n\u00a92024 Los Angeles Times. Visit at latimes.com.

Here are the three options", "body": "After more than five weeks, countless hours of testimony and a mountain of documents, New York Justice Juan Merchan will soon instruct a panel of 12 New Yorkers to make a historic decision: whether Donald Trump is guilty or not guilty of felony charges.\n\nAfter both sides make their final pitches to jurors on Tuesday, Justice Juan Merchan will deliver deliberation instructions, going over each of the charges and explaining the elements of the alleged crime. While they can be technical and dry, the instructions are important guidelines for jurors' deliberations.\n\nThe former president has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records in relation to a hush-money payment made to adult-film star Stormy Daniels, who claimed she had sex with Mr Trump.\n\nOver the course of the trial, prosecutors argued that Mr Trump improperly recorded the money with which he reimbursed his former lawyer and fixer as legal expenses. They further accused him of falsifying the business records to conceal a second crime - a violation of state election law.\n\nThe defence has sought to cast doubt on testimony from the prosecution's key witness - ex-lawyer and convicted felon Michael Cohen - in an attempt to disprove the larger case.\n\nUltimately, it will be up to the jury to decide whether Mr Trump will become the first former president to be convicted of a felony.\n\nHere is what jurors could decide:\n\nAll 12 members of the jury must agree Mr Trump is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt for prosecutors to secure a conviction.\n\nThis is the worst-case scenario for Mr Trump, who would become the first major party candidate running for US president as a felon.\n\nHe would almost certainly appeal against this verdict. His lawyers already have argued for a mistrial on multiple occasions, each time unsuccessfully.\n\nIf found guilty, he faces a maximum sentence of four years behind bars, or a smaller punishment of probation and a fine. Most experts say the 77-year-old is unlikely to face any time in prison.\n\n\"It is a non-violent offence. It's the lowest of the [felony] offences,\" said former Brooklyn prosecutor Julie Rendelman. \"With no record, his age, you name it, it would be highly unlikely.\"\n\nIf Mr Trump was sentenced to time in prison, it would pose a logistical challenge for court officers and Secret Service staff who would be required to protect him in prison.\n\nIf all 12 members of the jury find prosecutors have not proven Mr Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, he would be acquitted of the felony charges, which would be a major blow to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office that brought the case.\n\nIt only takes one of the 12 jurors to unravel the prosecutors' case.\n\nIf the jurors cannot all agree unanimously on a verdict - guilty or not guilty - this will result in a hung jury.\n\nIf they report to the judge that they cannot reach a decision, Justice Merchan may instruct them once or twice more to try again to reach a verdict.\n\nBut if they still cannot, he would declare a mistrial.

Jurors will then undertake the unprecedented task of deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of felony criminal charges stemming from hush money payments tied to an alleged scheme to buy and bury stories that might wreck Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nAt the heart of the charges are reimbursements paid to Michael Cohen for a $130,000 hush money payment that was paid to porn actor Stormy Daniels in exchange for not going public with her claim about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nProsecutors say the payments to Cohen, Trump's then-lawyer, were falsely logged as \"legal expenses\" to hide the true nature of the transactions.\n\nTrump has denied all wrongdoing.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records, charges which are punishable by up to four years in prison.\n\nClosing arguments are expected to last all day Tuesday, with jury deliberations beginning as soon as Wednesday.\n\nFollow along for live updates:\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThey'll instead function as hours-long recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics.\n\nTheir task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime.\n\nAny verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nThe indictment against Trump centers on payoffs allegedly made to two women, porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump's former lawyer and \"fixer,\" Michael Cohen, paid Daniels $130,000 and arranged for the publisher of the National Enquirer supermarket tabloid to pay McDougal $150,000.\n\nTrump's company, the Trump Organization, then reimbursed Cohen and paid him bonuses and extra payments - all of which, prosecutors say, were falsely logged as legal expenses in company records. Over several months, Cohen said the company paid him $420,000.\n\nPayments were also allegedly made to a Trump Tower doorman who claimed to have a story about a child he alleged Trump had out of wedlock.\n\nThe indictment, brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, made Trump the first ex-president ever to face criminal charges.\n\nTrump has denied the accusations.\n\nAfter being forced to release a seated juror, the judge ordered the media not to report on where potential jurors have worked - even when stated in open court - and to be careful about revealing information about those who would sit in judgment of the former president. Here's what we can report.\n\nJuror 1 and foreperson: A man who lives in New York City and has no children. Loves the outdoors and gets his news from The New York Times, Daily Mail, Fox News and MSNBC.\n\nWhen asked by Trump defense attorney Todd Blanche if he was aware Trump is charged in other cases and jurisdictions, and how that affects him, the man said, \"I don't have an opinion.\"\n\nJuror 2: A man who said he follows Trump's former lawyer, Cohen, on \"X,\" formerly known as Twitter. He also revealed he follows other right-wing accounts including Trump's former adviser, Kellyanne Conway.\n\nHe has said he would unfollow Cohen as he may be a witness in the trial.\n\nJuror 3: A middle-aged man who lives in Manhattan. He grew up in Oregon. He gets his news from The New York Times and Google.\n\nJuror 4: A man who lived in New York City for 15 years. He is originally from California. He is married with three children and a wife who is a teacher. He has served on a jury before - both on a grand jury and a jury in a criminal trial.\n\nThe juror said he gets his news from \"a smattering\" of sources and does not use social media.\n\nJuror 6: A young woman who lives in Manhattan and likes to dance.\n\nJuror 7: A man who is married with two children.\n\nHe gets most of his news from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and The Washington Post. The man has said he is aware there are other lawsuits but said, \"I'm not sure that I know anyone's character.\"\n\nJuror 8: No information has been released about this juror.\n\nJuror 9: A woman who lives in Manhattan. She is not married and has no children.\n\nShe has never served on a jury before and does not watch the news. However, she said she does have email subscriptions to CNN and The New York Times. She follows social media accounts and listens to podcasts. She also enjoys watching reality TV.\n\nJuror 10: A man who lives in Manhattan. He is not married and has no children. He does have a roommate who works in accounting. He rarely follows the news but he does listen to podcasts on behavioral psychology.\n\nJuror 11: No information has been released about this juror.\n\nJuror 12: No information has been released about this juror.\n\nThe trial is not being televised. Instead, news reporters and producers will have the ability to sit inside the courtroom and deliver information to the public.\n\nAs of this report, Trump is currently involved in four criminal cases, which includes the hush money case.\n\nA second case out of Fulton County, Georgia, has charged Trump, as well as 18 others, with participating in a scheme to illegally attempt to overturn the former president's loss to President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nTrump is also involved in a third criminal case in Washington, D.C., which charged him with allegedly conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the run-up to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAnd his fourth case involves classified documents that Trump illegally retained at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left the White House.\n\nRELATED: A guide to Trump's court cases", "source": {"uri": "fox5dc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 DC"}, "authors": [],

But will jurors buy his story?\n\nNo single person was closer to Mr Trump's alleged scheme to corruptly influence the 2016 presidential election than his one-time \"fixer,\" who abandoned his position as the pugilistic \"consigliere\" for a more civic-minded -- and lucrative -- role as Mr Trump's chief antagonist.\n\nCohen openly loathes Mr Trump. He at least partially blames him for his prison sentence for crimes tied to the New York case. He admitted in court to calling Mr Trump a \"boorish cartoon misogynist\" and \"Cheeto-dusted\" villain. Jurors heard clips from Cohen's podcast screaming that \"revenge is a dish best served cold.\"\n\nDefense attorneys depicted Cohen as a disgruntled, selfish and fame-hungry opportunist. He was furious with a lower-than-usual bonus check, so he stole from Mr Trump's company, and then flipped against him when federal prosecutors snooped around his home and office, eventually turning the newfound attention into a multimillion-dollar business that revolves around trashing his old boss.\n\nBut on the witness stand in the Republican presidential nominee's criminal trial in Manhattan, Cohen -- his eyes wide and sunken, his hair graying and his Long Island accent softened -- admitted to and directly confronted his history of lies, convictions and shameful behavior that compromised his freedom and family.\n\nOver four days, he walked jurors through dozens of pieces of evidence, including the allegedly falsified business records that relate to each of the 34 counts against Mr Trump -- and that have Cohen's name stamped all over them.\n\nIn his testimony, Mr Trump's former attorney explained that his boss told him to \"handle\" hush money payments and nondisclosure agreements that would keep his campaign-crushing sex scandals out of the press before Election Day in 2016.\n\nWhen it came to covering up an adult film star's story about her alleged sexual encounter with Mr Trump for $130,000, Mr Trump allegedly told Cohen: \"Just do it.\"\n\nLess than two weeks before Election Day, Cohen finalized a contract and wired her attorney the cash. Then, he told Mr Trump that the deal was done. A satisfied president-elect Trump then approved a payment plan to reimburse his attorney before heading to Washington DC, where he signed the checks from the Oval Office, Cohen said.\n\n\"What I was doing,\" Cohen testified, \"was at the direction of and benefit of Mr Trump.\"\n\nHis entire life \"has been turned upside down as a direct result,\" he said during his final moments on the witness stand. \"I lost my law licenses, my business, my financial security ... My family's happiness is paramount.\"\n\nCohen's testimony was corroborated with 11 signed checks -- most of which include Mr Trump's Sharpie-inked signature -- stapled to Cohen's invoices, and 12 ledger entries that mark Cohen's payments as a \"legal expense\" pursuant to a \"retainer\" that even Mr Trump's defense attorneys admit never existed. Prosecutors used emails, text messages, call logs, encrypted chats and even surreptitiously recorded conversations with Mr Trump himself to carefully lay out the scheme.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche repeatedly reminded Cohen of his past praise for the former president -- how he admired him \"tremendously,\" called The Art of the Deal a \"masterpiece,\" and insisted he'd take a bullet for him.\n\n\"At the time, you weren't lying, right?\" Mr Blanche asked him.\n\n\"At that time, I was knee-deep into the cult of Donald Trump, yes,\" Cohen said.\n\n\"I was not lying,\" he added. \"It's how I felt.\"\n\nWhen jurors begin deliberations this month, they don't have to believe all the details of Cohen's life story. His past lies and shady behavior don't make the evidence against Mr Trump any less admissible.\n\nCohen's testimony gave jurors the connective tissue for the prosecution's narrative: Mr Trump warned Cohen to \"be prepared\" for stories about women when he launched his 2016 campaign, instructed him to pay them off, then signed the checks that reimbursed him, all as part of a plan drawn up by his accountants and finalized from the White House.\n\nBut the now-disbarred attorney has been keenly aware of the power of the information in his possession and has admitted to using it to his advantage.\n\nDuring the first day of cross-examination, he admitted that he asked about the benefits of meeting with Manhattan prosecutors about this case while he was locked up in federal prison.\n\nHe also admitted that he has a financial interest in the outcome of the case -- not necessarily if he's convicted, but because Mr Trump is a constant source of subject matter for his podcasts and TikTok account.\n\nIt would actually be better if Mr Trump is not convicted, he said, \"because it gives me more to talk about in the future.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk",

It was then zapped back into life in the form of roughly three dozen felonies by claiming that bookkeeping violations -- allegedly hiding payments to Stormy Daniels to ensure her silence about a supposed affair with Trump -- were committed to hide another crime.\n\nBut what is that second crime?\n\nEven liberal legal analysts admitted that they could not figure out what was being alleged in Bragg's indictment. Now, after weeks of trial, the situation has changed little.\n\nOriginally, Bragg referenced four possible crimes, though is now claiming three: a tax violation or either a state or federal campaign financing violation. The last crime is particularly controversial because Bragg has no authority to enforce federal law and the Justice Department declined any criminal charge. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) did not even find grounds for a civil fine.\n\nJudge Merchan has ruled that the jury does not have to agree on what that crime is. The jury could split into three groups of four on which of the three crimes were being concealed and Merchan will still treat it as a unanimous verdict.\n\nThe jury has been given little substantive information on these crimes, and Merchan has denied a legal expert who could have shown that there was no federal election violation.\n\nThis case should have been dismissed for lack of evidence or a cognizable crime. The jury will be reminded that the burden is on the government, not the defense.\n\nHowever, the presumption of innocence is often hard to discern in criminal cases. Most jurors believe that clients are sitting behind the defense table for a reason. That is why many prosecution offices have conviction rates in the 80%-90% range.\n\nThat presumption is even more difficult to discern when the defendant is named Trump and the jury sits in Manhattan.\n\nA classic closing pitch by lawyers is to use a physical object like a three-legged stool. If any leg is missing, the stool collapses.\n\nIn this case, the government needs to show that there was a falsification of business records, that the records were falsified to conceal another crime and that Donald Trump had the specific intent to use such \"unlawful means\" to influence the election.\n\nEven a cursory review of the evidence shows this case does not have a leg to stand on.\n\nThe dead misdemeanor that is the foundation for this entire prosecution requires the falsification of business records. It is not clear that there was such falsification or that Trump has any knowledge or role in any falsification.\n\nWitnesses testified that Trump would sign checks prepared by others and that the specific checks in this case were signed while Trump was serving as president. Some of these checks, labeled \"legal expenses,\" were allegedly for attorney Michael Cohen to pay off Stormy Daniels.\n\nMost importantly, Jeffrey McConney, the Trump Organization's retired controller and senior vice-president, testified that it was not Trump who designated these payments as \"legal expenses.\" Rather, the corporation used an \"antiquated\" drop-down menu where any payments to lawyers were designated \"legal expenses.\" There is a plausible reason why payments to an attorney were listed as legal expenses.\n\nThe government also cites the designation of payments to Cohen as part of his \"retainer,\" which included reimbursement for the payment of the Daniels non-disclosure agreement. However, that designation was the result of discussions between Cohen and former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg, who is sitting in a jail cell in New York City. The government could have called Weisselberg, but did not.\n\nThe government has made a big deal over the fact that retainer agreements are supposed to have written contracts. However, that was the failure of Cohen, who was later disbarred as an attorney.\n\nFor a businessman like Weisselberg, monthly payments to an attorney could have seemed perfectly logical. Once again, there was no evidence that Trump knew of how the payments were denoted.\n\nThe government must also show that any falsification was done to further or conceal another crime.\n\nThis is where the defense needs to bring greater clarity to its own narrative. Trump's team needs to drive home that a non-disclosure agreement is common in political, business and entertainment circles. The payment of money to quash a story before an election is neither unlawful nor unusual.\n\nIndeed, Keith Davidson, Stormy Daniels' attorney, described the NDA as routine and said that it was not hush money but a simple contractual transaction: \"It wasn't a payoff. It wasn't hush money. It was consideration.\"\n\nThis is where the testimony of David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Inquirer, was particularly damaging to the government.\n\nPecker detailed how killing such stories was a common practice at the National Inquirer and that he had done so for Trump for over a decade before he ran for president. He also killed stories for an impressive list of other celebrities, including Tiger Woods, Mark Wahlberg, Rahm Emanuel and Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nMechan has allowed the jury to repeatedly hear of \"election violations,\" while blocking a legal expert to explain that there is no federal election law violation. The payment of hush money is not a campaign contribution and, again, the federal government not only declined to bring any criminal charge, but found no basis for even a civil fine.\n\nHad he been allowed to testify, Bradley Smith, the former Federal Election Commission (FEC) chairman, would have explained that, even if it were a campaign contribution, it would not have been needed to be filed until after the election -- demolishing the notion that this was an effort to influence an election that would have run before any filing had to be made.\n\nThe defense has to hammer away on the fact that no one has testified that it was a federal campaign violation.\n\nVarious witnesses, including former Trump aide Hope Hicks, testified that Trump was motivated to protect his family from embarrassment. She recounted how Trump even \"wanted me to make sure the newspapers weren't delivered to their residence that morning.\"\n\nPecker testified that he previously killed stories about Trump going back over a decade. That included stories that were demonstrably untrue, such as a claim of a doorman that he fathered a child out of wedlock.\n\nIn addition to being a married man, Trump was the host of a major television program subject to a scandal clause. He was also an international businessman. Given all of those interests, it is impossible to claim absolutely that the campaign was the reason for the NDA, which was chump change for a billionaire.\n\nThe government spent considerable time proving facts not in dispute. There is no dispute that there was a NDA or that Trump signed checks on these payments. It is like repeatedly telling a court that a driver drove 55 miles an hour down a highway and elected to change lanes with a signal. The intent is to convince the jury that somehow proving that an NDA was paid and that an affair occurred is proof of an offense. It is not.\n\nThe supervisor in charge of processing payments said that permission to cut Cohen's checks came not from Trump, but from Weisselberg and McConney. Trump's White House secretary, Madeleine Westerhout, testified that it was common for Trump to sign checks in the White House without reviewing them.\n\nThe entire basis for the alleged criminal intent is Michael Cohen, a disbarred lawyer and serial perjurer.\n\nYet even Cohen did not offer a clear basis for showing a criminal intent to use unlawful means to influence the election.\n\nEverything Cohen described could be true and only show a desire to kill an embarrassing story before an election -- again, not a crime.\n\nCohen described the mechanics on the payments, but the only person who discussed these payments in detail with Cohen was Weisselberg.\n\nEven liberal experts on CNN admitted that Cohen was trashed on the stand. The only crime that was clearly established in his trial was the grand larceny that Cohen admitted to under oath (after the statute of limitations had run out). Cohen said that he stole tens of thousands from the Trump corporation, a crime far more serious than the dead misdemeanor or even the felonies alleged against Trump.\n\nHowever, the most significant testimony by Cohen may be his latest alleged perjury in front of the jury.\n\nMany of us guffawed when Cohen claimed that he secretly taped Trump to protect him and keep Pecker honest. No one can explain how that could possibly be true. If it were, he would have told Trump. There is nothing in the call that would have any impact on Pecker, and Cohen admitted to regularly taping others without telling them.\n\nAnother alleged perjury came with the key telephone call in which Cohen claimed Trump was informed that the Daniels deal was concluded. The defense showed that that 96-second-long call was to Trump's bodyguard, Keith Schiller, in late October 2016. It was preceded and followed by text messages that clearly shows that the conversation was about a teenager harassing Cohen, not the NDA.\n\nOther witnesses trashed Cohen as unprofessional, prone to exaggeration, bitter against Trump, at times suicidal over being denied positions like attorney general and simply \"a jerk.\" Hope Hicks, a former aide to Trump, said that Cohen \"used to like to call himself Mister Fix It, but it was only because he first broke it.\"\n\nThose were the government's witnesses.\n\nCohen's lack of credibility and his admitted financial interest in attacking Trump only highlight again the absence of Weisselberg, whom Cohen references repeatedly as the key person making decisions on how these payments were made and described.\n\nIf what Cohen said was true, corroboration was sitting a car ride away in Rikers Island. Traffic may be bad but it is not that bad. The only reason not to call Weisselberg was that he would contradict Cohen.\n\nThe prosecution preferred to use a serial perjurer who roughly half of the country views as dishonest as almost the entirety of their case. Even beyond Weisselberg, there is no corroboration for Cohen's vague allegations on the record.\n\nIn the end, this three-legged stool is the very thing that all of us must stand on when accused. Who on the jury would want to stand on this stool with their own liberty at stake?\n\nIn the end, the defense needs to be honest with these jurors. The question is whether hatred for this man is enough to ignore the obvious injustice in this case. They may have come to this case with little doubt about Donald Trump, but the question is whether there is not any reasonable doubt about the crimes alleged against him.\n\nIn the end, we are all standing on that wobbly stool when the government seeks to convict people without evidence or even a clear crime. If we allow a conviction, it is more than a stool that will collapse in this Manhattan courtroom.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [],

Donald J. Trump.\n\nAfter closing arguments in Manhattan today, the jury will start its deliberations Wednesday on the 34 criminal counts against the former president. More than a year after his indictment and arraignment and following a six-week trial, Trump will probably have to wait only a couple of more days before he hears from the jury.\n\nFriday afternoons get more than their fair share of verdicts, as jurors tend to find consensus more readily when they're missing out on weekends, not time on their jobs.\n\nHe could get a hung jury, sure. But getting to a mistrial takes a lot longer. In my years covering the courts, especially in high profile cases, judges do not yield lightly to a foreperson's claims of impasse. As hard and as long as the lawyers in this case have worked to empanel a jury for the most famous man in the world and present the complicated evidence, Judge Juan Merchan would surely make the members of the panel stew for some time before he released them.\n\nThat's how you get to a partial conviction. The holdouts agree to vote \"guilty\" on some of the charges in exchange for \"not guilty\" votes on the rest. Each of the 34 counts relates to a specific document prosecutors say was falsified by Trump or at his behest. They could, for instance, reject the charges based on actions by former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen but still convict on Trump ledger entries or checks.\n\nI have been uniformly impressed by the seriousness with which jury members take their jobs in every case I covered, but also noted their willingness to get to a deal. And here, while the political implications are significant, the penalties are light. Even a conviction on the full boat of charges would probably mean only a couple of months in prison, and quite possibly just probation, for an elderly defendant with no prior criminal record. The stakes feel high based on press coverage, but as a matter of crime and punishment, no one's life is on the line. A good foreperson might understand, ahem, the art of the deal.\n\nI don't know how the betting odds on a Trump conviction have been running, but it would hardly be a long shot for him to be found guilty. This is Manhattan, in a county where Trump got 12 percent of the vote four years ago. He's behaved boorishly throughout the proceedings and attacked a process that by now, jurors probably feel pretty proud to be a part of, even if they're ready to go home.\n\nBut the question the world has really been asking isn't about the disposition of the case, but the disposition of the electorate about it. The most recent Marquette University Law School poll in key battleground Wisconsin suggests a logical conclusion by voters: Without a conviction, Trump led President Joe Biden by a robust 6 points. With a conviction, Biden led by 4 points.\n\nThe way Marquette did the poll was to break the respondents into two groups: half were asked about their vote if Trump was found guilty, the other half if he was found not guilty. In both groups, the share of respondents saying they would vote third party or not vote was the same at 18 percent. With a conviction, Trump went from 44 percent to 39 percent, while Biden went from 38 percent if Trump were found not guilty to 43 percent if Trump is found guilty.\n\nThat 10-point swing tells us that there is a significant chunk of the electorate that would actually switch its vote based on a conviction, or at least they think right now that it would.\n\nBut let's imagine on a mild and sunny afternoon this Friday, Trump gets popped. Guilty, guilty, guilty. Then what? It's not like he's going to be led through the sally port in handcuffs and taken to Rikers Island. In any case, sentencing would take months, and in this case there would surely be a mountain of appeals. If he is convicted, it might be years before Trump is sentenced, even if he doesn't win in November.\n\nSo Trump would be a felon ... probably maybe. Having evidently delayed the trials on the other, more serious charges against him until after the election, this seedy case will stand alone in the court of public opinion. Even many of Trump's harshest critics have acknowledged that it was quite a bit of bootstrapping by an ambitious district attorney, so the Republicans would have a pretty easy time spinning the verdict.\n\n\"We've seen this judge reversed before, and we are going to see it again here,\" they will tell us. And as the news media dives into the particulars of New York appellate law and the nature of pre-sentencing bonds, it will start to feel like a fizzle.\n\nThat's probably exactly what Republicans should be hoping for: a conviction followed by a question mark.\n\nOne of the ways that the trial has most benefited Trump is that it has kept him busy and scared. Whatever Trump says about the judge and his gag order, this trial has consumed the former president's attention. If he's going to act crazy, better for Republicans that he act crazy about his personal problems rather than politics and policy.\n\nImagine how much more his administration could have done if Trump had been consumed in court cases rather than blundering into policy questions via pre-dawn tweets and impromptu press conferences.\n\nWith months to turn the case into a muddle to the public and Trump walking around free on appeal, a conviction wouldn't be so bad for his chances. It's not that it would help, it's just a harm that could be mitigated and come with some ancillary benefits in the way of offering some check on Trump's bad behavior.\n\nWhat Republicans should worry much more about is a Trump acquittal. Beyond the reach of the judge and jury and primed for revenge, an emboldened Trump would be hell on wheels. Ahead in the polls and having beaten the rap, Trump would come careening into the general election, as always, his own worst enemy.\n\nTrump won the presidency in 2016 in substantial part because of the Access Hollywood scandal. The tape of Trump bragging about grabbing women's genitals and forcing them to kiss him came out exactly one month before the election. It sent his numbers through the floor, but it also made him afraid enough of a humiliating landslide defeat that he became willing to behave just a little better, to be just a little more disciplined in his messaging, to be just a little more normal.\n\nWhen then-FBI Director James Comey dropped the Anthony Weiner laptop story into the campaign narrative 11 days before the election, Trump had already been running scared for three weeks. His relative discipline had left the space clear for a story that, until it was debunked, seemed to reaffirm all the worst suspicions persuadable voters had about the sneaky, sleazy Clintons.\n\nAmericans have forgotten a lot of the exhaustion they felt about Trump and his antics, his cruelty, and his chaos. A post-acquittal Trump who is ready to settle scores and take no heed of warnings to behave himself would remind voters only too well why they got rid of him in the first place.\n\nIt's never good to have a nominee who Americans think is a crook and a lout, but it's even worse to have one who doesn't know that they see him that way.\n\nRead more at The Dispatch", "source": {"uri": "fresnobee.com",

Jurors will then undertake the unprecedented task of deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of felony criminal charges stemming from hush money payments tied to an alleged scheme to buy and bury stories that might wreck Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nAt the heart of the charges are reimbursements paid to Michael Cohen for a $130,000 hush money payment that was paid to porn actor Stormy Daniels in exchange for not going public with her claim about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nProsecutors say the payments to Cohen, Trump's then-lawyer, were falsely logged as \"legal expenses\" to hide the true nature of the transactions.\n\nTrump has denied all wrongdoing.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records, charges which are punishable by up to four years in prison.\n\nClosing arguments are expected to last all day Tuesday, with jury deliberations beginning as soon as Wednesday.\n\nFollow along for live updates:\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime.\n\nAny verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nThe indictment against Trump centers on payoffs allegedly made to two women, porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump's former lawyer and \"fixer,\" Michael Cohen, paid Daniels $130,000 and arranged for the publisher of the National Enquirer supermarket tabloid to pay McDougal $150,000.\n\nTrump's company, the Trump Organization, then reimbursed Cohen and paid him bonuses and extra payments - all of which, prosecutors say, were falsely logged as legal expenses in company records. Over several months, Cohen said the company paid him $420,000.\n\nPayments were also allegedly made to a Trump Tower doorman who claimed to have a story about a child he alleged Trump had out of wedlock.\n\nThe indictment, brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, made Trump the first ex-president ever to face criminal charges.\n\nTrump has denied the accusations.\n\nAfter being forced to release a seated juror, the judge ordered the media not to report on where potential jurors have worked - even when stated in open court - and to be careful about revealing information about those who would sit in judgment of the former president. Here's what we can report.\n\nJuror 1 and foreperson: A man who lives in New York City and has no children. Loves the outdoors and gets his news from The New York Times, Daily Mail, Fox News and MSNBC.\n\nWhen asked by Trump defense attorney Todd Blanche if he was aware Trump is charged in other cases and jurisdictions, and how that affects him, the man said, \"I don't have an opinion.\"\n\nJuror 2: A man who said he follows Trump's former lawyer, Cohen, on \"X,\" formerly known as Twitter. He also revealed he follows other right-wing accounts including Trump's former adviser, Kellyanne Conway.\n\nHe has said he would unfollow Cohen as he may be a witness in the trial.\n\nJuror 3: A middle-aged man who lives in Manhattan. He grew up in Oregon. He gets his news from The New York Times and Google.\n\nJuror 4: A man who lived in New York City for 15 years. He is originally from California. He is married with three children and a wife who is a teacher. He has served on a jury before - both on a grand jury and a jury in a criminal trial.\n\nThe juror said he gets his news from \"a smattering\" of sources and does not use social media.\n\nJuror 6: A young woman who lives in Manhattan and likes to dance.\n\nJuror 7: A man who is married with two children.\n\nHe gets most of his news from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and The Washington Post. The man has said he is aware there are other lawsuits but said, \"I'm not sure that I know anyone's character.\"\n\nJuror 8: No information has been released about this juror.\n\nJuror 9: A woman who lives in Manhattan. She is not married and has no children.\n\nShe has never served on a jury before and does not watch the news. However, she said she does have email subscriptions to CNN and The New York Times. She follows social media accounts and listens to podcasts. She also enjoys watching reality TV.\n\nJuror 10: A man who lives in Manhattan. He is not married and has no children. He does have a roommate who works in accounting. He rarely follows the news but he does listen to podcasts on behavioral psychology.\n\nJuror 11: No information has been released about this juror.\n\nJuror 12: No information has been released about this juror.\n\nThe trial is not being televised. Instead, news reporters and producers will have the ability to sit inside the courtroom and deliver information to the public.\n\nAs of this report, Trump is currently involved in four criminal cases, which includes the hush money case.\n\nA second case out of Fulton County, Georgia, has charged Trump, as well as 18 others, with participating in a scheme to illegally attempt to overturn the former president's loss to President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nTrump is also involved in a third criminal case in Washington, D.C., which charged him with allegedly conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the run-up to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAnd his fourth case involves classified documents that Trump illegally retained at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left the White House.\n\nRELATED: A guide to Trump's court cases", "source": {"uri": "fox5atlanta.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 Atlanta"}, "authors": [],

(Mark Peterson/Pool/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's trial in New York is nearing an end. On May 28, the prosecution and defense will sum up their cases, allowing jurors to deliberate on their verdict.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney has charged President Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records to the first degree, to which he has pleaded not guilty.\n\nAfter the day-long summations, New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan will give jurors instructions on the law, which should last an hour.\n\nBoth sides have reminded jurors that this case is about falsified business records, and prosecutors are expected to emphasize the volume of records they have entered into evidence.\n\nThroughout the trial, prosecutors have shown emails, texts, phone call logs, contracts, and other documentation in efforts to establish that there was a scheme in place to influence the 2016 presidential election, and an effort to conceal it in the creation of 11 payments to ex-lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\nThey have argued that the records speak for themselves and are evidence of intent to defraud.\n\nHowever, the records are of mixed relevance. Some were directly related to the $420,000 payment to Mr. Cohen, while others included text conversations unrelated to the events of the case, or even book excerpts from old Trump books on business advice.\n\nNot all records were entered into evidence for the truth of their content; many had also been entered to aid jurors in assessing the credibility of witnesses.\n\nProsecutors will also likely remind jurors of the concept of accessorial liability, though the judge will read an official definition of the terms to the jury before deliberation.\n\nDuring jury selection, prosecutors had used the example of a man hiring a hitman which seemed to annoy the defense, arguing that the man would be guilty even though he had not pulled the trigger.\n\nThey may remind jurors that the prosecutors needed to show that President Trump caused false records to be created, but not that he created them himself.\n\nThey also needed to show that President Trump had the intent to conceal a scheme. However, the jury does not need to unanimously agree on the elements of the scheme. The judge may instruct prosecutors to limit explanations of the law, leaving that to the judge.\n\nThe defense only called two witnesses briefly, allowing attorney Robert Costello to refute claims Mr. Cohen made about his character, and call logs between Mr. Costello and Mr. Cohen to be entered into evidence.\n\nThe rest of the 22 witnesses were called by prosecutors, largely to enter records into evidence, except for a few who gave lengthy, narrative testimonies, during which defense attorneys seized upon inconsistencies.\n\nStephanie Clifford, better known as adult performer Stormy Daniels, and Mr. Cohen are considered to be at the center of the case because the 34 business records comprising the charges are only falsified if it is found that they were created to cover up a scheme necessitating this payment.\n\nHowever, both witnesses were at times argumentative and evasive on the stand, gave inconsistent details, and acknowledged their animosity toward President Trump and financial interest in criticizing him publicly. Defense attorneys are likely to cast them both as opportunists.\n\nPresident Trump has denied an alleged sexual encounter with Ms. Clifford, and the defense pointed out during cross-examination of Ms. Clifford that she told different accounts of the alleged encounter at different times, and suggested her inconsistent claims about why she came out with her story showed motivation to extort.\n\nThe defense attorneys have argued that Mr. Cohen is a liar, pointing to his track record of lying under oath and possibly to his new admission of stealing at least $30,000 from the Trump Organization by requesting more than he was owed for a payment he made to Red Finch for polling services.\n\nTwo other witnesses gave longer testimonies, but much of it had been to provide context for an alleged scheme.\n\nDavid Pecker, former head of American Media Inc., testified for a week about stories he bought to suppress because he believed they would harm the Trump campaign. However, neither of those stories was related to the charges.\n\nKeith Davidson, attorney for Ms. Clifford, testified at length, offering color and context to the agreement Mr. Cohen entered into with Ms. Clifford. Mr. Davidson made it clear on the witness stand that the non-disclosure agreement they signed was a completely legal contract, something defense attorneys are likely to remind jurors.\n\nDefense attorneys will also be restricted from explaining the law to jurors, but they are likely to remind the jury that the non-disclosure agreement, popularly termed \"hush money\" by prosecutors, is completely legal, as is influencing an election through lawful means.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Jurors will be tasked with deciding whether prosecutors have proven Trump guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. At the heart of this decision will be their assessment of the credibility of star witness Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and self-described fixer.\n\nBy his own admission during the trial, Cohen lied, cheated and stole, including from the TrumpOrganization. This may seem like a problem for the prosecution. However, in my experience, it is quite the opposite. The very fact that Cohen himself admitted to his prior lies and criminal activities could very well lead the jury to credit his testimony and use it to convict Trump.\n\nIn my 30 years as a prosecutor, I have dealt with countless cooperating witnesses, CWs for short. This term most accurately describes defendants who plead guilty to their crimes and enter into a cooperative agreement with prosecutors to testify fully, truthfully, and accurately about the crimes of others. In exchange, the cooperating witness receives a reduced plea or a more lenient sentence.\n\nAs former felons, cooperating witnesses usually have a lot of baggage.\n\nAs part of the agreement, the cooperating witness must also admit and be willing to testify about crimes he himself committed. This standard practice is essential to enhance the credibility of witnesses. You cannot expect a jury to believe testimony about another person's crimes if the cooperating witness is unable or unwilling to confess to his or her own crimes.\n\nCohen is what I would call a de facto cooperating witness. He pleaded guilty to his crimes and agreed to testify against Trump, but without entering into a formal cooperation agreement with prosecutors.\n\nCohen may be a deeply flawed individual and someone who is all too willing to commit crimes for his boss and for his own financial gain. But he's also a typical cooperating witness: someone perfectly positioned to expose to the jury the crimes of the biggest fish in the corrupt scheme.\n\nA conspiracy is a secret agreement between two or more people to commit crimes. By their very nature, these criminal agreements are intended to hide the conspiracy from public view. That's why prosecutors work to assemble an internal as a co-conspirator and develop that person as a cooperating witness who can authoritatively inform jurors about what was happening within the conspiracy.\n\nBut as former felons, cooperating witnesses usually have a lot of baggage. Which brings us back to Cohen.\n\nIn many ways, Cohen was a near-perfect cooperative witness. He was in direct communication with the biggest criminal fish. He even had a secret audio recording that helped prove Trump was involved in a corrupt scheme to hide damaging information for political purposes. Cohen testified that he committed crimes at Trump's direction and, importantly, for Trump's benefit.\n\nThe fact that the crimes Trump indisputably benefited from was him, not Cohen, who ran for (and ultimately won) elected office will not escape the jury. Indeed, even if Cohen could have hoped to benefit from Trump's help in the future, these crimes undoubtedly caused Cohen immediate harm. He had to take out a home equity line of credit just to come up with the $130,000 payment.\n\nCohen spent more than 20 hours on the witness stand, seemingly without becoming angry, belligerent or losing his temper. The same cannot be said of the defense's only important witness, Robert Costello. Although Costello was a lawyer himself, he was more than belligerent and Judge Juan Merchan at one point allowed the courtroom to reprimand Costello for his contemptuous behavior. The jury undoubtedly noted the dramatic contrast between Cohen's performance and Costello's.\n\nTwo points in Cohen's testimony have been portrayed in the media as deeply damaging to his credibility: that he may have confused the date of the precise phone call in which he told Trump that he had made the secret payment, and the fact that Cohen stole $30,000 from the Trump Organization.\n\nThe prosecution did not choose Cohen as a witness. Trump chose him as a witness when he allegedly enlisted him in his corruption scheme.\n\nThis old prosecutor saw these two extracts from Cohen's testimony very differently. If I pursued this case, I would address the phone call in my rebuttal and not in my opening argument, after the defense undoubtedly addressed it in its closing argument. Next, I asked the jurors if they specifically remembered the date and time of telephone conversations from eight years ago. The question answers itself. So whether Cohen told Trump on a call on a Wednesday or a Thursday doesn't matter.\n\nMore importantly, does anyone believe that Trump would have started sending Cohen a series of $35,000 checks from his personal bank account if Cohen had not told Trump that the payment had been made ? Please!\n\nThe second revelation that Cohen stole $30,000 from Trump is a perceived weakness that I would turn into a strength. In closing arguments, defense attorneys often fall into the trap of leading the jury not to believe the testimony of a cooperating witness that incriminates their client, but to believe the same testimony when it incriminates the witness.\n\nThe defense attorney will likely tell the jury, \"You cannot credit Cohen's testimony because he is a thief, having stolen from the very person he, as a lawyer, was supposed to zealously represent.\"\n\nThis argument has a certain superficial appeal. But I would refute it this way:\n\nLadies and gentlemen, who proved to you that Michael Cohen stole $30,000 from the Trump Organization? It was Michael Cohen himself, in his sworn testimony! And here's the important part of Cohen's testimony about his theft that was uncorroborated. No other witnesses came here to testify about this. No audio recording exposes it. No commercial records confirmed this.\n\nSo the defense is asking you to credit Michael Cohen's uncorroborated testimony when he tells you he stole $30,000 from Trump. Yet when Cohen's testimony is corroborated by other witnesses through audio recordings, telephone recordings, business ledger entries, and checks signed by Trump falsely claiming to be reimbursement for legal services, then Cohen is corroborated in eight ways until Sunday, the defense urges you not to believe his testimony?\n\nTo be clear, the defense wants you to credit Cohen's uncorroborated account of his own misconduct, but don't believe Cohen's fully corroborated testimony if it hurts Trump. Ladies and gentlemen, the defense has just invited you to break down and change. But we know you won't.\n\nI would close by reminding the jury that the prosecution did not choose Cohen as a witness. Trump chose him as a witness when he allegedly enlisted him in his corrupt scheme to pay money and falsify business records to gain an unfair advantage in a presidential election. Cohen may have lied, cheated and stolen, but he also testified about what he did as Trump's co-conspirator, his accomplice in crime. And soon, a jury will have to decide whether this testimony, as well as the significant evidence that corroborates it, is consistent with reality. enough to prove Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_state's_evidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turn state's evidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cooperative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_boss", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crime boss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_equity_line_of_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home equity line of credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtroom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Courtroom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telephone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-05/240514-Michael-Cohen-ch-1619-e38889.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Closing arguments come Tuesday, and a verdict could come as soon as next week. So at this moment, we want to take a minute to remind you who the main characters are, what the main plot points are and how they may all come up in closing arguments.\n\nFor the prosecution, it could be National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, who testified about the catch-and-kill scheme that he allegedly carried out with Trump and Trump's lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen. The prosecution will also likely remind the jury of Stormy Daniels' detailed description of the alleged sexual encounter she had with Trump in 2006. And finally, they'll likely emphasize to the jury the heart of Cohen's testimony - that Trump knowingly committed fraud to conceal Daniels' claims of an affair, details that he feared could tank his 2016 presidential campaign in the final weeks before Election Day.\n\nThe defense, well, they'll have one major goal in their closing argument - to discredit Cohen enough so that at least one juror doubts Trump's guilt. After that, 12 New Yorkers will decide whether or not Trump is guilty, and they'll do so in the context of a presidential election where Trump and President Joe Biden are neck-and-neck in the polls.\n\nSo what does it all mean? How do we look at this trial as a whole now that it's almost over? We called up a regular guest to sort through this, former prosecutor Harry Litman, who attended multiple days of the trial. I started by asking Harry how he would describe the trial in three words.\n\nHARRY LITMAN: A strong prosecution narrative. And if I had to do another three, it would be - I want a - I just want a fourth word.\n\nDETROW: We'll give you a fourth word.\n\nLITMAN: Prosecution narrative defense no. I think what really is the most salient of what's going on, going - coming into closing is that they've told - successfully told a tight story that reinforces itself across all kinds of witnesses. And the defense haven't done a counter narrative. They're not required under the law. But in my experience, it's so much better to have a story, a theory, like, you know. And that's what an alibi is, say...\n\nDETROW: Yeah.\n\nLITMAN: ...Or someone out there - if you had to, in a phrase, capture what the defense closing is going to be or what their pitch to the jury is, I think you'd be very hard pressed. It would be something like Michael Cohen's a liar. But that's just not enough to carry the day, I think, when there's such a strong story on the other side.\n\nDETROW: I want to come back to your point that you think the prosecution made a really strong case and told a really strong story in a moment. But we've really focused on the prosecution a lot in this podcast because, you know, it had several - four-plus weeks of witnesses. The defense came and went with its side before we could even tape our usual Saturday podcast.\n\nWhen you think about the holes in the defense's arguments from your point of view, are you thinking about the fact that they only called two witnesses, and one of those witnesses was pretty problematic on the stand, or are you thinking more about how they cross-examined all of the witnesses throughout the trial?\n\nLITMAN: Well, here's the main theme to me. In a normal case like this, even with a very prominent client, a prominent defense lawyer would say, sit down and shut up and let me handle this. We're in a different venue than you're familiar with. But by all accounts, Trump insisted on making key decisions, and they all seem really flawed to me. And so, for example, Stormy Daniels, their position's going to be that they didn't have sex at all - totally unnecessary for the defense and such a heavy load to carry. Bob Costello, who they called. Why the hell would you call Bob Costello?\n\nDETROW: Can you contextualize for listeners who weren't paying as close attention who Robert Costello was, what the point seemed to be of bringing him to the stand and just why it was such a debacle in your word?\n\nLITMAN: Sure. So he was a guy who, for a time, was flirting with representing Michael Cohen. But what the evidence showed he was is a complete kind of ally of Rudy Giuliani, who at that point had taken over the Trump defense. And Cohen got the sense, and the email traffic that we showed in court totally substantiated, that Costello was playing a double game where he was trying to prevent Cohen from cooperating with authorities, which is straightforward obstruction.\n\nBut moreover, that's a kind of crappy lawyer, especially once Cohen is served a search warrant and the - and law enforcement is looking at him. That's who he was for the prosecution, someone who shows that Trump is trying to keep Cohen from cooperating. For the defense, I think he's just a guy who Trump in Trump's Manichean world, there are loyalists and non-loyalists, he's still a loyal guy, and I think he wanted to use Costello to say, hey, Michael Cohen's a liar.\n\nDETROW: So we've got closing arguments on Tuesday, and then there's jury instructions. And you and many others have said that jury instructions are particularly important in this case. Can you explain why that is?\n\nLITMAN: Sure - and particularly tricky. So the falsifying business records, which most people understand is what it's about, that's a misdemeanor under New York law. However, it becomes a felony and it's charged as a felony when you do it with the intent to further another crime. And where it gets really tricky here is that the DA has not specified what the other crime is, but rather given a menu of three possibilities. But each of the possibilities is imperfect, and it's just kind of a funky situation to tell the jury. But he will tell them this - you don't have to agree. You know, you four can think it's felony A, you four B and you four C. And also, there's a very slippery intent standard where you don't have to complete the crime. It's not even beyond a reasonable doubt. It's just your intent in doing the underlying thing - which you show beyond a reasonable doubt - was to further this other crime.\n\nSo it's something that either a jury could kind of get lost in and have trouble kind of holding on to, or more worrisome, I think, is there are a couple lawyers on the jury and they could really take it super seriously and kind of, you know, walk it through to an endpoint and find in very legalistic reasons that they haven't quite made that case for the felony. It's a tricky issue to get the misdemeanor up to a felony.\n\nDETROW: Just kind of thinking ahead a little bit. Can we do a little bit of a decision tree? And can you tell us what happens next under each outcome? If he's found guilty, what happens next? When do we know what the sentence will be? What could the sentence be?\n\nLITMAN: It'll take a few months. There'll be a pre-sentence report. A lot of defendants don't get time for this kind of crime. But I think the - given the aggravating factors and what Merchan will see is dishonesty, I expect it'll be a few months. That's all it would be. At that point, he would move Trump for bail pending appeal. Let me stay out while I take this up on appeal, which would take a couple years or 18 months, and Merchan will grant it. So no chance, as I see it, he's actually incarcerated before November.\n\nDETROW: What about a hung jury? Is there a chance we could do this entire trial over again?\n\nLITMAN: You know, there is, in that I think the prosecution will want to do it. But the real question is, will they do it immediately before November? I don't think they will, mainly because even if you could do it logistically, I think for both Bragg and Merchan to bite off another sort of three months in the middle of elections and conventions and home stretch and be subject to that charge of really interfering with the election, the way Trump puts it, I think they will not want to own. So I think they will retry it, but not until after the election. And, of course, once the election happens, all bets are off.\n\nDETROW: And then a not-guilty verdict. Obviously, that would have enormous political implications that we would talk about. But legally, does anything happen next or is that it? Trump walks out of the courtroom and that's it.\n\nLITMAN: Yeah. Legally, it's the double jeopardy clause for, you know, you are a free person. My concern or my observation is he might take a hung jury and essentially play it as a victory, and then it'll be a war of words in the media. It shouldn't play that way but it easily could. But an acquittal, the chances of which I put at zero, would, in fact, be the absolute end of the line. And that's the guarantee of the Constitution.\n\nDETROW: Thinking of other high-profile trials of my lifetime - and I can't forget the fact that O.J. Simpson's jury took about four hours to reach a verdict. Do you have a sense of how long deliberations could take for a case like this?\n\nLITMAN: So, to me, you wouldn't expect anything until the end of day Thursday, say, and that would be quick. Friday afternoon, to me, is the sort of pivot point where one would expect, you know, that would be the sort of over under for me of when you'd get a verdict. And even if it went into the next week, I don't think you'd be biting your nails and saying this is a hung jury until, say, Monday or Tuesday. But if I'm betting just one time, you - it would be Friday afternoon.\n\nDETROW: Harry Litman, first-person observer to former President Trump's trial over the past six weeks and a legal expert. Thanks so much for joining us again.\n\nLITMAN: A pleasure to be there and a pleasure to be here.

Bragg and Judge Merchan are running the real trial in the court of public opinion, not to deliver justice but to hurt Trump's presidential campaign by branding him a convicted felon during the election. They seek to do this by lying to the jury -- for example, by pretending to have a criminal theory.\n\nThe prosecution rested their case without specifying the second crime, nor giving a shred of evidence for the first: even if we took Michael Cohen's testimony at face value, ignoring that he's a serial perjurer who confessed to six different felonies on Monday morning alone, his claim that Trump himself ordered the monthly payments that were calculated from Cohen's loan reimbursement demand and deemed them \"legal fees\" would not constitute a crime.\n\nThat case is dead in the water on appeal, but Merchan's parallel trial, which has little to do with established law and instead runs on innuendo and vagaries, aims for a temporary conviction. In it, Cohen and David Pecker explain election law to a rigged jury while Merchan allows the prosecution to dazzle them with inadmissible evidence and irrelevant, noncriminal details couched in nefarious-sounding terms like \"hush money\" and \"catch and kill,\" all the while keeping crucial information like Cohen's SDNY charges and Brad Smith's expert testimony on actual election law from reaching the jury.\n\nMerchan reneged on his promise to release the jury instructions by Thursday night, apparently to prevent lawyers from picking apart his instructions so the jury don't find out how preposterous they are, because they're going to read the news and talk to friends, family, and co-workers in the week Merchan gave them off.\n\nMerchan and Bragg are attempting to fool the jurors into a guilty verdict by feeding their bias and denying them the information to make an informed decision. The second, \"underlying\" crime has not been named, and Merchan just told the jurors it can be whatever they want it to be and turned them loose for a week, during which they will undoubtedly hear of and read news reports charging Trump with all manner of fake crimes, any one of which they're now free to consider Trump's underlying crime.\n\nIf they convict him, Harry Litman thinks (13 min.) it will take \"a few months\" to move Trump's case from \"bail pending appeal\" to the appeals process, which would land Trump in the middle of the summer before the appeal is filed, after months of wall-to-wall media coverage drilling Trump's \"Convicted Felon\" status into the public's brains.\n\nThe underlying charge, then, on which the validity of the case relies, is literally anything, and Bragg's charges only exist in the mind of the juror.\n\nIn the pretend trial, which is to say, the one that's based on the law, the prosecution's arguments start to take shape if you look at things as they are. It's a scoundrels' court and an organized crime racket. The first sign of that is Merchan: if N.Y. cases are assigned randomly, as they're supposed to be, how was the same judge picked for Donald Trump, Allen Weisselberg, and Steve Bannon's trials?\n\nIt harkens back to 2017, when Judge Emmet Sullivan was assigned to General Flynn's case six months after being assigned to Blumenthal v. Trump. General Flynn was prosecuted by Robert Mueller during the Russia Hoax after taking the National Security Advisor position under Trump. He pleaded guilty and the judge accepted it, only to mysteriously recuse himself and reassign the case to Sullivan, who repeatedly postponed sentencing until the DoJ ordered the case dismissed altogether, at which point Sullivan refused to. He was as bad as Judge Merchan, and it seemed he was assigned to the case for that reason.\n\nIt just so happens that Trump's NDA Trial was also set into motion by Mueller during the Russia Hoax, who referred Michael Cohen to the SDNY, ostensibly for his dealings with Russians (which were completely made up). They raided his hotel and caught him in a perjury trap, supposedly, over a Trump Hotel project in Moscow.\n\nBut Cohen committed bank fraud and tax evasion to the tune of over $4 Million, faced 4-5 years in prison and they had him dead to rights. That's why he told the SDNY in front of Bob Costello he'd do anything to stay out of jail. The purpose, of course, as Costello said was to get him to roll on Trump, but he didn't have anything on Trump, and you won't get a plea deal if you have nothing to offer. The charges were serious, as the SDNY stressed in his case file, and Cohen was desperate to stay out of jail. Costello advised him, the SDNY wanted dirt on Trump.\n\nSo Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violation, an insignificant charge next to his others. Andrew McCarthy, the former SDNY prosecutor who wrote the book on this, doubts they would have charged it at all otherwise. He was trying to help them \"Get Trump\" in exchange for leniency.\n\nIn the end they declined to press charges, probably because putting Cohen on the stand themselves was too risky, and he got a three-year sentence but served most it under home arrest. He says they double-crossed him, but this looks to me like a ploy to make his testimony look sincere, not purchased by letting him stay out of jail.\n\nCohen's guilty plea, McCarthy stresses, does not actually mean he is guilty, as neither judge nor jury looked at his case. The plea is only admissible in court to impeach Cohen as a witness; it certainly can't used to imply Trump's guilt in the same crime by association. But that's exactly what N.Y. did and Merchan allowed.\n\nTo convict Trump, in theory, they must prove he ordered the bookkeeping, knew the rules, and intended to defraud, and a target of the fraud was harmed; that the legal fees truly were loan reimbursements and weren't for legal matters; and that he did it to conceal unreported campaign finance payments.\n\nBragg hasn't done any of that and the finance charge is impossible, which voids everything. Trump met Cohen and Weisselberg in January, when the election was over and the campaign finance reports for that period weren't due yet. He could have simply repaid Cohen and reported it, which would make no difference to the election anyway, as it would be over.\n\nFurther, Cohen was his lawyer: you don't need a written retainer to establish that, nor must a lawyer be currently working to be on retainer. Cohen agreed to be Trump's personal attorney, told people he was, and sent invoices that said he was on retainer. He says he wasn't Trump's lawyer, but he perjured himself saying the same thing about Costello.\n\nIt's all a big fat lie and the DA's office knew Cohen would tell it. Mark Levin calls that, \"suborning perjury.\"\n\nI'm not sure that goes far enough.

After arguments have been made, jury deliberations will begin.\n\nWhatever the ultimate outcome, this will mark the first time in the United States' 248-year history that jurors have evaluated a criminal case against a former president.\n\nIn an article published by the conservative website The Bulwark on May 28, former federal prosecutor Dennis Aftergut describes some of the things that attorney Joshua Steinglass -- a prosecutor for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg Jr.'s office -- needs to tell jurors during his closing argument in order to show criminal intent.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Champion of white supremacy': Columnist says Trump's 'noxious bigotry' reveals 'true mindset'\n\n\"In a nutshell,\" Aftergut explains, \"there's powerful evidence that: (1) the business records falsely represented that Trump's $35,000 checks to Michael Cohen were for legal expenses when they were really reimbursements for Cohen's $130,000 purchase, on Trump's behalf, of Stormy Daniels' silence before the 2016 election, (2) Trump knew the representations in the records were false; (3) he either made them, or caused them to be made; and (4) he had a fraudulent intent.\"\n\nThe former federal prosecutor continues, \"But for a felony conviction, the jury must also be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the fifth element -- that Trump intended to commit violations of election law or tax law. If the jury is going to hang, it will almost certainly be over whether there's reasonable doubt over the existence of that intent.\"\n\nIn New York State, hush money payments per se are not a felony. But Aftergut notes that in that state, it is \"illegal to conspire to promote a candidate by unlawful means.\"\n\n\"It appears that the judge will instruct jurors that they can 'mix and match,'\" Aftergut notes. \"In other words, jurors don't have to unanimously agree on which of the three possible 'other crimes' Trump intended to commit or conceal -- just that he did intend to commit or conceal one of them. Because prosecutors produced no testimony of that intent, his lawyer will likely argue that even if Trump falsified his business records, he only intended to do so to keep the voting public in the dark about his sexual encounter with Daniels.\"\n\nREAD MORE:'It only gets worse': Political science professor details what a second Trump presidency would mean\n\nAftergut adds, \"That's why former

The jurors will be tasked with deciding if the prosecutors proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Central to that decision will be their assessment of the credibility of star witness Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and self-described fixer.\n\nBy his own admission at trial, Cohen has lied, cheated and stolen -- including from the Trump Organization. That may seem like a problem for the prosecution. Yet in my experience, it is anything but. The very fact that Cohen himself admitted to his prior lies and criminal activity may very well lead the jury to credit his testimony and use it to convict Trump.\n\nIn my 30 years as a prosecutor, I dealt with countless \"cooperating witnesses\" -- CWs for short. That term most precisely describes defendants who plead guilty to their crimes and enter into a cooperation agreement with prosecutors to testify fully, truthfully and accurately about the crimes of others. In exchange, the cooperating witness receives a reduced plea or a more lenient sentence.\n\nAs part of the deal, the cooperating witness must also admit to and be prepared to testify about the crimes they themselves committed. This standard practice is vital to building the witness's credibility. You can't expect a jury to believe testimony about the crimes of others if the cooperating witness is unable or unwilling to fess up to his own crimes.\n\nCohen is what I'd call a de facto cooperating witness. He pleaded guilty to his crimes and agreed to testify against Trump, but without entering into a formal cooperation agreement with prosecutors.\n\nCohen may be a deeply flawed individual and someone who was all too willing to commit crimes for his boss and for his own financial gain. But he's also an entirely typical cooperating witness: someone perfectly positioned to expose to the jury the crimes of the bigger fish in the corrupt scheme.\n\nA conspiracy is a secret agreement between two or more people to commit crimes. By their very nature, these criminal agreements are designed to shield the conspiracy from public view. This is why prosecutors work mightily to corral an insider -- a co-conspirator -- and develop that person as a cooperating witness who can authoritatively inform jurors about what was going on inside the conspiracy.\n\nBut as former criminals, cooperating witnesses generally have plenty of baggage. Which brings us back to Cohen.\n\nIn many ways, Cohen was a nearly perfect cooperating witness. He was in direct communication with the bigger criminal fish. He even had a covert audio recording that helped prove Trump was involved in the corrupt scheme to hide damaging information for political advantage. Cohen testified that he committed crimes at the direction of Trump and, importantly, for the benefit of Trump.\n\nThe fact that the crimes inarguably inured to Trump's benefit -- he, not Cohen, was the one running for (and ultimately winning) elected office -- will not be lost on the jury. Indeed, though Cohen may have hoped to benefit in the future from helping Trump, these crimes arguably worked to the immediate detriment of Cohen. He had to take out a home-equity line of credit just to muster the $130,000 payment.\n\nCohen spent more than 20 hours on the witness stand, reportedly without becoming angry, belligerent or losing his cool. The same cannot be said of the only defense witness of consequence, Robert Costello. Though Costello is himself a lawyer, he was beyond belligerent, and Judge Juan Merchan at one point cleared the courtroom to admonish Costello for his \"contemptuous\" behavior. The jury undoubtedly took note of the dramatic contrast between Cohen's performance and Costello's.\n\nTwo points in Cohen's testimony were touted in the media as deeply damaging to his credibility: the fact that he may have mixed up the date of the precise phone call in which he told Trump he had made the hush money payment, and the fact that Cohen stole $30,000 from the Trump Organization.\n\nThis old prosecutor saw those two bits of Cohen's testimony quite differently. Were I prosecuting this case, I would address the phone call in my rebuttal argument -- not my initial closing argument -- after the defense undoubtedly addresses it in their closing argument. Then I would ask the jurors if they had precise recall of the date and time of phone conversations from eight years ago. The question answers itself. So, whether Cohen told Trump in a call on a Wednesday or a Thursday is immaterial.\n\nMore importantly, does anyone believe Trump would have begun writing Cohen a series of $35,000 checks from his personal bank account if Cohen had not told Trump the payment was made? Please!\n\nThe second revelation -- that Cohen stole $30,000 from Trump -- is a perceived weakness that I would turn into a strength. In closing arguments, defense attorneys frequently fall into a trap of urging the jury to disbelieve a cooperating witness' testimony that incriminates their client but believe the same testimony when it incriminates the witness.\n\nThe defense attorney likely will tell the jury, \"You can't credit Cohen's testimony because he's a thief, having stolen from the very person he, as an attorney, was supposed to zealously represent.\"\n\nThat argument carries some superficial appeal. But I would rebut it this way:\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, who is it that proved to you that Michael Cohen stole $30,000 from the Trump organization? It was Michael Cohen himself, in his sworn testimony! And here's the important part -- Cohen's testimony about his theft was uncorroborated. No other witness came in here and testified about it. There was no audio recording exposing it. There were no business records confirming it.\n\nSo the defense is telling you to credit Michael Cohen's uncorroborated testimony when he tells you he stole $30,000 from Trump. Yet, when Cohen's testimony is corroborated by other witnesses -- by audio recordings, by phone records, by business ledger entries, and by Trump-signed checks falsely purporting to be reimbursement for legal services -- when Cohen is corroborated eight ways to Sunday, the defense urges you to disbelieve his testimony?\n\nLet's be clear, the defense wants you to credit Cohen's uncorroborated account of his own misconduct, but disbelieve Cohen's fully corroborated testimony if it hurts Trump. Ladies and gentlemen, the defense has just invited you to fall for the bait and switch. But we know you won't.\"\n\nI would finish by reminding the jury that the prosecution didn't choose Cohen as a witness. Trump chose him as a witness when he allegedly enlisted him in his corrupt scheme to pay hush money and falsify business records to gain an unfair advantage in a presidential election. Cohen may very well have lied, cheated and stolen, but he also testified about what he did as Trump's co-conspirator, his partner in crime. And soon, a jury will get to decide if that testimony, together with the significant corroborating evidence, is enough to prove Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSNBC.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_state's_evidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turn state's evidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Convict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_boss", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crime boss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtroom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Courtroom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corroborating_evidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corroborating evidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bait-and-switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bait-and-switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-05/240514-Michael-Cohen-ch-1619-e38889.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

In one telling exchange, defense lawyers even sought to highlight part of the mismanagement.\n\nTrump's former fixer Michael Cohen was on the stand describing his various efforts on Trump's behalf. In an attempt to undermine Cohen's credibility with the jury, Trump attorney Todd Blanche asked Cohen about an effort to rig online polls for Trump. Cohen said he'd initially agreed to pay a company called RedFinch Solutions $50,000, but later cut it to just $20,000. But when he went to be reimbursed, he asked for the entire $50,000.\n\nIn the end, he testified that he was paid more than double that amount because of a practice of \"grossing up\" -- increasing the payment to cover the income tax.\n\nBlanche asked if Cohen \"stole from the Trump Organization,\" and Cohen admitted without hesitation that he had. Trump's allies sought to portray this as a damaging moment for the prosecution, and it certainly wasn't helpful for Cohen's credibility as a witness. Trump's son Eric gloated about the admission on social media, saying the trial \"just got interesting.\"\n\nBut the younger Trump, an executive vice president of the Trump Organization, should be a little more interested in how Cohen got away with it.\n\nMany Americans have been reimbursed by their boss at some point, whether for buying a cake for an office birthday party or for going out of town for a conference. If you have, you know the first rule: Save the receipt. Often, you have to scan it, upload it to some cumbersome software program, and fill in a bunch of fields to explain how you paid, what it was for, and why it was necessary for the business.\n\nCohen somehow got reimbursed for five times what he spent -- for a total of $100,000. Again, to rig a couple of online polls.\n\nIt gets weirder.\n\nIn a 2019 Wall Street Journal article that first reported the payment, RedFinch Solutions owner John Gauger said he met Cohen at his office in Trump Tower to be paid and was handed \"a blue Walmart bag containing between $12,000 and $13,000 in cash and, randomly, a boxing glove that Mr. Cohen said had been worn by a Brazilian mixed-martial arts fighter.\" (Cohen denied that description at the time, saying Gauger was paid by check.)\n\nThe Wall Street Journal also reported that the repayment was made solely based on a handwritten note from Cohen. He did not, as it turns out, save the receipt.\n\nThis was just the latest account to undermine Trump's long-vaunted business acumen. Earlier this year, a New York judge ordered Trump to pay $355 million in penalties (later reduced to $175 million) after finding that the Trump Organization had duped banks and insurers by overstating his wealth on financial statements. In a blistering 92-page opinion, the judge wrote, \"The frauds here leap off the page.\"\n\nAs a result of that case, Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization's former chief financial officer, pleaded guilty to two counts of perjury after already serving 100 days in jail for avoiding taxes on $1.7 million in company perks. During the case, a court-appointed independent monitor also found that the company needed to change its procedures and update financial statements, noting that despite cooperating, the organization still regularly provided documents \"lacking in completeness and timeliness.\"\n\nMuch of this can be chalked up to the Trump Organization being a privately held conglomerate. Because they aren't listed on stock exchanges, privately held companies don't have to meet the strict disclosure requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Still, few of the more than 25 million privately held companies in the U.S. are run in as slipshod a manner as these various stories have shown.\n\nAnd that boardroom? The one shown on TV was a set, built by \"The Apprentice\" crew to be easier to film.\n\nIn a 2018 documentary, show producer Bill Pruitt said the real boardroom in Trump Tower was much less impressive. \"If you walked around Trump's actual office in Trump Tower you'd see the wood's chipped, and what's that smell?\" he said in the film. \"It wasn't the empire we were going to have to sell to people. We needed to gussy it up a bit. And we did.\"\n\nWhatever else it accomplishes, the hush money trial has again pulled back the curtain to reveal the real boardroom, and it's not a pretty sight.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_teague_beckwith@yahoo.com", "name": "Ryan Teague Beckwith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apprentice_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Apprentice (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Income tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Weisselberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allen Weisselberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trump Tower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privately_held_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privately held company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walmart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Organic", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Organic", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cKH8dMakW0lUoFvaTMUF3w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/msnbc_articles_593/a9b76cb5d8354e1f2ca5e2d723772b35", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

After that, it is anyone's guess when they will return and what they'll decide.\n\nBut if he is found guilty on even one count - just one of a few possible outcomes - Mr Trump would become the first former US president with a criminal conviction, and the first major party candidate to run for the White House as a felon.\n\nSome key questions about what could come with a guilty verdict.\n\nWhat happens with a guilty verdict?\n\nIf the verdict is guilty, Mr Trump will probably still be able to leave the court as a free man until Justice Juan Merchan schedules a sentencing hearing, as he has been free on bail throughout the trial.\n\nThe judge has several factors to consider in sentencing, including Mr Trump's age (77), lack of previous conviction and possibly his violations of the court's gag orders.\n\nThe sentence could involve a fine, probation or supervision, or possibly prison time.\n\nGetty ImagesMr Trump's team may use Stormy Daniels' testimony as grounds for appeal\n\nMr Trump would almost certainly appeal against a guilty verdict, a process that could take months or even longer.\n\nHis legal team would then face the Appellate Division in Manhattan, and possibly the Court of Appeals.\n\nThis all means it would be highly unlikely that Mr Trump will leave the court in handcuffs, and he would be expected to remain free on bail while he appeals.\n\nWhat would be the grounds for appeal?\n\nThe evidence of adult film star Stormy Daniels, whose alleged sexual encounter with Mr Trump is at the heart of the case, could be one reason.\n\n\"The level of detail that was provided [by Ms Daniels] is really not necessary to the telling of the story,\" said Anna Cominsky, a professor at New York Law School.\n\n\"On the one hand, her detail makes her credible and as a prosecutor, you want to provide enough detail so the jury believes what she has to say. On the other hand, there's a line, where it could become irrelevant and prejudicial.\"\n\nMr Trump's defence team twice called for a mistrial during Ms Daniels' testimony, motions that were denied by the judge.\n\nCould Trump go to prison?\n\nIt is possible, though highly unlikely, that Mr Trump would serve time behind bars in the event of a guilty verdict.\n\nThe 34 charges he faces facing are all class E felonies in New York, the lowest tier in the state. Each charge carries a maximum sentence of four years.\n\nThere are several reasons why Justice Merchan could choose a lesser punishment, including Mr Trump's age, his lack of previous convictions, and the fact that the charges involve a non-violent crime.\n\nIt is also possible that the judge would weigh the unprecedented nature of the case, perhaps choosing to avoid putting a former president and current candidate behind bars.\n\nThere is also a question of practicality. Mr Trump, like all former presidents, is entitled to lifelong protection from the Secret Service. This means that some agents would need to protect him in prison.\n\nEven so, it would in all likelihood be extremely difficult to run a prison system with a former president as an inmate. It would be a huge security risk and expensive to keep him safe.\n\n\"Prison systems care about two things: security of the institution and keeping costs down,\" said Justin Paperny, director of the prison consulting firm White Collar Advice.\n\nWith Mr Trump, \"it would be a freak show... no warden would allow it\", he said.\n\nCould he still run for president?\n\nYes. The US Constitution sets out relatively few eligibility requirements for presidential candidates: they must be at least 35, be a \"natural born\" US citizen and have lived in the US for at least 14 years. There are no rules blocking candidates with criminal records.\n\nBut a guilty verdict still could sway November's presidential election. A poll from Bloomberg and Morning Consult earlier this year found that 53% of voters in key swing states would refuse to vote for the Republican if he were convicted.\n\nAnother poll, from Quinnipiac University this month, showed 6% of Trump voters would be less likely to vote for him - consequential in such a tight race.\n\nCould he pardon himself?\n\nNo. Presidents can issue pardons for those who have committed federal offences. The hush-money case in New York is a state matter, meaning it would be out of Mr Trump's reach.\n\nThe same is true for Mr Trump's case in Georgia, where he has been accused of criminally conspiring to overturn his narrow defeat by President Joe Biden in the state during the 2020 election. This case is currently tied up in appeals.\n\nPardon powers are unclear for Mr Trump's two federal cases - one concerning the alleged mishandling of classified documents, and the other on conspiring to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nIn the first, a Trump-appointed judge in Florida has indefinitely postponed the trial, saying setting a date before resolving questions about evidence would be \"imprudent\". The second outstanding federal case also was delayed while an appeal from Mr Trump plays out.\n\nNeither are likely to take place before the November election, but even if they did, constitutional scholars disagree on whether a president's pardon power includes himself. Mr Trump could be the first to try.", "source": {"uri": "the-star.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "https@the-star.co.ke", "name": "https", "type": "author",

Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, paid Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, $130,000 in return for her silence about allegations of an affair with Trump in 2006.\n\nWARNING SIGNS FOR TRUMP AND BIDEN AS THEY CAREEN TOWARDS NEXT MONTH'S FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE\n\nBoth Cohen and Daniels testified for the prosecution and were grilled by Trump's attorneys during cross-examination in a case that has grabbed tons of attention on the cable news networks, online and on social media.\n\nThe former president has repeatedly denied falsifying business records as well as the alleged sexual encounter with Daniels, and he has repeatedly claimed, without providing evidence, that the case is a \"SHAM TRIAL instigated and prosecuted directly from the inner halls of the White House and DOJ.\"\n\nTrump has also been fined a couple of times, and threatened with jail, by the judge in the case for violating a gag order aimed at protecting witnesses and jurors from the former president's verbal attacks.\n\nAccording to a Fox News national poll conducted earlier this month, nearly half of registered voters questioned said Trump had done something illegal when it comes to violations of campaign finance laws, with another quarter saying he had done something unethical.\n\nTHE BLUE STATES TRUMP AIMS TO FLIP RED IN HIS 2024 REMATCH WITH BIDEN\n\nOnly 27% said the former president had done nothing seriously wrong. However, that number jumped to 54% among Trump supporters.\n\nThat same survey indicated that voters were roughly divided on whether Trump's legal treatment was fair (51%) or unfair (47%). There was an expected extremely wide partisan divide, with nine out of 10 Democrats saying the former president's treatment was fair and 85% of Republicans disagreeing.\n\nWould a Trump guilty verdict dramatically alter the current state of play in the presidential showdown?\n\nA handful of recent national polls suggest the answer is not really.\n\nAmong them, 62% of registered voters questioned in a Quinnipiac University survey said a guilty verdict would make no difference to their vote for president. Fifteen percent said it would make them more likely to cast a ballot for Trump, and 21% said it would make them less likely to vote for the former president.\n\nAdditionally, eight out of 10 Trump supporters surveyed in an ABC News/Ipsos national poll said they would still back the presumptive GOP presidential nominee if he was found guilty in court. Sixteen percent said they would reconsider their support, and 4% said they would no longer back Trump.\n\nAnderson, a member of the Fox News Election Decision Team and the Democratic partner on the Fox News Poll, compared a potential guilty verdict to the infamous video that briefly damaged Trump's chances of winning the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\"We might see an 'Access Hollywood' type slump in Trump's poll numbers, where some of his less devoted supporters sour on him temporarily, but then by November it will seem forgivable,\" Anderson said. \" So I don't think a guilty verdict would fundamentally change the landscape of the race, but it will certainly be a new contour that could be meaningful in a close race.\"\n\nNewhouse, who served as a pollster on four Republican presidential campaigns and is a co-founder of the political survey and polling firm Public Opinion Strategies, highlighted that \"attitudes are so set in concrete regarding both President Biden and former President Trump that a guilty verdict in the hush money is unlikely to make any difference at all on the presidential ballot.\"\n\n\"Those who back Trump believe this is nothing more than a political witch hunt, while those who oppose him came to a guilty verdict before the trial ever began,\" he emphasized.\n\nHowever, Anderson spotlighted that the history-making trial would have an impact.\n\n\"Regardless of the verdict, this trial clearly isn't what Trump wants to be dealing with right now and has not helped him,\" Anderson said. \"What might help him is a not guilty verdict that will allow him to claim vindication. But even then, it's a real stretch to imagine it becomes a net positive for him.\"\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital

The jury will then consider whether to render a historic verdict. Polls show that the proceedings may change few votes, but there's potential peril ahead for Trump.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has turned his legal woes into a conservative cause celebre.\n\nThe greatest test of that strategy could arrive as soon as next week. Closing arguments in Trump's Manhattan hush money criminal trial are expected to occur on Tuesday. Twelve New Yorkers will then weigh the possibility of a historic verdict: finding the first-ever former president guilty in a criminal trial.\n\nPolling shows that a guilty verdict has some potential peril. But the strongest possibility is that voters will tune it out entirely in favor of economic issues, on which Trump scores far higher than President Joe Biden.\n\nVoters are paying attention to the trial but have thus far largely discounted it.\n\nTrump and his allies might not have to spin much.\n\nIn a recent Quinnipiac University nationwide poll, 62% of voters said a guilty verdict would not affect their vote in November. In comparison, just 21% said it would change their minds.\n\nA Cook Political Report polling partnership that surveyed seven battleground states found that 40% of voters said Trump's legal woes had no impact on their support or were unsure. Interestingly, the same survey found voters were broadly aware of Trump's problems when asked about the hush money trial, a previous civil fraud trial, and a separate civil trial that found the former president liable for sexually assaulting columnist E. Jean Carroll decades ago.\n\nVoters were also asked by the Cook partnership whether they were more concerned about Biden's age or Trump's temperament and legal issues. Narrowly (53% to 47%), they said Biden's age was more concerning.\n\nTrump has rallied Republicans, but the broader public isn't entirely convinced.\n\nTrump has repeatedly shown he can rally Republicans to his side when his legal problems mount. But the average voter is not a GOP member of Congress nor responding to Trump's fundraising appeals.\n\nDespite Trump's and allies' efforts to cast doubt on the entire prosecution, some polls have found that Americans see legitimacy in the process. A Yahoo News/YouGov poll found that since last month, the hush money trial's approval has increased slightly; there's now a 12-point margin of approval (49%-37%).\n\nThat's not to say many voters are sympathetic to some of Trump's claims. A recent New York Times/Siena College poll of voters in key battleground states found that among registered voters, slightly more (49%) thought that the former president would not get a fair trial than those who did (45%).\n\nAnd if there is one clear takeaway from recent polling it's that the American people do think the former president did something wrong, even if he may not have broken the law. The same Yahoo poll found that a majority of Americans (52%) believe Trump falsified business records \" to conceal a hush money payment to a porn star\" -- the charge at the center of the Manhattan case. The Quinnipiac survey that showed voters may not be motivated by the trial also found that 46% of voters believe Trump did something illegal -- another 27% believe he did something unethical but not illegal.\n\nThose responses are in stark contrast to the GOP officials, led by Speaker Mike Johnson, who have slammed the trial as a sham.\n\nTrump's reaction will loom over the verdict.\n\nTrump has never been one to take setbacks lightly. He's under a gag order that does not allow him to criticize witnesses, the jury, or Merchan's daughter. Once the verdict is in, Trump can unleash whatever criticism he desires.\n\nIt's not hard to imagine that in responding to a potential guilty verdict Trump lashes out in a way that causes him more problems. His attacks on judges have historically triggered some of the rare instances when Republicans speak out more broadly against him. It was then-Speaker Paul Ryan who called Trump's suggestion that a federal judge couldn't fairly adjudicate a case because of his Mexican heritage the \"textbook definition\" of racism.\n\nBut Trump has constantly been able to count on almost all of his fellow Republicans. The FBI's decision to search Mar-a-Lago marked another point of vulnerability for Trump. Almost immediately, top GOP officials rallied to his side.\n\nThen-House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy proclaimed that the Justice Department had reached an \"intolerable state of weaponized politicization.\" Even former Vice President Mike Pence, who had been harshly critical of Trump, expressed concern about the FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe repeated shows of unity in the face of a new Trump indictment became so common that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis later complained that they \"distorted the primary.\"\n\nThe easiest prediction is that Trump's verdict will likely spawn a wave of donations. According to a Politico analysis, Trump's legal woes are among his most effective fundraising appeals. Trump had one of his best fundraising days since launching his presidential campaign on March 22 when the former president warned his followers that New York Attorney General Tish James might try to seize his assets in connection with a civil fraud verdict.\n\nDuring the Manhattan criminal trial, Trump has sent repeated fundraising appeals, including when Justice Juan Merchan found Trump in contempt for violating his gag order.\n\nThere are obvious costs to such efforts. Trump has relied on his network of political groups to help pay his legal bills. President Joe Biden mounted a significant early cash advantage. While other parts of Trump's orbit have been forced to come to the aid of Save America, the main outfit that has paid Trump's legal fees. According to its most recent filing, the leadership PAC owes over $1.1 million to Trump's lawyers. If the former president is found guilty, his almost certain appeal would likely further draw on this fund for support.\n\nStill, there may never be another day in American history like the one about to unfold.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brent_d_griffiths@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Brent D.

That the single assignation in Lake Tahoe on July 13, 2006 occurred when first-time mother Melania was home in New York with infant Barron, who would celebrate his four-month birthday four days later, adds to the tawdriness, but not the legal exposure.\n\nThe first crime, as the assistant district attorneys will explain, was when Trump henchman Michael Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 in exchange for her keeping quiet. The money was wired on Oct. 27, 2016, 12 days before the Nov. 8 election and 20 days after the notorious \"Access Hollywood\" tape came out with Trump bragging about freely groping women.\n\nAlready wounded by his own voice and image on video, Trump had every reason to prevent Daniels from telling of their tryst which could torpedo his campaign and he conspired with Cohen to silence Daniels with the cash payment. Such a large sum meant to influence an imminent election was a federal campaign finance felony that Cohen would later plead guilty to and serve prison time for. Keep that Cohen crime in mind.\n\nTrump's crimes, according to the DA, would come after he was in the White House and he was repaying Cohen. In the ledgers of his real estate business, the Trump Organization, Trump had 34 times caused to have entered falsehoods that the money being sent to Cohen was for \"legal expenses.\" They were not \"legal expenses.\" Lying on business records in New York is a misdemeanor, but if it is done to further another crime, the misdemeanor becomes a felony.\n\nRemember Cohen's felony? Putting it together with the rigged books, you get 34 felonies by Trump from the fake notations listed in the records. If the money to Cohen was designated as \"Stormy payoffs\" there would be no lie and therefore no crime.\n\nSo Trump's nature for him to lie about everything is what may finally sink him. Decades ago, Trump used to call reporters at this paper and elsewhere, falsely claiming to be PR man John Miller or John Barron, peddling some pro-Trump gossip. That may have been the origin of the name of Barron that would be bestowed on his youngest child.\n\nThese lies about the Cohen repayments are not the worst of Trump's alleged crimes, like trying to overturn a fair presidential election in several states or subverting the certification by Congress or attempting to keep classified documents even when the federal government tried to recover. Those offenses go to his abuse of power when he held the highest office in the land.\n\nAt issue today and to be adjudged by the Manhattan jury this week are mundane lies by Trump, but they go to everything that Trump has been doing for nearly 78 years. He has always been a liar and a cheat and a charlatan, a nice word for a con man. That is his charm and his roguish appeal.\n\nIt's fine for the host of a cheesy reality show, but it's a terrible fit for a president.", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news",

Trump's mens rea and knowledge at the time are integral to determining if he is innocent, if he just committed a misdemeanor by falsifying business records of said hush money payments, or if he committed a felony by falsifying the records as he intended to break elections laws, thus committing another crime in the process of already committing a crime.\n\nSo, at the end of the day, what exactly could influence the verdict's direction one way or the other?\n\nFormer FBI director James Comey believes the likelihood of Trump being acquitted is slim to none, with a hung jury result being more probable, and a conviction being the most likely outcome. However, some people do not think it is as clear-cut as that.\n\nFirst off, and unsurprisingly, a lot relies on the credibility of Michael Cohen's testimony, which is likely to be the main point the defense will hold on to, since Cohen, during and prior to his testimony at the Manhattan trial, had already proven himself not to be the most honest and unbiased of individuals. They will surely bring up the way in which Cohen has profited off media appearances to speak his mind on what he thinks of Trump - spoiler alert, not highly.\n\nHowever, if the jury believes Cohen -- which can't be said with certainty -- the former Trump lawyer and CFO has painted a pretty damning picture that goes through the whole guilty checklist. In addition, David Pecker dealt Trump a major heartbreak by testifying that the latter is indeed linked to the hush money payments and corroborated the notion that the former president desired to have all unfavorable news stories about him silenced, giving more credibility to some of Cohen's accounts.\n\nEverything else hinges mainly on arguably strong circumstantial evidence, which points to the fact that Trump was at the center of all of this -- like the Sun at the center of a planetary system, but not in a good way -- and he was the one to benefit the most, at the end of the day, from the hush money payments and their subsequent unlawful disguise. Trump also did not testify, despite his previous confirmation that he would. While testifying would surely have been a devastating mistake, it also meant that Trump's first-person side of the story has been omitted from the jury's considerations.\n\nIn the end, as Ankush Khardori -- a former federal prosecutor at the Department of Justice -- Politico argues, it may all come down to closing arguments and how well the prosecution can weave a clear narrative that points towards Trump's involvement in the crimes he's accused of, or, conversely, how well the defense can emphasize holes in the DA's narrative to establish reasonable doubt. As the author writes, \"It is rare -- the stuff of movies -- for a case to plausibly turn on the quality of each side's closing argument, but this could be one of those cases.\"\n\nIn this case, jury instructions will also be most relevant because if they allow for more wiggle room, it will benefit the prosecution, whereas the defense is likely to want the instructions to be as rigid as possible, and to make the criteria for conviction more difficult to come up with in the deliberation room.\n\nIt is rare for closing arguments to be the most decisive factor, because, by that point, all the evidence should have come out during trial.

Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, paid Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, $130,000 in return for her silence about allegations of an affair with Trump in 2006.\n\nWARNING SIGNS FOR TRUMP AND BIDEN AS THEY CAREEN TOWARDS NEXT MONTH'S FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE\n\nBoth Cohen and Daniels testified for the prosecution and were grilled by Trump's attorneys during cross-examination in a case that has grabbed tons of attention on the cable news networks, online and on social media.\n\nThe former president has repeatedly denied falsifying business records as well as the alleged sexual encounter with Daniels, and he has repeatedly claimed, without providing evidence, that the case is a \"SHAM TRIAL instigated and prosecuted directly from the inner halls of the White House and DOJ.\"\n\nTrump has also been fined a couple of times, and threatened with jail, by the judge in the case for violating a gag order aimed at protecting witnesses and jurors from the former president's verbal attacks.\n\nAccording to a Fox News national poll conducted earlier this month, nearly half of registered voters questioned said Trump had done something illegal when it comes to violations of campaign finance laws, with another quarter saying he had done something unethical.\n\nTHE BLUE STATES TRUMP AIMS TO FLIP RED IN HIS 2024 REMATCH WITH BIDEN\n\nOnly 27% said the former president had done nothing seriously wrong. However, that number jumped to 54% among Trump supporters.\n\nThat same survey indicated that voters were roughly divided on whether Trump's legal treatment was fair (51%) or unfair (47%). There was an expected extremely wide partisan divide, with nine out of 10 Democrats saying the former president's treatment was fair and 85% of Republicans disagreeing.\n\nWould a Trump guilty verdict dramatically alter the current state of play in the presidential showdown?\n\nA handful of recent national polls suggest the answer is not really.\n\nAmong them, 62% of registered voters questioned in a Quinnipiac University survey said a guilty verdict would make no difference to their vote for president. Fifteen percent said it would make them more likely to cast a ballot for Trump, and 21% said it would make them less likely to vote for the former president.\n\nAdditionally, eight out of 10 Trump supporters surveyed in an ABC News/Ipsos national poll said they would still back the presumptive GOP presidential nominee if he was found guilty in court. Sixteen percent said they would reconsider their support, and 4% said they would no longer back Trump.\n\nAnderson, a member of the Fox News Election Decision Team and the Democratic partner on the Fox News Poll, compared a potential guilty verdict to the infamous video that briefly damaged Trump's chances of winning the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\"We might see an 'Access Hollywood' type slump in Trump's poll numbers, where some of his less devoted supporters sour on him temporarily, but then by November it will seem forgivable,\" Anderson said. \" So I don't think a guilty verdict would fundamentally change the landscape of the race, but it will certainly be a new contour that could be meaningful in a close race.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNewhouse, who served as a pollster on four Republican presidential campaigns and is a co-founder of the political survey and polling firm Public Opinion Strategies, highlighted that \"attitudes are so set in concrete regarding both President Biden and former President Trump that a guilty verdict in the hush money is unlikely to make any difference at all on the presidential ballot.\"\n\n\"Those who back Trump believe this is nothing more than a political witch hunt, while those who oppose him came to a guilty verdict before the trial ever began,\" he emphasized.\n\nHowever, Anderson spotlighted that the history-making trial would have an impact.\n\n\"Regardless of the verdict, this trial clearly isn't what Trump wants to be dealing with right now and has not helped him,\" Anderson said. \"What might help him is a not guilty verdict that will allow him to claim vindication. But even then, it's a real stretch to imagine it becomes a net positive for him.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxwilmington.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "foxwilmington.com"}, "authors": [],

Any two or more persons who conspire to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means and which conspiracy is acted upon by one or more of the parties thereto, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\"\n\nThe 34 records in this case consist of 11 checks cut to Michael Cohen, a former personal attorney to President Trump, and the corresponding vouchers and invoices. Prosecutors allege these payments, categorized as legal expenses, were reimbursement for money Mr. Cohen paid to Stephanie Clifford, better known as adult actress Stormy Daniels, as part of a scheme to influence the 2016 elections.\n\nIn order to prove their case, prosecutors need to show that President Trump had the intent to defraud -- more specifically, the intent to conceal the alleged conspiracy -- when causing the creation of the business records.\n\nDavid Pecker, former head of American Media, Inc. (AMI) and publisher of the National Enquirer, was the first to take the witness stand.\n\nOver several days, he outlined an agreement with Mr. Trump and collaboration with Mr. Cohen as AMI purchased two stories that Mr. Pecker believed would harm the 2016 Trump campaign. Neither of the two deals Mr. Pecker was involved in are related to the current charges, but prosecutors argued they provide important context and evidence toward a conspiracy.\n\nNext, longtime Trump assistant Rhona Graff testified, affirming that she had entered contact information for key people in the case into her contact management system, offering evidence that Mr. Trump was in touch with alleged co-conspirators.\n\nThen Gary Farro, a banker formerly with First Republic Bank, took the witness stand to affirm the creation of accounts for Mr. Cohen's LLCs, and confirm the $131,000 wire transfer.\n\nRobert Browning, executive director of C-SPAN's archives, took the witness stand to allow into evidence several video clips of President Trump campaigning. Philip Thompson, a regional director at Esquire Deposition Solutions, testified to the authenticity of a deposition transcript from another Trump case.\n\nLawyer Keith Davidson next testified, detailing his representation of Karen McDougal and later Ms. Clifford, and his dealings with Mr. Cohen to complete a settlement contract for Ms. Clifford. Several revealing texts were entered into evidence throughout his testimony, showing exchanges between Mr. Davidson and others.\n\nThen, two members of the district attorney's office were called to the witness stand. Forensic analyst Doug Daus had reviewed Mr. Cohen's cell phones, and through his testimony phone records were admitted into evidence. Paralegal Georgia Longstreet had reviewed President Trump's social media posts and several were entered into the record, including ones depicting a change in attitude toward Mr. Cohen.\n\nNext, Hope Hicks, former Trump campaign communications director testified and affirmed then-candidate Trump's schedule on key dates, allowing into evidence emails exchanged within the Trump campaign.\n\nJeffrey McConney, former Trump Organization comptroller, testified about his oversight of the process of accepting and processing Mr. Cohen's invoices, which Mr. McConney categorized as legal expenses, allowing into evidence email exchanges about the payments. Deb Tarasoff, a bookkeeper for The Trump Organization who worked under Mr. McConney, testified she processed these invoices, cutting the checks Mr. Trump ultimately signed.\n\nSally Franklin with Random House was then called to the witness stand to read into the record several excerpts from Trump books on life and business advice. Later during the trial, Tracey Menzies with Harper Collins read into the records from other Trump books.\n\nWhen Ms. Clifford took the witness stand, it was to a crowded courthouse. Ms. Clifford, whom the judge described as a \"difficult to control\" witness, gave salacious details in her testimony that led to the defense calling for a mistrial, which the judge denied on the basis that the issues could be resolved during cross-examination.\n\nNext, Trump Organization employee Rebecca Manochio testified that she shipped checks from Trump Tower to Washington for President Trump to sign in 2017. Former Oval Office Director of Operations Madeleine Westerhout testified that she saw President Trump signing checks, which had been sent through FedEx to bodyguard Keith Schiller and later herself.\n\nDaniel Dixon with AT&T and Jennie Tomalin with Verizon testified to the authenticity of phone records that were then entered into evidence. Paralegal Jaden Jarmell-Schneider, with the district attorney's office, created summary charts of records from Mr. Cohen's phone the prosecutors believed relevant to the case.\n\nFinally, Mr. Cohen testified as the final witness for the prosecutors, with testimony lasting a week.\n\nThe defense called few witnesses: Paralegal Danny Sitko, with defense attorney Todd Blanche's office, had created summary charts of phone records between Mr. Cohen and attorney Robert Costello. Mr. Costello's testimony refuted claims Mr. Cohen made that Mr. Costello was meant to keep tabs on him for Rudy Giuliani, who later became an attorney to President Trump.\n\nTwo people frequently mentioned in testimony were unavailable to the court. The first, Dylan Howard, chief content officer for AMI, initially brought the Clifford deal to the attention of Mr. Pecker and Mr. Cohen. Mr. Howard facilitated the purchase of the three stories mentioned at trial, and received and sent many texts shown in court exchanged between him and Mr. Davidson and Mr. Cohen. Mr. Howard now lives in Australia and is unable to travel due to a serious health condition.\n\nAlso unavailable was Allen Weisselberg, who is currently serving a five-month prison sentence for committing perjury in a separate civil fraud case that went to trial last fall. Mr. Weisselberg, the former CFO of The Trump Organization, came up with the idea to pay Mr. Cohen $420,000. Mr. Cohen could not testify as to why his reimbursement request for $130,000 was grossed up to $420,000, saying \"I just wanted to get my money back.\"\n\n...\n\nDefense attorneys made two requests for the judge to make a significant decision before turning things over to the jury: to dismiss the case or to find Mr. Cohen's testimony not credible.\n\nJustice Merchan is likely to issue a quick ruling on the motion, as he already instructed jurors to be present for closing arguments after the long weekend.\n\nJustice Merchan asked jurors to prepare for a long day today.\n\nSummations from both sides are expected to last the whole day, and the judge said his instructions to the jury would take an hour.\n\nProsecutors will sum up their case by reminding jurors of what they believe is the most compelling evidence. But for the defense, especially having called only two witnesses, this will be a key moment to present their own narrative.\n\nDefense attorneys are expected to argue that nothing criminal occurred, as the nondisclosure agreements are legal, as is the payment of an attorney for legal services, and that the promotion of a person in an election through lawful means is not a crime.\n\nOn May 21, the judge held a charge conference with attorneys, who debated over what language would be used to instruct jurors on the applicable laws and their interpretation.\n\nIn some cases in which Justice Merchan rejected the attorneys' proposed language, he said they could argue those points at summations on May 28.\n\nThe charge conference allowed both parties to present to the judge arguments about why certain language would prejudice their side, allowing the judge to put together an instruction script that avoids such prejudice.\n\nHow the judge delivers this interpretation of the law will inevitably influence the jury's decision.\n\nShould jurors be instructed that President Trump needed to have \"willfully\" concealed intent to defraud?\n\nShould the instructions include an example explaining that a legal expense might not classify as a campaign expenditure?\n\nShould jurors be told up front all the things prosecutors are not required to show?\n\nShould jurors be given an example of what it means \"to cause a false entry to be made\"?\n\nThe jurors will work on May 29, when previously they have taken Wednesdays off, to begin deliberations while closing arguments are still fresh in their minds.\n\nThe jury's job is to determine the facts of this case and decide whether those actions violated the law.\n\nIf the 12 jurors don't come to a unanimous decision, the case will end in a mistrial.\n\nThere is no set time in which the jurors are required to return their verdict; a decision could be returned the same day or even take weeks.", "source": {"uri":

The news from Mr. Trump's trial is based on reports from journalists in the room.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's New York criminal trial has featured gripping, and at times steamy, testimony from a former tabloid publisher on the secrets of his business, a porn star on her alleged tryst with Mr. Trump, and a former Trump lawyer on how his boss allegedly paid to silence the porn star.\n\nFor the media outlets reporting on every twist and turn, the month-long event has provided a steady stream of content for readers and viewers - despite the fact that, at heart, the case is actually about the falsification of business records. By all accounts the jurors, too, have paid rapt attention.\n\nBut while the Trump case has generated heavy coverage on cable news and in social media, it has not risen to \"trial of the century\" levels, comparable to the O.J. Simpson trial. Indeed, a recent Yahoo News/YouGov poll found only 16% of respondents said they were following the trial \"very closely.\" Another 32% said they were following it \"somewhat closely.\"\n\nThere have been no large-scale demonstrations or altercations outside the courthouse. Outbursts inside have also been limited.\n\nOne reason it did not become the O.J. trial may be because New York law prevents cameras inside the courtroom. Former NFL star O.J. Simpson's 1995 trial for the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman was carried live on TV, and generated historic levels of audience and media interest. By contrast, the cable news analysts parsing every new development in Mr. Trump's legal proceedings had to do it based on second-hand reports from journalists in the room.\n\n\"Without the cameras in the courtroom, the trial averted some of the spectacle and theatrics of a televised trial like the O.J. Simpson case,\" says Roy Gutterman, director of Syracuse University's Tully Center for Free Speech, in an email.\n\nClosing arguments in the Trump hush money trial are scheduled for Tuesday. The defense will go first. Then the prosecution will attempt to convince 12 jurors that Mr. Trump falsified business records to cover up his alleged affair with porn star Stormy Daniels because he was worried that if it became public, it would damage his chances in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMr. Trump has denied the affair with Ms. Daniels, as well as all other charges. His defense will argue that the central figure in the prosecution's case, former Trump lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, is a proven liar whose testimony cannot be trusted. Mr. Cohen was the only witness to tie Mr. Trump directly to payments to Ms. Daniels, though circumstantial evidence did point to the former president's involvement.\n\nThe prosecution has the higher bar to clear, given that it must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. That means it must convince jurors of a narrative that explains what happened.\n\nThe defense does not have to offer an alternative story. It simply must convince the jury that reasonable doubt about the prosecution's case remains. Defense attorneys can throw any number of hamburgers against the wall to see if any ketchup sticks. Their argument does not necessarily have to be coherent.\n\n\"Chaos, unpredictable things, things that are not related to proof of guilt, generally favor the defense,\" says Dilan Esper, a 29-year civil litigator in California.\n\nMedia coverage is one of those unpredictable things. Reporters want stories, and their efforts can sometimes upend prosecution plans. In the O.J. trial, prosecutors had a witness ready to testify that she saw the ex-football star driving fast and erratically outside his ex-wife's home around the time she was murdered. But she sold her story for $5,000 to the tabloid TV show \"Hard Copy,\" and lead prosecutor Marcia Clark decided she was too tainted to put on the stand.\n\nAs far as we know, nothing like that has occurred in the Trump trial. But the former president and his attorneys have followed a strategy of trying to create as much news as possible, in part because they know reporters will eat it up. Thus the daily displays of Republican officials, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, showing up in court to support Mr. Trump and hold their own press conferences.\n\nMr. Trump's insistence that he would testify - though he didn't in the end - may also have been a calculated move. Perhaps Mr. Trump really did want to take the stand. But in many big trials, defense attorneys tell the media that the defendant is considering speaking under oath. It forces prosecutors to waste time preparing for something the defense knows isn't going to happen.\n\nThe media can't help but report the \"may testify\" gambit as news. \"In fact, [they're] being played,\" says Mr. Esper.\n\nThe Trump criminal trial has produced a number of dramatic courtroom moments. Stormy Daniels' pointillistic recounting of her alleged Trump tryst - she recalled the shampoo in his bathroom was not just Pert, but Pert Plus - stilled the audience, according to reporters who were there. The cross-examination of Ms. Daniels was tense as defense lawyers tried to portray her as a money-driven opportunist.\n\nMr. Cohen's turn on the stand was grueling, stretching over days. At one point, a defense attorney was shouting at him as they questioned whether he had really talked with Mr. Trump about payments to Ms. Daniels. Mr. Cohen remained largely composed, and it remains to be seen how the jury interpreted this key testimony.\n\nFor sheer drama, the most memorable moment was perhaps a May 20 incident that revolved around lawyer Robert Costello.\n\nIt began when Judge Merchan took umbrage with what he felt was Mr. Costello's impudence on the stand concerning overruled objections by the defense.\n\n\"When there is a witness on the stand, if you don't like my ruling, you don't say 'jeez', OK?\" said the judge with uncharacteristic fire.\n\nJudge Merchan then tried to clear the court so he could rebuke Mr. Costello. But the media didn't want to go.\n\n\"This is an open courtroom. It is open to the people, open to the public. You can't throw us out!\" said one journalist, unnamed in the official court transcript.\n\nA press lawyer got involved. Judicial staff kept politely pushing. Eventually, they moved the audience into a hallway.\n\n\"Let the record reflect ... that the court officers had great difficulty clearing the courtroom, because the courtroom is made up, primarily, of the press,\" Judge Merchan said.\n\nAt the end of the O.J. Simpson trial, 150 million people tuned in to watch the verdict live.\n\nBy contrast, Americans will not be able to see the verdict being read from the New York courtroom where the Trump trial is playing out.\n\nWhen the verdict comes down, as throughout the trial, the public will be relying on reporters and commentators, \"who did a commendable job of delivering detailed coverage and analysis,\" says Professor Gutterman, himself a former reporter.\n\nStill, no description or report is the same as seeing things live on television - and some observers say that may have been to the detriment of the American people in this case.\n\n\"There would have been significant problems and risks of things getting out of control had this case been televised,\" says Professor Gutterman. \"But I still believe open courts is important to facilitating the public's understanding of the law and criminal justice.\"", "source": {"uri": "csmonitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Science Monitor"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christian_science_monitor@csmonitor.com", "name": "Christian Science Monitor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "O.

The campaign's social media team is considering leveraging the line of attack further, with discussions underway about referring to the ex-president online as \"Convicted Felon Donald Trump.\"\n\nHis team is also preparing for a barrage of Republican and Trump attacks if the former president's acquitted or if there's a hung jury.\n\nClosing arguments are set for Tuesday and the jury could reach its decision as early as next week. And Biden will speak at some point after that -- a definitive decision on timing and setting has not yet been made -- no matter the outcome, whether it be a conviction, acquittal or hung jury. The message will be different for specific rulings, but the fundamental point will remain the same: That America's legal system worked and that the process should be respected.\n\nOne of the four anonymous people familiar with the deliberations said it's critical that the American people believe the legal system works, \"especially in an election year.\"\n\n\"This is an important moment and the president first and foremost needs to stress that the American system works, even and especially in an election year,\" the individual said. \"And in a measured way, it becomes part of his argument against Trump too: Do Americans really want this?\"\n\nPolitico claimed that Biden \"will likely discuss a guilty verdict at times on the campaign trail,\" but his team \"doesn't view even a conviction as likely to meaningfully change the trajectory of the campaign.\"\n\n\"Aides do not believe the trial has resonated widely with voters outside the Acela corridor,\" Politico reported. \"But it could make a difference along the margins, and that may matter in a race expected to be extremely close.\"\n\nThe report went on to detail how Democrats anticipating a guilty verdict are divided on how to approach it politically.\n\nJennifer Palmieri, former communications director for President Barack Obama, said, \"I don't think [Biden] needs to run to the briefing room to talk about this.\"\n\n\"But, at some point, he should address the conviction saying that a jury of Donald Trump's peers have convicted him of a crime and it would do extraordinary damage to the standing of the United States and to the credibility of our democratic system for someone Americans found guilty of a crime to then be elected president.\"\n\nLikewise, Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) cautioned his colleagues not to openly celebrate Trump's conviction.\n\n\"I don't think it's important to rub it in,\" he said. \"I don't think anybody on our side should be reacting with glee. It just should be a tragedy that an American president has been convicted of real crimes.\"\n\nMatt Bennett, executive vice president for public affairs at the center-left think tank Third Way, said Biden should stay out of the fray if Trump is convicted.\n\n\"If he's convicted, he will be called by everyone in Democratic politics 'convicted felon Donald Trump,'\" Bennett said.\n\nBiden doesn't \"need to engage with it, because everyone else will,\" he added.\n\nGiven the tone of the report, Democrats view a conviction as the most likely outcome of the \"hush money\" trial, which isn't surprising considering the makeup of the jury in deep blue Manhattan.\n\nAdditionally, Judge Juan Merchan told the jury they don't have to agree on a \"predicate crime\" Trump allegedly committed, whether that be campaign finance violations or tax evasion.\n\nTo find Trump guilty of felony-level falsification of business documents, the jury must unanimously find that Trump falsified the documents in order to commit or conceal a separate crime. But the jurors do not all have to agree on what that separate crime was, Justice Juan Merchan ruled.\n\nBiden's upcoming speech from the White House, contrary to his belief it will make him look less political, will actually convey the opposite, critics claim.\n\n\"Why are they putting this message out now? To send a message to the judge and jury that the White House is watching them.

The odds Trump can't secure even a single hold-out juror may be low, even in heavily Democratic Manhattan.\n\nBut if the jury does find Trump guilty, Judge Juan Merchan will then determine Trump's sentence. There are a range of outcomes at sentencing. If the jury finds Trump guilty he could face more than 10 years in prison. But Merchan could also forego prison and instead place him on probation with jail time only if he violates specific conditions.\n\nIf Trump is found guilty Merchan should not sentence him to prison. There are several reasons why. First, a single state-court judge's decision shouldn't materially impact a nation presidential election. At least not here, where the underlying facts happened seven years ago and the prosecution's legal theory is highly controversial , even outside pro-Trump circles. Longtime Trump critic Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, for example, put it this way : \"I believe President Trump's character and conduct make him unfit for office. Even so, I believe the New York prosecutor has stretched to reach felony criminal charges in order to fit a political agenda.\"\n\nIt's hard to predict how a prison sentence would influence the election; it could easily help Trump, whose popularity grew after last year's indictment. But it would undoubtedly impact voters' thinking if Trump is in jail (or awaiting jail time) on election night.\n\nNor should a single state-court judge potentially trigger a constitutional crisis. For example, if Trump wins the election and then orders his own release from a New York jail, the conflict between federal and state authorities would be unprecedented. There would also be severe practical difficulties with imprisoning Trump, including administering federal secret-service protection in a state-run prison facility.\n\nOther more traditional factors considered at sentencing also weigh against sending Trump to jail. He isn't accused of committing a violent crime. Nor was there a direct victim: Trump didn't steal the money from anyone; he gave it to Stormy Daniels in a questionable manner. And despite his many decades teeming with controversies and investigations , Trump has never before been convicted of a crime.\n\nTrump is not above the law, as he so often thinks he is. But neither is he beneath it, as many of his political opponents want him to be. With the election approaching, it's essential to American democracy and the rule of law that these factors are given due weight.\n\nThere's a legitimate debate about whether Trump's egregious behavior in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election -- the focus of criminal matters in Washington D.C. and Georgia -- was sufficiently criminal to warrant jail time for the Republican presidential nominee in an election year. And reasonable minds can differ on that question. But when it comes to this specific trial in New York, one thing should be clear to everyone, including Merchan: paying hush money to Stormy Daniels simply doesn't rise to that level.", "source": {"uri": "inforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "INFORUM"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitt Romney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/dfeefce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1500+0+0/resize/1706x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffcc-cue-exports-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Finforum%2Fbinary%2FLetterToEditor_binary_1019586.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

And this landmark trial is one of the biggest news stories in the world.\n\nThe case is being brought by the Manhattan District Attorney's office, led by District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nIn March 2023, Trump was indicted by a Manhattan grand jury for allegedly falsifying business records related to a hush money payment in 2016.\n\nThat April in 2023, Trump surrendered at the Manhattan Criminal Court and was formally arrested and arraigned on the charges. He pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Trump family has been critical of the trial, with the former president repeatedly describing it as politically motivated. His son Donald Trump Jr. has been particularly vocal in his criticism of the trial, referring to it as a \"leftist spectacle\" and a \"Kangaroo Court\" on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nTrump was frequently accompanied by a sizeable contingent of supporters as he arrived at the courthouse.\n\nThe jury will have been paying attention. But how much do you know about the trial? It's time to put your knowledge to the test with our quiz. Are you going to object, become an expert witness or plead the fifth? Take the quiz and find out.\n\nAfter the defense rested its case last week, the judge heard arguments from the prosecution and defense regarding the jury instructions he will provide before deliberations commence. The court was in recess for a week, with closing arguments scheduled to begin on Tuesday, May 28. The jury is anticipated to receive the case and start deliberating on Wednesday, May 29.\n\nAfter closing arguments, Judge Juan Merchan will provide lengthy instructions to the jury on how to interpret the law and evidence during their deliberations.\n\nThe 12 jurors will then begin deliberating in private until they reach a unanimous verdict of guilty or not guilty on each of the 34 counts of falsifying business records. If they cannot unanimously agree, it would result in a mistrial.\n\nIf convicted, Trump would likely be sentenced several weeks or months later, though he would likely avoid prison time as a first-time offender for this nonviolent crime.\n\nLet us know in the comments below how you did in the quiz.

The New York Times reported that Merchan expects the arguments to last about a day, though the Hill noted he did state they could spill into a second day.\n\nWATCH -- Senator Tim Scott: D.A. Bragg Is Guilty of \"Trying to Frame\" Trump:\n\nTrump's defense will go first, followed by the prosecution. From there, jurors will deliberate whether or not the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is guilty of falsifying business records in connection to an alleged \"hush money\" payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nMerchan is hopeful deliberations will begin on Wednesday, per the Times.\n\nJurors were dismissed after the defense rested last Tuesday and will have had a week to consider the prosecution and defense's case before hearing the arguments.\n\nTrump's defense aimed to discredit the prosecution's two top witnesses, Daniels and disgraced former lawyer Michael Cohen, during cross-examinations. When questioning Daniels, the defense seemingly worked to paint the picture she sought to financially benefit from Trump's wealth and fame.\n\nWATCH -- CNN's Holmes: Turnout for Trump Bronx Rally \"Bigger\" Than Dems \"Would Like to See\":\n\nFor instance, Trump defense attorney Susan Necheles pressed Daniels about merchandise she sold following Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's indictment of Trump, as Breitbart News noted, citing the New York Times and Daily Caller's Katelynn Richardson:\n\nThese items included shirts, per the Times, a \"Stormy Daniels Political Power\" comic book, and a \"Stormy Saint of Indictments\" candle, which were shown to the jury.\n\nPer the Times' Jesse McKinley, the candle featured \"Daniels draped in a Christ-like robe.\"\n\nAt one point during the cross-examination, Necheles grilled Daniels over her \"Make America Horny Again\" strip club tour, saying she profited from it, as Richardson reported.\n\nSimilarly, when Cohen was on the stand, Trump's defense attorney, Todd Blanche, accused him of lying about a brief 2016 phone call to Trump's bodyguard, Keith Schiller, during which Cohen claimed to have notified Trump of an alleged payment to Daniels.\n\nBlanche implied that the call actually regarded harassing calls Cohen had received from a teen prankster, emphasizing text messages bookending the call between Schiller and Cohen were about the harassing calls.\n\nBreitbart News reported, citing Matthew Russell Lee of the Inner City Press:\n\nPer Lee's tweets, the call came in between texts to Schiller from Cohen regarding the harassing calls. The first text was at 7:48 p.m., and the second was at 8:14 p.m. The Daily Caller's Katelynn Richardson reported from the courtroom that Schiller \"left a voicemail at 8:01\" and followed up \"text me\" at 8:02 p.m. The disgraced former attorney then called him at 8:02.\n\n\"You lied about this. You said you didn't remember the harassing phone calls -- now you claim that in the one minute and 36 seconds call you spoke about the harasser and Stormy Daniels,\" Blanche said, per Lee.\n\nBlanche also highlighted Cohen's TikTok streams, where he has apparently fundraised while talking about the trial and Trump. In fact, Blanche's first question on cross-examination was about Cohen calling him \"a little shit on TikTok.\"\n\nThey're back.\n\nJustice Merchan: Mr. Blanche?\n\nTrump's lawyer Todd Blanche: We've never met, but you know who I am, don't you?\n\nCohen: Yes.\n\nBlanche: You called me a little shit on TikTok?\n\nCohen: Sounds like something I would say.\n\nJustice Mercan: Approach!\n\n-- Inner City Press (@innercitypress) May 14, 2024\n\nMeanwhile, Merchan hit Trump with a sweeping gag order that essentially prevents him from talking about anyone involved in the trial other than Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and Merchan. He has found Trump in violation of the order ten times.\n\n\"What the judge did was amazing, actually, was amazing,\" Trump told reporters as he left the court on May 10. \"Everybody can say whatever they want. They can say whatever they want, but I'm not allowed to say anything about anybody.

After that, it is anyone's guess when they will return and what they'll decide.\n\nBut if he is found guilty on even one count - just one of a few possible outcomes - Mr Trump would become the first former US president with a criminal conviction, and the first major party candidate to run for the White House as a felon.\n\nSome key questions about what could come with a guilty verdict.\n\nIf the verdict is guilty, Mr Trump will probably still be able to leave the court as a free man until Justice Juan Merchan schedules a sentencing hearing, as he has been free on bail throughout the trial.\n\nThe judge has several factors to consider in sentencing, including Mr Trump's age (77), lack of previous conviction and possibly his violations of the court's gag orders.\n\nThe sentence could involve a fine, probation or supervision, or possibly prison time.\n\nMr Trump would almost certainly appeal against a guilty verdict, a process that could take months or even longer.\n\nHis legal team would then face the Appellate Division in Manhattan, and possibly the Court of Appeals.\n\nThis all means it would be highly unlikely that Mr Trump will leave the court in handcuffs, and he would be expected to remain free on bail while he appeals.\n\nThe evidence of adult film star Stormy Daniels, whose alleged sexual encounter with Mr Trump is at the heart of the case, could be one reason.\n\n\"The level of detail that was provided [by Ms Daniels] is really not necessary to the telling of the story,\" said Anna Cominsky, a professor at New York Law School.\n\n\"On the one hand, her detail makes her credible and as a prosecutor, you want to provide enough detail so the jury believes what she has to say. On the other hand, there's a line, where it could become irrelevant and prejudicial.\"\n\nMr Trump's defence team twice called for a mistrial during Ms Daniels' testimony, motions that were denied by the judge.\n\nIt is possible, though highly unlikely, that Mr Trump would serve time behind bars in the event of a guilty verdict.\n\nThe 34 charges he faces facing are all class E felonies in New York, the lowest tier in the state. Each charge carries a maximum sentence of four years.\n\nThere are several reasons why Justice Merchan could choose a lesser punishment, including Mr Trump's age, his lack of previous convictions, and the fact that the charges involve a non-violent crime.\n\nIt is also possible that the judge would weigh the unprecedented nature of the case, perhaps choosing to avoid putting a former president and current candidate behind bars.\n\nThere is also a question of practicality. Mr Trump, like all former presidents, is entitled to lifelong protection from the Secret Service. This means that some agents would need to protect him in prison.\n\nEven so, it would in all likelihood be extremely difficult to run a prison system with a former president as an inmate. It would be a huge security risk and expensive to keep him safe.\n\n\"Prison systems care about two things: security of the institution and keeping costs down,\" said Justin Paperny, director of the prison consulting firm White Collar Advice.\n\nWith Mr Trump, \"it would be a freak show... no warden would allow it\", he said.\n\nYes. The US Constitution sets out relatively few eligibility requirements for presidential candidates: they must be at least 35, be a \"natural born\" US citizen and have lived in the US for at least 14 years. There are no rules blocking candidates with criminal records.\n\nBut a guilty verdict still could sway November's presidential election. A poll from Bloomberg and Morning Consult earlier this year found that 53% of voters in key swing states would refuse to vote for the Republican if he were convicted.\n\nAnother poll, from Quinnipiac University this month, showed 6% of Trump voters would be less likely to vote for him - consequential in such a tight race.\n\nNo. Presidents can issue pardons for those who have committed federal offences. The hush-money case in New York is a state matter, meaning it would be out of Mr Trump's reach.\n\nThe same is true for Mr Trump's case in Georgia, where he has been accused of criminally conspiring to overturn his narrow defeat by President Joe Biden in the state during the 2020 election. This case is currently tied up in appeals.\n\nPardon powers are unclear for Mr Trump's two federal cases - one concerning the alleged mishandling of classified documents, and the other on conspiring to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nIn the first, a Trump-appointed judge in Florida has indefinitely postponed the trial, saying setting a date before resolving questions about evidence would be \"imprudent\". The second outstanding federal case also was delayed while an appeal from Mr Trump plays out.\n\nNeither are likely to take place before the November election, but even if they did, constitutional scholars disagree on whether a president's pardon power includes himself. Mr Trump could be the first to try.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type":

On May 28, the prosecution and defense will sum up their cases, allowing jurors to deliberate on their verdict.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney has charged President Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records to the first degree, to which he has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThroughout the trial, prosecutors have shown emails, texts, phone call logs, contracts, and other documentation in efforts to establish that there was a scheme in place to influence the 2016 presidential election, and an effort to conceal it in the creation of 11 payments to ex-lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\nThey have argued that the records speak for themselves and are evidence of intent to defraud.\n\nHowever, the records are of mixed relevance. Some were directly related to the $420,000 payment to Mr. Cohen, while others included text conversations unrelated to the events of the case, or even book excerpts from old Trump books on business advice.\n\nDuring jury selection, prosecutors had used the example of a man hiring a hitman which seemed to annoy the defense, arguing that the man would be guilty even though he had not pulled the trigger.\n\nThey may remind jurors that the prosecutors needed to show that President Trump caused false records to be created, but not that he created them himself.\n\nThe rest of the 22 witnesses were called by prosecutors, largely to enter records into evidence, except for a few who gave lengthy, narrative testimonies, during which defense attorneys seized upon inconsistencies.\n\nStephanie Clifford, better known as adult performer Stormy Daniels, and Mr. Cohen are considered to be at the center of the case because the 34 business records comprising the charges are only falsified if it is found that they were created to cover up a scheme necessitating this payment.\n\nHowever, both witnesses were at times argumentative and evasive on the stand, gave inconsistent details, and acknowledged their animosity toward President Trump and financial interest in criticizing him publicly. Defense attorneys are likely to cast them both as opportunists.\n\nPresident Trump has denied an alleged sexual encounter with Ms. Clifford, and the defense pointed out during cross-examination of Ms. Clifford that she told different accounts of the alleged encounter at different times, and suggested her inconsistent claims about why she came out with her story showed motivation to extort.\n\nThe defense attorneys have argued that Mr. Cohen is a liar, pointing to his track record of lying under oath and possibly to his new admission of stealing at least $30,000 from the Trump Organization by requesting more than he was owed for a payment he made to Red Finch for polling services.\n\nTwo other witnesses gave longer testimonies, but much of it had been to provide context for an alleged scheme.\n\nDavid Pecker, former head of American Media Inc., testified for a week about stories he bought to suppress because he believed they would harm the Trump campaign. However, neither of those stories was related to the charges.\n\nKeith Davidson, attorney for Ms. Clifford, testified at length, offering color and context to the agreement Mr. Cohen entered into with Ms. Clifford. Mr. Davidson made it clear on the witness stand that the non-disclosure agreement they signed was a completely legal contract, something defense attorneys are likely to remind jurors.\n\nDefense attorneys will also be restricted from explaining the law to jurors, but they are likely to remind the jury that the non-disclosure agreement, popularly termed \"hush money\" by prosecutors, is completely legal, as is influencing an election through lawful means.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Davidson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keith Davidson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A360media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A360media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pecker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Pecker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-disclosure agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/05/21/id5654128-GettyImages-2153979291-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 167, "textEnd": 173}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Penny-pinching?\n\n'You bet. I'm all for it.'\n\nAlthough many of the headlines have focused on Trump's alleged affair with Stormy Daniels, the meat of the case against him is more prosaic: The 34 invoices, ledger entries and checks that were labeled as legal expenses, rather than a reimbursement to fixer Michael Cohen for paying off the porn star.\n\nAnd his books suggest Trump is an executive with a meticulous approach to money.\n\n'As I said before, I always sign my checks, so I know where my money's going,' he wrote in \"Trump: Think Like a Billionaire.\"\n\nDonald Trump did not take the stand at Manhattan criminal court but the jury heard plenty of his words, taken from audio recordings, social media posts and two of his books\n\nThe prosecution used extracts from \"Trump: Think Like a Billionaire\" to bolster its case\n\n'In the same spirit, I also always try to read my bills to make sure I'm not being overcharged.'\n\nJurors heard the text read aloud by Sally Franklin, a witness who is an executive and editor at Penguin Random House.\n\nThroughout, Trump hammers the point that he stays o top of every financial aspect of his business.\n\n'If you don't know every aspect of what you're doing, down to the paper clips, you're setting yourself up for some unwelcome surprises,' he wrote.\n\nThere were two other themes to the excerpts.\n\nThe jury was shown the well-known picture of Trump and Daniels, taken at a celebrity golf event in Lake Tahoe. She described their brief meeting and how he invited her for dinner after\n\nTrump denied all 34 felony counts of falsifying business documents\n\n'All the women on \"The Apprentice\" flirted with me -- consciously or unconsciously,' he wrote in Trump: How to Get Rich,' also published in 2004. 'That's to be expected.\n\n'A sexual dynamic is always present between people, unless you are asexual.'\n\nAnd another passage from the same book laid out how he views his enemies.\n\n'For many years I've said that if someone screws you, screw them back,' he wrote.\n\n'When somebody hurts you, you just go after them as viciously and as violently as you can. Like it says in the Bible, an eye for an eye.'\n\nProsecutors hoped the lines would help convince the jury that Trump was a tight-fisted and vindictive manager, who simply could not have been blind to an effort by his staff to buy and bill damaging stories.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spy (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apprentice_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Apprentice (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin_Random_House", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penguin Random House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tahoe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lake Tahoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Franklin County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Franklin County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Publishing_and_Printing/Publishing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Publishing and Printing/Publishing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Books", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Books", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/23/19/85018017-0-image-a-6_1716487416130.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

The former president is facing 34 charges in connection to a hush money payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels to allegedly keep quiet about an affair she said they had. Prosecutors claim that Trump falsified business records to conceal his involvement in the payment, which was made by Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe former president has pleaded not guilty to all counts involved and denies having an affair with Daniels.\n\nClosing arguments in the case will begin Tuesday morning, and a 12-person jury will begin their deliberations on Wednesday. But prior to handing it off to the panel, presiding Judge Juan Merchan will give jurors instructions on the law governing the case, a topic that was heavily debated by prosecutors and the defense team during the trial last week.\n\nWhile speaking to CNN on Monday, Gomez said that Merchan's instructions could play a huge role in the jury's ruling in Trump's case, telling anchors Boris Sanchez and Jessica Dean, \"It's when there is disagreement in the room when the juries really rely on those jury instructions.\"\n\n\"I think this is the context where those instructions can have a lot of power if they're clear and help guide these jurors,\" Gomez added.\n\nBoth sides in the case requested that Merchan include certain details in his instructions last week, which the Associated Press said are expected to take about an hour on Wednesday. Trump's attorneys had asked that the judge explain that the hush money payments at the center of the case do not inherently break the law, which prosecutors called \"totally inappropriate.\"\n\nThe defense also requested that Merchan consider the \"extraordinarily important\" makeup of the case in his instructions, although the judge said doing so would deviate from standard instructions proceedings. The debates happened outside of the jury's presence.\n\nIt only takes one juror in the 12-person panel to side with Trump for the former president to dodge charges in the case, and legal experts have said that the chance of a mistrial is far higher in the former president's situation than in a normal trial.\n\nWhen asked if she believed that the case could end in a mistrial, Gomez told CNN that a hung jury could happen in \"any case\" but concluded, \"Anything can happen in a trial like this, and it only takes one holdout.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to Trump's attorneys and the Manhattan district attorney's office via email on Monday for comment ahead of closing arguments.\n\nCNN legal analyst Elie Honig said last week that the prosecution could have a \"practical problem\" if the jury is not instructed on the complicated specifics around campaign finance law at the center of Trump's case, which Honig said have been \"so poorly defined\" by the prosecution.\n\n\"If the jury is going to be instructed that the other crime here is state or federal campaign finance law, don't they have to get into what that means?\" Honig noted.\n\nMeanwhile, conservative commentator Megyn Kelly has warned that Merchan's instructions could tip the jury against Trump.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The entire process was designed to achieve a conviction, not a fair trial. The prosecutor is a Soros-funded leftist who campaigned on getting Trump. The judge is a Biden donor. And finally, the jurisdiction is so heavily liberal that it would be nearly impossible to get an unbiased jury.\n\nFor the past few weeks, District Attorney Alvin Bragg's case has imploded as each of his key witnesses has undermined his case. Even left-wing experiments have admitted as much and have suggested that such Trump would likely be acquitted. But, as GWU law professor Jonathan Turley explains, a hung jury is still more likely.\n\nOriginally, Bragg vaguely referenced four crimes and there have been months of confusion was to what he was specifically alleging as his criminal theories. Even legal analysts on CNN and MSNBC have continued to question the specific allegations against Trump as we head into closing arguments.\n\nAs it stands, there are three crimes that have been referenced by prosecutors: state and federal election violations and taxation violations.\n\nBragg's legal vision for non-objective indictments was greatly advanced by Judge Juan Merchan, who will allow the jury to reach different rulings on what crime is actually evident in Bragg's paint splatters.\n\nMerchan has even ruled that the jurors can disagree on what actually occurred in terms of the second crime. This means there could be three groups of four jurors, with one believing that there was a conspiracy to conceal a state election violation, another believing there was a federal election violation (which Bragg cannot enforce), and a third believing there was a tax violation, respectively. Nonetheless, Merchan will treat that as a unanimous verdict.\n\nIn other words, they could look at the indictment and see vastly different shapes, but still send Trump to prison on their interpretations.\n\nTurley notes that Bragg's key witness, Michael Cohen, is a convicted perjurer whose credibility is questionable at best. Meanwhile, there is no direct evidence of Trump's intent or knowledge, so prosecutors have relied on circumstantial evidence to persuade jurors. Then there's the fact that non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) are common and perfectly legal in both business and politics. He then explained that the jury will be instructed that payments aren't campaign contributions if they would have been made regardless of the campaign. The defense must also clarify that Trump didn't classify the payments as legal expenses -- this was done by others in the Trump organization and Cohen, reflecting standard practice for payments to lawyers.\n\nStill, the deck has been stacked against Trump. It's not just the partisan prosecutor, judge, and jury, but even the jury instructions seemed to be tailor-made to ensure a conviction. But Turley still believes a hung jury is likely.\n\n\"You can throw paint on Cohen all day, but it will not cover up the fact that he is a pathological liar and grifter,\" Turley writes. \"That is why I still believe that a hung jury might even be the most likely possibility. That may change when we see Judge Merchan's final instructions. However, the only thing worse in New York than being a Trump supporter is being a chump. To rely solely on Cohen and not even call someone like Weisselberg is to play these jurors as chumps.\"", "source": {"uri": "pjmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PJ Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_margolis@pjmedia.com", "name": "Matt Margolis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Turley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Turley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_a_fair_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right to a fair trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-disclosure agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_instructions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury instructions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstantial_evidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Circumstantial evidence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Criminology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Criminology", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/113/dc684f78-36d0-4850-b301-cb1182b38199.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

He at least partially blames him for his prison sentence for crimes tied to the New York case. He admitted in court to calling Mr Trump a \"boorish cartoon misogynist\" and \"Cheeto-dusted\" villain. Jurors heard clips from Cohen's podcast screaming that \"revenge is a dish best served cold.\"\n\nDefense attorneys depicted Cohen as a disgruntled, selfish and fame-hungry opportunist. He was furious with a lower-than-usual bonus check, so he stole from Mr Trump's company, and then flipped against him when federal prosecutors snooped around his home and office, eventually turning the newfound attention into a multimillion-dollar business that revolves around trashing his old boss.\n\nBut on the witness stand in the Republican presidential nominee's criminal trial in Manhattan, Cohen -- his eyes wide and sunken, his hair graying and his Long Island accent softened -- admitted to and directly confronted his history of lies, convictions and shameful behavior that compromised his freedom and family.\n\nOver four days, he walked jurors through dozens of pieces of evidence, including the allegedly falsified business records that relate to each of the 34 counts against Mr Trump -- and that have Cohen's name stamped all over them.\n\nIn his testimony, Mr Trump's former attorney explained that his boss told him to \"handle\" hush money payments and nondisclosure agreements that would keep his campaign-crushing sex scandals out of the press before Election Day in 2016.\n\nWhen it came to covering up an adult film star's story about her alleged sexual encounter with Mr Trump for $130,000, Mr Trump allegedly told Cohen: \"Just do it.\"\n\nLess than two weeks before Election Day, Cohen finalized a contract and wired her attorney the cash. Then, he told Mr Trump that the deal was done. A satisfied president-elect Trump then approved a payment plan to reimburse his attorney before heading to Washington DC, where he signed the checks from the Oval Office, Cohen said.\n\n\"What I was doing,\" Cohen testified, \"was at the direction of and benefit of Mr Trump.\"\n\nHis entire life \"has been turned upside down as a direct result,\" he said during his final moments on the witness stand. \"I lost my law licenses, my business, my financial security ... My family's happiness is paramount.\"\n\nCohen's testimony was corroborated with 11 signed checks -- most of which include Mr Trump's Sharpie-inked signature -- stapled to Cohen's invoices, and 12 ledger entries that mark Cohen's payments as a \"legal expense\" pursuant to a \"retainer\" that even Mr Trump's defense attorneys admit never existed. Prosecutors used emails, text messages, call logs, encrypted chats and even surreptitiously recorded conversations with Mr Trump himself to carefully lay out the scheme.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche repeatedly reminded Cohen of his past praise for the former president -- how he admired him \"tremendously,\" called The Art of the Deal a \"masterpiece,\" and insisted he'd take a bullet for him.\n\n\"At the time, you weren't lying, right?\" Mr Blanche asked him.\n\n\"At that time, I was knee-deep into the cult of Donald Trump, yes,\" Cohen said.\n\n\"I was not lying,\" he added. \"It's how I felt.\"\n\nWhen jurors begin deliberations this month, they don't have to believe all the details of Cohen's life story. His past lies and shady behavior don't make the evidence against Mr Trump any less admissible.\n\nCohen's testimony gave jurors the connective tissue for the prosecution's narrative: Mr Trump warned Cohen to \"be prepared\" for stories about women when he launched his 2016 campaign, instructed him to pay them off, then signed the checks that reimbursed him, all as part of a plan drawn up by his accountants and finalized from the White House.\n\nBut the now-disbarred attorney has been keenly aware of the power of the information in his possession and has admitted to using it to his advantage.\n\nDuring the first day of cross-examination, he admitted that he asked about the benefits of meeting with Manhattan prosecutors about this case while he was locked up in federal prison.\n\nHe also admitted that he has a financial interest in the outcome of the case -- not necessarily if he's convicted, but because Mr Trump is a constant source of subject matter for his podcasts and TikTok account.\n\nIt would actually be better if Mr Trump is not convicted, he said, \"because it gives me more to talk about in the future.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com",

Those arguments will be followed by jury deliberations, and it remains to be seen whether a Manhattan jury will vote \"guilty\" or \"not guilty\" -- or if there will be a hung jury.\n\nMeanwhile, the three other criminal indictments Trump is facing appear unlikely to go to trial before the November election.\n\nRight-wing media outlets -- from Fox News, Fox Business, Newsmax TV and One America News to Breitbart News and Steve Bannon's \"War Room\" podcast -- have been portraying the trial as a political persecution, ignoring or downplaying the testimony that legal analysts on MSNBC and CNN have been describing in elaborate detail.\n\nREAD MORE: What to watch for in Trump trial's closing arguments\n\nSt. Louis-based journalist Eric Berger, in an article published by The Guardian on May 27, warns that right-wing media's trial coverage could benefit Trump politically.\n\nAccording to Berger, \"Trump has retained much of his political support amid his ongoing hush-money trial in part due to a combination of the courtroom's ban on cameras and conservative media echoing his claims that both the prosecutor and judge are corrupt, media analysts say. The experts suggest that the former president could retain political support on the right even if the jury determines he is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to his reimbursements to Michael Cohen for a payment to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign.\"\n\nMedia Matters' Matt Gertz told The Guardian that right-wing media outlets are painting the hush money trial as a \"witch-hunt ginned up by Joe Biden\" -- saying that Trump \"will be found not guilty\" but also \"arguing that if he is found guilty, it will be because the jury and the judge are partisan and corrupt.\" Gertz describes this approach as \"heads, we win/tails, you lose.\"\n\nGertz told The Guardian, \"They know that every alleged infraction or crime committed by Trump is an opportunity for them to prove that they are onboard with the MAGA movement and with Trump specifically by loudly saying that he did nothing wrong and that his pursuers are in fact the real criminals.\"\n\nREAD MORE:Trump suffered a 'stunning rebuke' in disastrous Saturday night speech: analyst\n\nHoward Polskin, president of the newsletter/website The Righting, believes that the lack of cameras in Justice Juan Merchan's courtroom benefits Trump.\n\nPolskin told The Guardian, \"It's Christmas in May for Trump.

I think there would have been a lot more coverage on both left, right and mainstream if that were the case.\"", "source": {"uri": "alternet.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alternet.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breitbart News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Bannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsmax_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsmax TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_America_News_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "One America News Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Hannity", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sean Hannity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Media bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Matters_for_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Media Matters for America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Community_Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Community Video", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=52331499&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C213", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 259, "textEnd": 265}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 1072, "textEnd": 1078}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-06-", "textStart": 44, "textEnd": 53}], "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

The former president has reportedly sold one of his private jets to an American business magnate for $10 million as his pockets continue to take a hit due to his surging legal costs.\n\nThis recent jet sale comes as his New York hush money trial enters its penultimate phase. Lawyers are expected to make their closing arguments in court today before the jury makes a verdict that could make history.\n\nThe former president has resorted to selling off some of his prized assets as the costs of his legal bills continue to spike.\n\nAccording to the Daily Beast, Trump's DT Air Corp company sold his 1997 Cessna jet to a Texas outfit called MM Fleet Holdings LLC, which is tied to Iranian-American construction mogul Mehrdad Moayedi. The jet's selling price is set at $10 million, although the terms of the transaction were not shared publicly.\n\nOn the Trump Aviation website, the billionaire mogul bragged about the Cessna, describing it as a \"very special feature within the Trump Aviation fleet.\"\n\nMoayedi is a big Republican party donor. He gave about $250,000 to a political committee for Trump's 2020 campaign and has also handsomely donated to other GOP candidates, including the RNC, Sen. Ted Cruz, and Nikki Haley.\n\nTrump's sale of his jet comes amid his struggle to stay afloat with his mounting legal bills. The billionaire politician has been embroiled in several legal battles - ranging from assault charges to hush money allegations - since he left office and has spent over $100 million in legal fees.\n\nAccording to Newsweek, a large portion of Trump's legal bills have been bankrolled by his supporters following donations made to his political action committee. However, that begs the question of how much longer the donations would suffice and whether they'll keep coming in just to pay his lawyers.\n\nIn March, Bloomberg reported that his campaign only had access to $6.8 million. He has since been fined several times, including a $10,000 charge for flouting the gag order in his ongoing hush money trial.\n\nTrump was slammed with a $454 million civil fraud judgment in February but was allowed to post a bond of $175 million in April after he appealed to lower the bond, with his lawyers noting that it was a \"practical impossibility\" to post the original fine.\n\nHe has also been indicted in several other federal cases, including alleged election interference in Georgia, attempting to overturn the 2020 U.S. presidential election, and mishandling of classified documents.\n\nThe end of the billionaire mogul's hush money trial is near. The Republican presidential hopeful is accused of falsifying company records to cover up an alleged $130k payment to former adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nAccording to CNN, lawyers are set to make their closing arguments in the case on Tuesday before the jury makes a verdict.\n\nIf convicted, Trump would become the first U.S. president in history to be convicted of a crime. His lawyers only need one of the seven men and five women jurors to stand firm against a unanimous guilty verdict for that possibility to be overturned.\n\nTrump's defense team is expected to double down on the credibility of the former president's associate, Michael Cohen, who admitted on the stand that he was a liar and benefitted financially from mainstream media targeting Trump at the time.\n\nHis lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, argued in court earlier this month that Cohen is a conflicted witness and that the case shouldn't go to the jury.\n\n\"He testified. And he lied under oath in this courtroom. And the consequences of that lie, if accepted by the jury, is a conviction, potentially,\" Blanche stated.\n\nLegal experts have also questioned Cohen's testimony, with many noting that it did not help the prosecutors' case much.\n\nWhile conversing for support from deep-pocketed individuals on May 14, Trump said that he'll crush Pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses if his reelection bid becomes successful.\n\nSpeaking to a group of predominantly Jewish donors, the former president called the protests against Israel's war on Gaza a \"radical revolution,\" adding that such demonstrations would be frowned upon if the group, which he joked were \"98 percent of my Jewish friends,\" helped him beat Biden.\n\n\"If you get me re-elected, we're going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years,\" Trump said, per the Washington Post.\n\n\"One thing I do is, any student that protests, I throw them out of the country,\" he added. \"You know, there are a lot of foreign students. As soon as they hear that, they're going to behave.\"", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Blast"}, "authors": [{"uri": "favour_adegoke@theblast.com", "name": "Favour

It is predictable what defendant Donald Trump will say. Either Trump will proclaim that the trial was a rigged Biden conspiracy, or he will say that the jury was a group of brilliant people who found him innocent.\n\nWhat Trump says won't matter. Anyone who has been watching and listening to Trump can probably script out in advance what Trump is going to say. The interesting reaction to the case will come from President Biden, who, according to Politico, will be delivering remarks from the White House after the verdict is announced:\n\nIf the jury convicts Trump, Biden's team will then argue that the result shows Trump is ill-suited for office and that it demonstrates the extremes to which the former president would go to win again. The campaign's social media team is considering leveraging the line of attack further, with discussions underway about referring to the ex-president online as \"Convicted Felon Donald Trump.\" His team is also preparing for a barrage of Republican and Trump attacks if the former president's acquitted or if there's a hung jury.\n\nTrump and his aides have convinced themselves that the candidate being a convicted felon will not matter to voters in the fall, which seems more like wishful thinking when the polling so far seems to indicate that a sizable portion of Independents and non-MAGA voters would definitely not be ok with voting for a convicted felon for president. Biden's remarks will be important for the nation after the verdict is announced.\n\nhttps://www.thedailypoliticususa.com/p/why-its-important-for-biden-to-speak\n\nPolitico article can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/24/biden-trump-trial-verdict-00159981", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Virtual_Corporations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Virtual Corporations", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

The goal is to wrap up early enough to make it hard for Steinglass to continue into another day -- all without annoying the jury, the source explained.\n\nWhat prosecutors are expected to say today: In their closing, Trump's team will revisit many of the arguments they made during the trial -- that allegedly falsified documents were not falsified because Michael Cohen was working as a lawyer to President Trump in 2017, according to the person familiar.\n\nThey will revisit documents to support this argument and how the $420,000 Cohen made in 2017 was similar to what he made on 2016 from working for Trump. Lawyers will also go back to the January 2017 email from former Trump CFO Allen Weisselberg to Cohen asking Trump's then-lawyer and fixer to send the agreement they had just discussed. They will also argue that if documents were falsified, it was Cohen who falsified them by lying about how much he was owed, according to the source.\n\nLawyers will also dispute this was part of a conspiracy to influence the election. They will steer clear of any arguments about political motivations for bringing this case, but might mention the case is old and let jurors draw their own conclusions.\n\nLastly, they will focus on how Cohen cannot be trusted, hitting all the obvious points, trying to personalize for the jury why nobody would want their personal freedom to rest on the word of Cohen.\n\nThe Trump team does not feel that Robert Costello's disastrous appearance on the witness stand last week will ultimately hurt their case or their arguments about Cohen.", "source": {"uri": "edition.cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN International"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_del_valle@edition.cnn.com", "name": "Lauren Del Valle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "cnn_s_kara_scannell@edition.cnn.com", "name": "CNN's Kara Scannell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Weisselberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allen Weisselberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Philosophy_of_Religion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Philosophy of Religion", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/240528094014-04-donald-trump-hush-money-trial-052824-crop-super-tease.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-01-", "textStart": 1276, "textEnd": 1288}], "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Biden will deliver this address in a \"White House setting\" to avoid the appearance of political motivation.\n\nAccording to reports, Biden's team will also leverage a guilty verdict to initiate more attacks against Trump ahead of the upcoming election.\n\nMAGA supporters are also angry at the report of Biden's plan to speak about Trump's trail, with many claiming that a verdict has been predetermined.\n\nBiden intends to speak about Trump's hush money trial once it concludes in the coming weeks. Such an act will see him break his vow of silence, as he has refrained from discussing the trial since it began.\n\nSources close to the president told Politico that the address will be held regardless of whether Trump is found guilty or acquitted or if a mistrial is declared due to a hung jury.\n\nWhile each scenario will necessitate a different statement, it is believed that the core of Biden's message would be \"that America's legal system worked and that the process should be respected\" at all times.\n\nIt is also understood that Biden intends to hold the address in a \"White House\" setting, not during one of his election campaigns. This is to avoid the appearance of using his opponent's situation to bolster his reelection bid.\n\nApart from the aforementioned details, it is unclear when exactly the address will be delivered and who will be invited to listen in.\n\nThe revelation that Biden intends to address Trump's hush money trial after the verdict has been met with a barrage of accusations from social media users, with many suggesting that POTUS might have \"orchestrated\" the charges against his opponent.\n\nOne user commented, \"Stayed silent? Maybe because he orchestrated it,\" while another remarked, \"Ya duh. It's his entire campaign plan. 'Prosecute my opponent.'\"\n\nAnother person wrote, \"Basically admitting the verdict is guaranteed. [Kangaroo] courts are here to stay. Fake trials. Fake elections. Fake economic data. Fake country.\"\n\nA fourth netizen remarked, \"Almost everyone, on both sides of the political spectrum, recognize that these flimsy cases are only happening because Trump is Biden's political opponent.\"\n\nOne more person noted, \"Is it a verdict when the entire trial is rigged? I don't see how you can have a verdict when the courtroom is so obviously rigged.\n\nInsiders also claim that Biden's social media team intends to launch an all-out attack on Trump if he is found guilty by the jury.\n\nAs part of their strategy, they will claim that a guilty verdict proves that he is \"ill-suited for office\" and that it shouldn't be surprising that the former president would pull similar moves just to win again.\n\nThey also plan to escalate their efforts by using the tag \"Convicted Felon Donald Trump\" in their statements about him, an act that could significantly damage his standing with voters.\n\nThe team has already taken shots at the former president on several occasions, with one of the most recent being a tweet accusing him of using Nazi talking points in a campaign video.\n\nThe video in question has since been taken down from Trump's Truth Social page following massive backlash from several social media users.\n\nThe prosecution and defense concluded their arguments in Trump's hush money trial earlier this week, paving the way for closing arguments to be held next Tuesday.\n\nThe prosecution will aim to provide jurors with a clear understanding of how the evidence and testimonies they have seen and heard prove that the charges are justified beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nTrump's lawyers, on the other hand, will likely try to discredit it, particularly focusing on the testimony of the former president's fixer, Michael Cohen.\n\nNext will be jury deliberations, with many speculating that a verdict will be reached in less than a week.\n\nA guilty conviction could potentially result in Trump being sentenced to jail for over a decade, as each of the 34 counts of charges of falsifying business records carries a maximum sentence of four years.\n\nIn such a scenario, the billionaire mogul is expected to appeal the judgment, as he has done on several occasions for similar verdicts.", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com",

The amount of backlash has only increased in the wake of the trial, leaving Daniels in a state of profound distress. Earlier, her lawyer claimed that despite the former president being on trial, it was his client who needed to wear a bulletproof vest every now and then. With Trump eyeing the White House for a second time, she fears that the situation will get even worse.\n\nSpeaking to The Mirror, Daniels said, \"Back in 2018, there was stuff like 'liar,' 'sl**,' 'gold digger.' This time around, it's different. It is direct threats. It is 'I'm going to come to your house to slit your throat.\" For unversed, the trial of Donald Trump is coming to a close. After almost five weeks of testimony, the prosecution and defence have wrapped up their cases in an epic hush-money trial. Closing arguments are set to begin on Tuesday, and then the jury will begin to weigh in.\n\nAlso read: Massiel Taveras speaks out on pushing Cannes guard incident, praises 'queen' Kelly Rowland; 'We need..\n\nShould the outcome turn unfavourable for Trump, he would mark a historic moment, as the first former US president to face a criminal conviction, particularly when he is currently campaigning for the next presidential election with a solid voter base. Trump's supporters are growing increasingly agitated, and abuse directed towards Daniels has heightened following reports suggesting a high likelihood of Trump facing charges.\n\n\"They're not even using bot accounts, they're using their real accounts,\" Daniel says, stressing that people are so angry because they think she played a role in bringing down Donald Trump that they have defended themselves and their behaviour as justifiable.\n\n\"I compare them to suicide bombers. They legitimately think that what they're doing is right. Those people who see me as a villain. \"It just makes me scratch my head and really question how they would want their daughters treated, or their sisters, or their mother.\" The adult star, alleged to have been paid $130,000 by Trump, further commented.\n\nThe case centres on 34 criminal charges accusing the former president of falsifying business records in connection with a hush money payment paid to Daniels in 2016. The payment, made by Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen, is believed to have been made to buy Daniels' silence about the alleged affair at a critical time in the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump denies any wrongdoing, including the alleged affairs. As the trial draws to a conclusion, her remarks will be highlighted in a brand-new television documentary titled Stormy, which will premiere in the UK on Tuesday night on Channel 5.\n\nAlso read: Jujutsu Kaisen faces backlash in Japan for controversial Chapter 261; 'hate seeing Yuta like...'\n\n\"I wanted to die.

Former tabloid boss David Pecker was called to testify.\n\nApril 23: Judge Juan Merchan held a Sandoval hearing for Trump's alleged gag order violations, but reserved his decision. Pecker continued his testimony.\n\nApril 25: While Trump sat in the Manhattan courtroom listening to Pecker's testimony, the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., heard arguments on the matter of his immunity in special counsel Jack Smith's election subversion case against him.\n\nApril 26: Pecker's direct questioning and cross-examination concluded. Trump's former longtime assistant Rhona Graff was called to testify briefly. Michael Cohen's former banker Gary Farro was then called to the stand.\n\nApril 30: Farro's testimony concluded. Prosecutors then called Dr. Robert Browning, the executive director of C-SPAN archives, and Philip Thompson who works for a court reporting company. Then, Keith Davidson, the former attorney for Daniels and McDougal, took the stand. Also, Merchan fined Trump $9,000 for violating a gag order.\n\nMay 2: Davidson's testimony concluded. Digital evidence analyst Douglas Daus was called to testify.\n\nMay 3: After Daus finished testifying, Georgia Longstreet, a paralegal at the district attorney's office, spoke about reviewing Trump's social media posts for this case. She was followed by Hope Hicks, once a longtime Trump aide. Her highly-anticipated testimony was a little less than three hours.\n\nMay 9: Stormy Daniels finished her testimony, with the defense trying to undermine her credibility by pointing out inconsistencies in her story on cross-examination.\n\nMay 10: Former White House aide Madeleine Westerhout's testimony concluded. Then prosecution called several custodial witnesses to the stand.\n\nMay 13: Former Trump attorney and the prosecution's key witness, Michael Cohen, started testifying.\n\nMay 14: The prosecution completed direct questioning of Cohen and Trump's defense began cross-examination.\n\nMay 16: Trump's defense grilled Cohen, putting into question a key 2016 October call and asking him about the times he lied under oath.\n\nMay 20: Cohen wrapped up his testimony and the prosecution rested its case. The defense called its first witness, Daniel Sitko, a paralegal for defense attorney Todd Blanche. After a short round of questioning, the defense called up Robert Costello, a lawyer with a connection to Cohen.\n\nMay 21: Costello's testimony concluded. Then the defense rested its case without calling Trump to take the stand.

And this case is not a slam dunk, which means that Donald Trump may very well not be convicted. Acquitted is the worst-case scenario for Democrats,\" CNN political correspondent Sara Murray said.\n\nThe jury will hear closing arguments on Tuesday in the criminal trial where Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.\n\nAn acquittal before the November election could boost Trump's chances over President Biden in the tight race, Murray predicted.\n\nTRUMP ATTORNEY CONCERNED JURY INSTRUCTIONS COULD BE BIASED TOWARD PROSECUTION: 'ZERO CONFIDENCE' IN THIS JUDGE\n\n\"Donald Trump gets to go out there and say, 'Joe Biden's prosecutors,' which, again, not true, 'came after me, his Department of Justice came after me, and they still didn't convict me. I'm still innocent,'\" Murray continued. \"I also think you could end up somewhere in this sort of muddy middle where you end up with a hung jury, a jury that cannot reach a verdict. And then this truly does just get kicked to the voters to decide.\"\n\nLegal analysts on MSNBC, however, were all but certain that Trump would be found guilty by the New York jury.\n\nAnti-Trump attorney George Conway claimed that the evidence was stacked against the former president and it would be hard for the jury not to convict.\n\n\"I don't think they can get an acquittal. I don't think they're going to get 12 votes unanimously to acquit him,\" Conway told MSNBC's Katie Phang on Saturday. \"I think their best shot, and that's what they're going to do, is hope that there's just some person on the jury who refuses to convict.\"\n\nBILL MAHER REVERSES COURSE AFTER PREVIOUSLY BASHING NY V. TRUMP CASE: ALVIN BRAGG WILL BE A 'RISING STAR'\n\nFormer US Acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal also argued the prosecution had a \"common sense\" case against the former president and predicted that it was highly likely he would be convicted.\n\n\"I suspect that it's going to be successful,\" he told host Jen Psaki on her Sunday MSNBC show.\n\nThe case stems from a hush money payment Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in 2016 over an alleged affair she had with him in 2006.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to all charges and maintains his innocence. He has also denied any affair with Daniels. The prosecution has tried to prove Trump authorized the payments and covered them up as part of a scheme to save his 2016 election hopes.\n\nDemocratic and Republican pollsters who spoke with Fox News Digital claimed a conviction or acquittal wasn't likely to make any difference with voters because Americans' beliefs about the two candidates are baked in.\n\nAccording to a recent Quinnipiac University survey, 62% of registered voters surveyed said a guilty verdict would make no difference to their vote for president. Fifteen percent said it would make them more likely to cast a ballot for Trump, and 21% said it would make them less likely to vote for the former president.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAmericans from all over the country gave a blunt assessment of the New York trial last week in remarks to Fox News Digital, going so far as to call the case a \"total farce.\"\n\n\"It sounds like it's a kangaroo court, actually,\" Brad, from Clovis, California said. \"I think it's a total farce.

Any two or more persons who conspire to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means and which conspiracy is acted upon by one or more of the parties thereto, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\"\n\nThe 34 records in this case consist of 11 checks cut to Michael Cohen, a former personal attorney to President Trump, and the corresponding vouchers and invoices. Prosecutors allege these payments, categorized as legal expenses, were reimbursement for money Mr. Cohen paid to Stephanie Clifford, better known as adult actress Stormy Daniels, as part of a scheme to influence the 2016 elections.\n\nOver several days, he outlined an agreement with Mr. Trump and collaboration with Mr. Cohen as AMI purchased two stories that Mr. Pecker believed would harm the 2016 Trump campaign. Neither of the two deals Mr. Pecker was involved in are related to the current charges, but prosecutors argued they provide important context and evidence toward a conspiracy.\n\nNext, longtime Trump assistant Rhona Graff testified, affirming that she had entered contact information for key people in the case into her contact management system, offering evidence that Mr. Trump was in touch with alleged co-conspirators.\n\nThen Gary Farro, a banker formerly with First Republic Bank, took the witness stand to affirm the creation of accounts for Mr. Cohen's LLCs, and confirm the $131,000 wire transfer.\n\nRobert Browning, executive director of C-SPAN's archives, took the witness stand to allow into evidence several video clips of President Trump campaigning. Philip Thompson, a regional director at Esquire Deposition Solutions, testified to the authenticity of a deposition transcript from another Trump case.\n\nLawyer Keith Davidson next testified, detailing his representation of Karen McDougal and later Ms. Clifford, and his dealings with Mr. Cohen to complete a settlement contract for Ms. Clifford. Several revealing texts were entered into evidence throughout his testimony, showing exchanges between Mr. Davidson and others.\n\nThen, two members of the district attorney's office were called to the witness stand. Forensic analyst Doug Daus had reviewed Mr. Cohen's cell phones, and through his testimony phone records were admitted into evidence. Paralegal Georgia Longstreet had reviewed President Trump's social media posts and several were entered into the record, including ones depicting a change in attitude toward Mr. Cohen.\n\nNext, Hope Hicks, former Trump campaign communications director testified and affirmed then-candidate Trump's schedule on key dates, allowing into evidence emails exchanged within the Trump campaign.\n\nJeffrey McConney, former Trump Organization comptroller, testified about his oversight of the process of accepting and processing Mr. Cohen's invoices, which Mr. McConney categorized as legal expenses, allowing into evidence email exchanges about the payments. Deb Tarasoff, a bookkeeper for The Trump Organization who worked under Mr. McConney, testified she processed these invoices, cutting the checks Mr. Trump ultimately signed.\n\nSally Franklin with Random House was then called to the witness stand to read into the record several excerpts from Trump books on life and business advice. Later during the trial, Tracey Menzies with Harper Collins read into the records from other Trump books.\n\nWhen Ms. Clifford took the witness stand, it was to a crowded courthouse. Ms. Clifford, whom the judge described as a \"difficult to control\" witness, gave salacious details in her testimony that led to the defense calling for a mistrial, which the judge denied on the basis that the issues could be resolved during cross-examination.\n\nNext, Trump Organization employee Rebecca Manochio testified that she shipped checks from Trump Tower to Washington for President Trump to sign in 2017. Former Oval Office Director of Operations Madeleine Westerhout testified that she saw President Trump signing checks, which had been sent through FedEx to bodyguard Keith Schiller and later herself.\n\nDaniel Dixon with AT&T and Jennie Tomalin with Verizon testified to the authenticity of phone records that were then entered into evidence. Paralegal Jaden Jarmell-Schneider, with the district attorney's office, created summary charts of records from Mr. Cohen's phone the prosecutors believed relevant to the case.\n\nFinally, Mr. Cohen testified as the final witness for the prosecutors, with testimony lasting a week.\n\nAlso unavailable was Allen Weisselberg, who is currently serving a five-month prison sentence for committing perjury in a separate civil fraud case that went to trial last fall. Mr. Weisselberg, the former CFO of The Trump Organization, came up with the idea to pay Mr. Cohen $420,000. Mr. Cohen could not testify as to why his reimbursement request for $130,000 was grossed up to $420,000, saying \"I just wanted to get my money back.\"\n\nThe defense is barred from making arguments that the case was timed for election interference, or that other agencies didn't want the case but the district attorney picked it up due to political pressure, relying on a tell-all book from a prosecutor who claimed he left the district attorney's office in protest when they didn't indict President Trump. President Trump is also prohibited from arguing that he relied on the advice of his then-attorney Mr. Cohen, as the defense opted not to use an advice-of-counsel defense.\n\n\"The other reason is because they have no case,\" President Trump said during the WABC interview. \"In other words, why testify when they have no case ... There's no crime.\"\n\nSummations from both sides are expected to last the whole day, and the judge said his instructions to the jury will take an hour.\n\nProsecutors will sum up their case by reminding jurors of what they believe is the most compelling evidence. But for the defense, especially having called only two witnesses, this will be a key moment to present their own narrative.\n\nDefense attorneys are expected to argue that nothing criminal occurred as the nondisclosure agreements are legal, as is the payment of an attorney for legal services, and that the promotion of a person in an election through lawful means is not a crime.\n\nOn May 21, the judge held a charge conference with attorneys, who debated over what language will be used to instruct jurors on the applicable laws and their interpretation.\n\nIn some cases where Justice Merchan rejected the attorneys' proposed language, he said they could argue those points at summations on May 28.\n\nThe charge conference allowed both parties to present to the judge arguments about why certain language would prejudice their side, allowing the judge to put together an instruction script that avoids such prejudice. However the judge delivers this interpretation of the law will inevitably influence the jury's decision.\n\nShould jurors be instructed that President Trump needed to have \"willfully\" concealed intent to defraud? Should the instructions include an example explaining that a legal expense might not classify as a campaign expenditure? Should jurors be told up front all the things prosecutors are not required to show?\n\nShould jurors be given an example of what it means \"to cause a false entry to be made?\n\nThe jurors will work on May 29, when previously they have taken Wednesdays off, so as to begin deliberations while closing arguments are still fresh in their minds.\n\nThe jury's job is to determine the facts of this case, and decide whether those actions violated the law.\n\nIf the 12 jurors don't come to a unanimous decision, the case will end in a mistrial.\n\nThere is no set time in which the jurors are required to return their verdict; a decision could be returned the same day, or even take weeks.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"},

The jurors, who are expected to get the case as soon as Wednesday, could reach a verdict in a matter of days.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 payment to an adult film star on the eve of the 2016 election to keep her quiet about an alleged affair. The case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg may hinge on whether jurors believe Trump had an intent to defraud as well as conceal other crimes, namely election law and tax violations.\n\nWhile the false-records charges are \"simple and easy to understand,\" turning those misdemeanors into felonies using New York election law along with other legal theories is more complicated, said Jennifer Rodgers, a former federal prosecutor.\n\nThe defense's closing argument will cast the issue as \"muddled, confusing, and full of reasonable doubt,\" Rodgers said, while prosecutors \"will want to cast their enhancement theory as easy to understand and well supported by overwhelming evidence.\"\n\n\"It will be a tale of two cases, for sure.\"\n\nThe case is one of four criminal prosecutions Trump is facing as he campaigns to return to the White House, including state and federal charges over his failed attempt to overturn the result of the 2020 election. The presumptive Republican nominee has denied wrongdoing in all the cases, claiming without evidence that they're part of a coordinated conspiracy against him by Democrats.\n\nThe defense and prosecution in the hush money trial rested their cases early last week, but Justice Juan Merchan delayed closing arguments so they would not be split from deliberations by the holiday weekend and previously scheduled days off.\n\nMerchan has said closing arguments are expected to last all day Tuesday and could bleed into Wednesday. The judge must also give jurors so-called charging instructions to explain the law and aid their deliberations. Merchan told jurors they'll start deliberating \"hopefully, at some point on Wednesday.\"\n\nClosing arguments are important for prosecutors because a small number of witnesses \"may have overshadowed the rest of the evidence,\" according to Rodgers.

The campaign's social media team is considering leveraging the line of attack further, with discussions underway about referring to the ex-president online as \"Convicted Felon Donald Trump.\"\n\nHis team is also preparing for a barrage of Republican and Trump attacks if the former president's acquitted or if there's a hung jury.\n\nClosing arguments are set for Tuesday and the jury could reach its decision as early as next week. And Biden will speak at some point after that -- a definitive decision on timing and setting has not yet been made -- no matter the outcome, whether it be a conviction, acquittal or hung jury. The message will be different for specific rulings, but the fundamental point will remain the same: That America's legal system worked and that the process should be respected.\n\n\"This is an important moment and the president first and foremost needs to stress that the American system works, even and especially in an election year,\" said one of the four people granted anonymity to discuss those deliberations. \"And in a measured way, it becomes part of his argument against Trump too: Do Americans really want this?\"\n\nThe Biden team's plans are still being deliberated and could change, the people familiar said. The White House and Biden campaign declined comment.\n\nThe first criminal prosecution of a former president has presented delicate politics for the president, especially as his son Hunter faces separate trials over the summer and fall on gun and tax charges. Biden has stayed away from Trump's trial to avoid perceptions of interference, even as some fellow Democrats have encouraged him to more aggressively spotlight the charges against Trump: that he made a hush money payment to cover up an affair with a porn star in violation of campaign finance laws.\n\nAnd even though the president will likely discuss a guilty verdict at times on the campaign trail, his team doesn't view even a conviction as likely to meaningfully change the trajectory of the campaign. Aides do not believe the trial has resonated widely with voters outside the Acela corridor.\n\nBut it could make a difference along the margins, and that may matter in a race expected to be extremely close.\n\n\"I don't think [Biden] needs to run to the briefing room to talk about this,\" said Jennifer Palmieri, former communications director for President Barack Obama. \"But, at some point, he should address the conviction saying that a jury of Donald Trump's peers have convicted him of a crime and it would do extraordinary damage to the standing of the United States and to the credibility of our democratic system for someone Americans found guilty of a crime to then be elected president.\"\n\nThe Biden team has long believed that too many Democratic voters have put their faith in a conviction to cripple Trump's changes and note that a guilty verdict does not inherently prevent the Republican from being elected. The campaign believes that the first presidential debate next month is a far more important moment to jostle the race, and that issues like abortion, inflation and a pair of foreign wars have far more resonance with voters.\n\nOut of more than 100 fundraising emails sent by Biden's campaign since the New York proceedings kicked off in mid-April, only two mentioned the word \"trial\" -- both messages that noted how good the trial had been for Trump's fundraising and asked Democratic donors for money to help Biden keep up.\n\nShould Trump avoid conviction, the president's aides are bracing for the former president to issue a barrage of claims about how he bested an investigation that he has claimed was orchestrated by Biden against him. That outcome could further fire up Trump's existing supporters.\n\nBut just as Biden is poised to break his near-silence on Trump's trial, many in Democratic politics are urging caution.\n\n\"I don't think it's important to rub it in,\" said Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.). \"I don't think anybody on our side should be reacting with glee. It just should be a tragedy that an American president has been convicted of real crimes.\"\n\nInterviews with a dozen of Biden's allies on the Hill and prominent Democratic strategists unaffiliated with but supportive of his campaign say the president and other Democrats should stay mum if Trump is found guilty -- in large part because they believe such a verdict will do the work for him.\n\nTrump's myriad crimes and ongoing legal troubles are well-known to voters, they argue -- and Biden and his surrogates don't need to remind them. The criminal conviction of a former president looking to return to power is a somber moment that shouldn't be nakedly wielded for political gain. Does Biden really want to be talking about a porn star or give fodder to Republican claims that he's weaponizing the government against a political opponent? And, some strategists say, speaking out on Trump's trial also carries the risk of drawing attention to the legal morass surrounding Hunter Biden.\n\n\"If he's convicted, he will be called by everyone in Democratic politics 'convicted felon Donald Trump,'\" said Matt Bennett, executive vice president for public affairs at the center-left think tank Third Way.\n\nBiden doesn't \"need to engage with it, because everyone else will,\" Bennett said. \"He is the only person who could in some ways lessen the political impact of this by getting involved, because Trump could then make the case that the verdict is political.\"\n\nNot all Democrats are in agreement with a hands-off strategy. After four years with Trump out of the White House, some Biden supporters worry that swing voters need to be reacquainted with the drama that engulfs the country when Trump is in power.\n\n\"At some point, people have to get real and say, 'You really want this man in the Oval Office? Do you really want him representing the people of this country?,'\" said Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.).\n\nBiden himself gave the directive a year ago that the entities that the White House controls, which includes the reelection campaign and the Democratic National Committee, were not to publicly discuss any of the criminal investigations into Trump, keeping a clear line between the West Wing and the Department of Justice.\n\nAnd beyond a few jokes, the Biden team has largely stuck to that edict. Aides said that Biden would continue to remain silent about the three ongoing investigations into Trump -- over his handling of classified documents, as well as election interference cases on the federal level and one in Georgia -- and those trials will likely not begin before voters cast their ballots.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

A verdict could come as soon as May 29.\n\nAhead of testimony from 22 witnesses, a full jury was sworn in to hear evidence and decide the guilt or innocence of Mr Trump. Twelve jurors and six alternates were seated following a jury selection process that lasted a week.\n\nMr Trump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records after he allegedly instructed then-fixer/now-witness for the prosecution Michael Cohen to pay off adult film star Stormy Daniels in the lead-up to the 2016 election to remain quiet about her claim that she had sex with Mr Trump in 2006. The former president denies the affair.\n\nDuring jury selection, a top priority for both sides was to root out potential \"stealth jurors\" - those who claim to be impartial but who hide their biases to get on a jury and possibly derail a trial.\n\nJurors are supposed to be impartial. A number of prospective candidates were dismissed from proceedings simply because they felt they could not be neutral while sitting in judgment of Mr Trump.\n\nSteve Duffy, from Trial Behavior Consulting, told The Independent that stealth jurors \"fully have an opinion ... but [are] trying to get on the jury\".\n\n\"I have no doubt that there are jurors in the pool on both sides, who really want to be on the jury [but] have a very strong opinion, either for or against him, and are deliberately not saying anything to try to get on,\" Mr Duffy said, during the jury selection process. \"The way you figure out who those people are is with background research, which ... both sides are undoubtedly doing.\"\n\nManhattan prosecutors posed several questions to jurors in the trial's first week. Among them - Can they follow the facts and the evidence and the judge's instructions, and can they remain fair and impartial, despite knowing the man sitting at the defense table in front of them is \"a former president and a current candidate for that office\"?\n\n\"We don't expect you to be living under a rock for the last eight years, or the last 30 years,\" Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass told a group on 16 April.\n\nBut focus on the evidence, he told them.\n\nMr Trump's attorneys largely had only one question: what do you think of him?\n\n\"It's important to President Trump that he gets a fair shake,\" lead defense attorney, Todd Blanche, told potential jurors.\n\n\"It's easy to read something off a sheet of paper and say, 'Yes, I'm going to be fair and impartial. What I want to do is test that a little bit,\" he said. \"We all know that every one of you knows President Trump, and you all know him in different ways, and you all have different views of him.\"\n\nNothing was off limits and there were no wrong answers, he said, and nothing would \"offend\" him.\n\nBut rather than face a disgusted panel of New Yorkers, Mr Blanche instead received promise after promise to treat Mr Trump as any other criminal defendant and to separate whatever they might feel about him personally from the case in front of them.\n\nMr Duffy told The Independent that a possible stealth juror would not be \"volunteering information, or honestly answering because they want to be on the jury\" to either convict or prevent a conviction.\n\nThe prosecution looked to remove any Trump supporters, and the defense tried to get rid of anyone who may be left-leaning, which was difficult considering that President Joe Biden got 84.5 percent of the vote in Manhattan in 2020.\n\n\"The parties do background research on jurors. That means looking at people's social media, and you can also look at any publicly available information, it's fair game,\" Mr Duffy said. \"Everybody involved in any sort of legal proceeding does it with jurors ... because if you don't, you're putting yourself in a huge competitive disadvantage. So they will know who's Democrat, who's Republican, if people have made really strong statements on social media.\"\n\nApart from social media posts, attorneys on both sides also look at criminal convictions and publicly available information on political donations of potential jurors.\n\n\"The faster the jury selection process works the harder it is to do that comprehensively,\" Mr Duffy said. \"I've had jury selection take 30 minutes in federal court from start to finish - we basically knew nothing about the people ... You could never do that in a case like this.\"\n\nWhile Mr Duffy said removing possible stealth jurors was a big focus for both sides, it was particularly important for the prosecution as a unanimous verdict is needed to avoid a mistrial. The Trump team needs only a single juror who refuses to convict.\n\n\"If you get one person who just says 'I don't care ... I will never vote to convict', then you're going to get a mistrial,\" he said. \"So rooting out ... what I would call a stealth juror, either for or against Trump is certainly a huge priority for both sides.\"\n\nHe added: \"In Trump's world, if he gets one of those people on the jury who just no matter what, will not vote to convict, then that's great because you won't get convicted. So rooting out anyone like that is imperative for the prosecution.\"\n\nNew York as a trial venue is tougher on Mr Trump when it comes to the jury pool compared to the area of South Florida where his classified documents case is being handled, \"because, in Manhattan, Trump's supporters stick out like a sore thumb,\" he said.\n\n\"The prosecution certainly has [fewer] problems than Trump does,\" Mr Duffy noted during the jury selection process, but he added that Mr Trump \"doesn't need to get acquitted\". He just needs a mistrial.\n\n\"Delay is often the defendant's best friend,\" he added. \"The percentage of jurors who are outwardly pro-Trump is going to be very low. But he only needs one.\"\n\nMr Duffy said that it's clear that the attorneys in Mr Trump's trial did their \"due diligence\" on the jurors.\n\n\"You see both sides directly ask jurors questions about their social media content. That's unusual, to directly confront jurors with that, but it's just a product of Donald Trump being such a ubiquitous presence in the public eye,\" he said.\n\n\"For sure,\" Mr Duffy said when asked if a stealth juror may be able to derail the trial. \"One of the jurors who was dismissed ... the prosecution was insinuating [that he] could be that kind of juror.\"\n\nThe prospective juror failed to disclose that he had torn down political signs and that his wife had been party to criminal corruption proceedings, the consultant noted.\n\n\"Any non-disclosure like that is going to be a red flag to an attorney,\" he added. \"The more off the grid you are, the easier it is to fly under the radar.\"\n\nHowever, the issue of stealth jurors \"cuts both ways\". There are people who may try to get on the jury and are \"hell-bent\" on convicting and there are those who'll refuse to convict regardless of what the trial may unearth, Mr Duffy said.\n\nPeople seeking \"celebrity\" may \"overlap\" with those looking to get on a jury to affect the outcome. \"Especially nowadays, certainly there are people who might want to do that because it's exciting to them or almost titillating to them to be involved,\" he added.\n\nBut the opposite issue exists as well.\n\n\"One of the jurors who was dismissed ... was someone who's terrified of being involved in this because they're afraid for their own safety,\" Mr Duffy said.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nPolling shows that a guilty verdict has some potential peril. But the strongest possibility is that voters will tune it out entirely in favor of economic issues, on which Trump scores far higher than President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump and his allies might not have to spin much.\n\nIn a recent Quinnipiac University nationwide poll, 62% of voters said a guilty verdict would not affect their vote in November. In comparison, just 21% said it would change their minds.\n\nA Cook Political Report polling partnership that surveyed seven battleground states found that 40% of voters said Trump's legal woes had no impact on their support or were unsure. Interestingly, the same survey found voters were broadly aware of Trump's problems when asked about the hush money trial, a previous civil fraud trial, and a separate civil trial that found the former president liable for sexually assaulting columnist E. Jean Carroll decades ago.\n\nVoters were also asked by the Cook partnership whether they were more concerned about Biden's age or Trump's temperament and legal issues. Narrowly (53% to 47%), they said Biden's age was more concerning.\n\nTrump has repeatedly shown he can rally Republicans to his side when his legal problems mount. But the average voter is not a GOP member of Congress nor responding to Trump's fundraising appeals.\n\nDespite Trump's and allies' efforts to cast doubt on the entire prosecution, some polls have found that Americans see legitimacy in the process. A Yahoo News/YouGov poll found that since last month, the hush money trial's approval has increased slightly; there's now a 12-point margin of approval (49%-37%).\n\nThat's not to say many voters are sympathetic to some of Trump's claims. A recent New York Times/Siena College poll of voters in key battleground states found that among registered voters, slightly more (49%) thought that the former president would not get a fair trial than those who did (45%).\n\nAnd if there is one clear takeaway from recent polling it's that the American people do think the former president did something wrong, even if he may not have broken the law. The same Yahoo poll found that a majority of Americans (52%) believe Trump falsified business records \" to conceal a hush money payment to a porn star\" -- the charge at the center of the Manhattan case. The Quinnipiac survey that showed voters may not be motivated by the trial also found that 46% of voters believe Trump did something illegal -- another 27% believe he did something unethical but not illegal.\n\nThose responses are in stark contrast to the GOP officials, led by Speaker Mike Johnson, who have slammed the trial as a sham.\n\nTrump has never been one to take setbacks lightly. He's under a gag order that does not allow him to criticize witnesses, the jury, or Merchan's daughter. Once the verdict is in, Trump can unleash whatever criticism he desires.\n\nIt's not hard to imagine that in responding to a potential guilty verdict Trump lashes out in a way that causes him more problems. His attacks on judges have historically triggered some of the rare instances when Republicans speak out more broadly against him. It was then-Speaker Paul Ryan who called Trump's suggestion that a federal judge couldn't fairly adjudicate a case because of his Mexican heritage the \"textbook definition\" of racism.\n\nBut Trump has constantly been able to count on almost all of his fellow Republicans. The FBI's decision to search Mar-a-Lago marked another point of vulnerability for Trump. Almost immediately, top GOP officials rallied to his side.\n\nThen-House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy proclaimed that the Justice Department had reached an \"intolerable state of weaponized politicization.\" Even former Vice President Mike Pence, who had been harshly critical of Trump, expressed concern about the FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe repeated shows of unity in the face of a new Trump indictment became so common that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis later complained that they \"distorted the primary.\"\n\nThe easiest prediction is that Trump's verdict will likely spawn a wave of donations. According to a Politico analysis, Trump's legal woes are among his most effective fundraising appeals. Trump had one of his best fundraising days since launching his presidential campaign on March 22 when the former president warned his followers that New York Attorney General Tish James might try to seize his assets in connection with a civil fraud verdict.\n\nDuring the Manhattan criminal trial, Trump has sent repeated fundraising appeals, including when Justice Juan Merchan found Trump in contempt for violating his gag order.\n\nThere are obvious costs to such efforts. Trump has relied on his network of political groups to help pay his legal bills. President Joe Biden mounted a significant early cash advantage. While other parts of Trump's orbit have been forced to come to the aid of Save America, the main outfit that has paid Trump's legal fees. According to its most recent filing, the leadership PAC owes over $1.1 million to Trump's lawyers. If the former president is found guilty, his almost certain appeal would likely further draw on this fund for support.\n\nStill, there may never be another day in American history like the one about to unfold.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brent_d_griffiths@businessinsider.com", "name": "Brent D.

It is expected that after the prosecution and defense wrap up, the jury will be given instructions by the judge and deliberations will commence. Trump faces 34 separate felony charges, and even just one could have a devastating impact on his ability to campaign. With the high risks, it's worth digging deep into what will occur over the coming days.\n\nWe spoke with Liberty Nation's Legal Affairs Editor Scott D. Cosenza Esq. to examine the procedures, the pitfalls, and the possibilities for defendant Trump.\n\nMark Angelides: So, what happens after Judge Juan Merchan gives jury instructions? Do the defense and prosecutorial teams sit back and wait for a verdict? Or is it likely that the Trump team will already be figuring out what appeals to make just in case?\n\nScott D. Cosenza, Esq: As Tom Petty wrote, the waiting is the hardest part. After the jury is charged, there is nothing left at that point except to wait for a call from the judge's chambers that a verdict is in. There is time enough to write appeal applications after the verdict.\n\nMark: And just to be clear, because of the type of charges being levied here, a guilty verdict on any of the 34 charges would require all 12 jurors to unanimously agree?\n\nScott: The possibilities on each count are guilty or not guilty, both requiring unanimity. If they cannot all agree, we'll have a hung jury.\n\nMark: I've noticed over the past weekend that news outlets seem desperate to make their respective cases that Trump is either clearly guilty or obviously innocent. We've seen bias on each side since the beginning, but it seems to me that various media groups are making a pitch directly to the jurors.\n\nIt appears that cable news hosts and guests were trying to outline precisely why someone might find guilt or innocence. And I wonder, if the jury had been sequestered and unable to watch the news, the media coverage would have been a little different. What are your thoughts on that?\n\nScott: I think it's more likely news outlets are chasing clicks and views rather than using their coverage to attempt to sway jurors. I'm not an optimist; I just think selfishness and greed trump their concern for a preferred trial outcome - no pun intended.\n\nMark: Why would the jury not be sequestered for such an important trial? And whose decision is that?\n\nScott: In New York, judges decide on sequestration. Given the cost to the state and the burden placed upon jurors, it's no wonder the trend is a decrease in sequestering. If I were the defendant in this trial, I wouldn't have wanted a jury that had been kept 36 nights away from their family and friends and their own beds. It is hard to believe they did not hear about Trump outside the courthouse during that time, but sequestering isn't necessarily a cure. Jurors almost certainly won't deliberate as long or passionately as they otherwise would if continued efforts mean denial of such comforts. I don't suggest that's a conscious choice - incentives work, which is why they are used everywhere, all the time. This is no different.\n\nMark: Walk me through the timeline of what comes next. And do we have any way of knowing how long each part might take?\n\nScott: Judge Merchan may still dismiss the charges. We are talking longshot odds, but it's possible. If he denies that defense motion, as we should expect he will, first up before the jury will be Trump's defense counsel, pleading his case for a not-guilty verdict. That should be over by late morning or early afternoon. Then, prosecutors will present their summation and urge jurors to bring in a finding of guilt. If it's late in the day, expect Merchan to wait until Wednesday to charge the jury or put the case in their hands. If not, then he would do so Tuesday afternoon, reading the jury instructions and sending them away to deliberate and arrive at a verdict.\n\nMark: Should Trump be found guilty, on even one count, will he be held or be free to go until sentencing? And how long a sentence would he get?\n\nScott: Upon conviction, we should expect Trump to remain free before sentencing and to see a hearing within 60 days. That is up to the judge. Trump may be restricted from leaving the city or state; however, that means another restriction damaging his ability to campaign for president. The range of punishment is from zero days to years, but I would expect probation, given the nature of the charges and Trump's not having prior convictions.\n\nSentencing concerns may have weighed heavily on Trump's decision not to testify. If he had testified and was then found guilty, Merchan could add time for perjury.\n\nMark: Do you have a prediction?\n\nScott: I expect at least one juror has Trump Derangement Syndrome and would vote to convict him of kidnapping the Lindbergh baby. If true, a not-guilty verdict on any count can be ruled out. Then the question becomes, is there a single juror on the panel who both sees reasonable doubt and will stand his or her ground to defend that verdict? It's hard to separate hope and wishful thinking from analysis here. Since reasonable doubt abounds in this case, anyone genuinely interested in the fair application of the law would hope that at least one such juror is present, here. But prosecutors' motivations seem clear beyond a shadow of a doubt.", "source": {"uri": "libertynation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liberty Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liberty_nation_authors@libertynation.com", "name": "Liberty Nation Authors", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosenza", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cosenza"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cosenza"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Petty", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Petty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_sequestration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury sequestration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_instructions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury instructions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outline (list)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seven deadly sins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_derangement_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trump derangement syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindbergh_kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lindbergh kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defense (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.libertynation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2147861970-Donald-Trump-trial.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 86, "textEnd": 92}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Biden will deliver this speech in the \"White House setting\" to avoid any appearance of political motivation.\n\nThere are reports that Biden's team will take advantage of a guilty verdict to launch more attacks on Trump ahead of the next election.\n\nMAGA supporters are also angry over the announcement of Biden's plans to speak about Trump's trial, with many saying a verdict has been predetermined.\n\nJoe Biden intends to speak about the Hush Money trial in a 'White House setting'\n\nMEGA\n\nBiden plans to speak about Trump's secret trial once it is completed in the coming weeks. Such an act will see him break his vow of silence, as he has refrained from discussing the trial from the start.\n\nSources close to the president told Politico that the speech would take place whether Trump is convicted or acquitted or the trial is declared a mistrial due to a hung jury.\n\nAlthough each scenario will require a different statement, it is believed that the core of Biden's message would be \"that the American legal system works and the process must be respected\" at all times.\n\nIt is also understood that Biden intends to deliver his speech in the context of the \"White House\", and not during one of his election campaigns. This is to avoid giving the impression of using your opponent's situation to strengthen your candidacy for re-election.\n\nAside from the details mentioned above, it is unclear when the speech will be delivered and who will be invited to listen to it.\n\nMAGA Claims Joe Biden \"Orchestrated\" Hush Money Lawsuit\n\nMEGA\n\nThe revelation that Biden intends to respond to Trump's secret trial after the verdict has been met with a barrage of accusations from social media users, with many suggesting POTUS may have \"orchestrated\" the accusations against his opponent.\n\nOne user commented: \"Stayed silent? Maybe because he orchestrated it,\" while another remarked: \"Yeah, duh. That's his entire campaign plan. \"Pursue my opponent. \"\n\nAnother person wrote: \"Basically, admitting the verdict is guaranteed. [Kangaroo] the courts are here to stay. False trials. Fake elections. False economic data. Fake country.\"\n\nA fourth netizen remarked, \"Almost everyone on both sides of the political spectrum agrees that these flimsy cases are only happening because Trump is Biden's political opponent.\" \"\n\nAnother person noted: \"Is this a verdict when the whole trial is rigged? I don't see how anyone can get a verdict when the courtroom is so obviously rigged.\n\nJoe Biden's campaign team could call Donald Trump a 'convicted felon' if he is found guilty\n\nMEGA\n\nInsiders also claim that Biden's social media team intends to launch an all-out attack on Trump if he is found guilty by the jury.\n\nAs part of their strategy, they will argue that a guilty verdict proves he is \"unfit for office\" and that it should not be surprising if the former president would take similar steps to win again.\n\nThey also plan to step up their efforts by using the label \"Convicted Felon Donald Trump\" in their statements about him, an act that could significantly damage his reputation with voters.\n\nThe team has already taken shots at the former president several times, one of the most recent being a tweet accusing him of using Nazi arguments in a campaign video.\n\nThe video in question has since been removed from Trump's Truth Social page following massive backlash from several social media users.\n\nDonald Trump's Hush Money trial set to continue with closing arguments\n\nMEGA\n\nThe prosecution and defense concluded their arguments in Trump's secret trial earlier this week, paving the way for closing arguments next Tuesday.\n\nThe prosecution will aim to provide jurors with a clear understanding of how the evidence and testimony they have seen and heard proves the charges are justified beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nOn the other hand, Trump's lawyers will likely attempt to discredit him, focusing particularly on the testimony of the former president's confidant, Michael Cohen.\n\nNext comes jury deliberations, many of which believe a verdict will be reached in less than a week.\n\nDonald Trump could face more than 10 years in prison if convicted\n\nMEGA\n\nA conviction could potentially result in Trump being sentenced to more than a decade in prison, as each of the 34 counts of falsifying business records carries a maximum sentence of four years.\n\nIn such a scenario, the billionaire tycoon would have to appeal the judgment, as he has done several times for similar verdicts.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car

On Monday, CNN's Jim Acosta tried to give viewers a sense of what they could expect -- including some betting odds.\n\nIn a conversation with CNN legal analyst Norm Eisen and former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti, Acosta laid out some possible outcomes for the first former president to stand trial on criminal charges. Eisen first summed up what the jury would be considering as they entered deliberation:\n\n[I]n terms of the arguments, battle will be joined around three issues. One: Can the jury believe the critical testimony of Michael Cohen, as it's corroborated and supported by a mountain of evidence? In a sense, the prosecution's entire work across 20 days of trial was to corroborate Cohen. Two: Can the jury find that Donald Trump, beyond a reasonable doubt, intentionally made that hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, 2016, in order to influence his federal campaign after Access Hollywood catastrophe, another sex scandal. Issue three: Did Trump participate in covering that up by creating false documents, Jim, including nine checks with his own signature on them!\n\nWhile Eisen seemed to have come to his own conclusion, Mariotti agreed that things were not looking good for Team Trump:\n\nAcosta: Renato, is this going to come down to Michael Cohen? What do you think?\n\nMariotti: Certainly, that's a big part of it. I mean, I think realistically this is a case that could have been winnable by the defense if they pursued a different strategy, if they focused on the areas where Michael Cohen was not as corroborated. But they really haven't had a focused presentation. They haven't tried to focus the the jury on the issues as succinctly as Norm just put them. They've really been all over the place, you know, scorched earth, attacking not just Michael Cohen but Stormy Daniels, contesting everything. The fact of an encounter in a hotel room, the fact of the hush money payments, and so on.\n\nI think that we're going to get more of that scorched earth, \"attack everything\" approach in the closing arguments. And if that's the case, I do think there's going to be a conviction here. Really, there needs to be an entirely different approach. And I'm not sure that Donald Trump's willing to let his defense attorneys pursue a strategy that has a chance of winning in this case.\n\nSo, what about the odds?

The president's comments will focus on the integrity of the U.S. legal system.\n\nWhat Happened: According to Politico, Biden plans to address the outcome of Trump's Manhattan criminal trial from the White House.\n\nThe 81-year-old president will deliver remarks regardless of whether the 77-year-old former president is convicted, acquitted, or if the jury is deadlocked, reports Politico, citing four people familiar with internal deliberations.\n\n\"This is an important moment, and the president first and foremost needs to stress that the American system works, even and especially in an election year,\" one of the four people told the outlet, while requesting anonymity.\n\n\"And in a measured way, it becomes part of his argument against Trump too: Do Americans really want this?\" he added.\n\nAlso Read: Here's What To Expect If Donald Trump Is Convicted As Jury Deliberations Begin Next Week\n\nClosing arguments in Trump's trial over alleged hush-money payments to Stormy Daniels are set to begin on Tuesday.\n\nThe jury could reach a verdict as early as next week. Multiple sources told Politico that the exact timing and setting of Biden's speech have not been finalized, but it will be delivered from the White House to avoid being perceived as political.\n\nThe Biden campaign is also preparing for the verdict, considering referring to Trump as \"Convicted Felon Donald Trump\" on social media if he is found guilty, reported the outlet. It will argue that a conviction shows the former president is unfit for office and highlights just how far he would go to win again.\n\nWhy It Matters: The trial's outcome could have significant implications for the 2024 presidential election. A recent poll revealed that If Trump were to be found guilty in the hush-money case, 53% said the verdict would not impact their stance, 23% said they would be more likely to vote for him and 25% said they would be less likely to vote for him.\n\nIn addition, a CBS News poll published last week noted that 56% of Americans believe Trump is either definitely or probably guilty of falsifying business records to conceal the hush-money payment.\n\nThis trial and its verdict could further complicate the political landscape as both Trump and Biden prepare for the upcoming election.\n\nNow Read: Donald Trump Outmaneuvered Manhattan DA By Gaining Access To Michael Cohen's Emails.

Still, few of the more than 25 million privately held companies in the U.S. are run in as slipshod a manner as these various stories have shown.\"\n\nNoting that whether Donald Trump is convicted or walks away a free man, the analyst predicted the hush money trial will leave the myth of Trump the successful businessman damaged, with Beckwith writing, \"Whatever else it accomplishes, the hush money trial has again pulled back the curtain to reveal the real boardroom, and it's not a pretty sight.\"", "source": {"uri": "rawstory.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Raw Story"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_Story", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raw Story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_State_University", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego State University"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privately_held_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privately held company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/donald-trump-jr-donald-trump-and-ivanka-trump-afp.jpg?id=29376623&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C69%2C0%2C69", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

Trump's hush-money trial is nearing its end after weeks of arguments and testimonies as closing arguments are slated for Tuesday.\n\n\"This is an important moment and the president first and foremost needs to stress that the American system works, even and especially in an election year,\" said one of the four people familiar with internal discussions who was granted anonymity. \"And in a measured way, it becomes part of his argument against Trump too: Do Americans really want this?\"\n\nThe former president is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to his alleged hush-money payments to porn actress Stormy Daniels. Trump has denied the charges brought against him by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. The leftist district attorney charged Trump years after federal prosecutors ended their investigation into Trump's alleged hush-money payments without bringing any charges in 2019.\n\nPOLITICO reported that if the jury finds Trump guilty, Biden's team will argue that the former president is not suited to be elected to another term. Biden is still planning on addressing the verdict even if the jury acquits his political rival, according to the people familiar with the discussions, but they added that those plans could change.\n\nIf Trump makes it past the Manhattan criminal trial without being convicted, Biden's team is reportedly preparing for a barrage of outrage from Trump, his supporters, and other potential voters who have argued that the legal system is being used to target the presidential candidate to keep him off the campaign trail.\n\nEarly on Saturday morning, Trump took to his social media platform Truth Social to blast Biden and Bragg, arguing that the Manhattan criminal trial is \"election interference.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP\n\n\"The City of New York's D.A., Alvin Bragg, is trying to prosecute a Federal case, which cannot be done, and where there is NO CRIME, that has been turned down by everyone, including the Federal Elections Commission, SDNY, the D.A.'s Office, and Bragg himself - Until I announced that I was running for President,\" Trump wrote. \"This case could have been brought 7 years ago, but wasn't.

More than three years after he begrudgingly left office, after numerous investigations into his behavior and after more than a month in a New York City courtroom, former President Donald Trump will soon reach the end of a criminal trial. All that's left are summations from the prosecution and defense, and then 12 New Yorkers will be given their instructions and sent to make one of the most monumental decisions in the history of our country.\n\nWe have no way of knowing how long jurors will deliberate. Reporters and legal analysts have scoured jurors' expressions and gestures, but even so, it's impossible to know the initial thoughts and feelings each person will take into the jury room and how those thoughts and feelings might change if challenged. What I sense, though, is that whatever happens, America is in no way ready for the new chapter that a verdict -- or lack thereof -- in Trump's case will usher in.\n\nThere are at least three likely options that await us on the other side of deliberations. Trump could be convicted of falsifying business documents to cover up hush money payments, made in the interest of affecting the 2016 presidential election's outcome. The jury could conclude the prosecution didn't make its case and fully acquit him. Or the jury could report that they're deadlocked, causing Judge Juan Merchan to declare a mistrial.\n\nAssuming there is a verdict, once the foreperson has announced the jury's decision, any prior assumptions about the 2024 presidential race will need to be recalculated. Polls taken since Trump was first indicted have only been able to ask respondents to consider hypotheticals. A survey conducted in March by Politico Magazine and Ipsos found that a conviction could cost Trump just over a third of independents in the fall. Likewise, a February poll from NBC News showed a conviction in the New York trial taking a major chunk of Trump's support from independents and prompting a major swing from 18- to 34-year-olds to support President Joe Biden over Trump. And an ABC News/Ipsos survey conducted in late April found that 20% of Trump supporters polled would \"either reconsider their support (16%) or withdraw it (4%)\" if he's convicted.\n\nWe are now finally moving away from possibility to hard and fast reality, which may look very different than the predictions based on polling. And encouraging as those statistics may have been for Democrats, they still left unanswered some important questions. None of the polls above asked voters how an acquittal would affect their support for the former president, something that remains a possibility. Also, there's no guarantee that the number of people who would change their vote would be enough to shift the election's outcome in any given state. Here's how NBC News caveated its findings, which showed an overall swing toward Biden in the face of a conviction but still within the margin of error:\n\nBiden has chosen to stay silent about Trump's legal troubles as the cases have unfolded, but his campaign is now preparing to use a guilty verdict to its advantage, NBC News recently reported, internally debating whether to brand him a \"convicted felon\" in its messaging. Whatever the result, one person familiar with the discussions told NBC News the campaign will stress to voters that \"Donald Trump's legal troubles are not going to keep him out of the White House. Only one thing will do that: voting this November for Joe Biden.\" If there's an acquittal, though, it's hard to say whether another instance of Trump seeming immune to accountability would encourage or discourage Democrats from turning out.\n\nDepending on where the jury lands, Trump, as he always has, will either praise or denounce the system. A conviction in a state court would be something he couldn't undo even if he's elected president again. It would be yet another asterisk next to his name, one more humiliation to add to the list. While it would be another grievance for him to seek revenge against, an appeal would be yet another costly distraction to a campaign already hemorrhaging money on his legal fees. And yet his supporters, following the lead of the spineless Republicans who have showed up at court to buoy him, may well shrug and cast their votes for a convicted criminal.\n\nAn acquittal, though, will be another supposed \"total exoneration\" -- and this time it would be true. (Of course, a process he otherwise claims to be rigged that still rules in his favor has proven its merit in his mind.) It wouldn't be surprising for his campaign to even spin a hung jury as a victory. I can already picture one of his many emails crowing about how Crooked Joe Biden (who had nothing to do with the prosecution) couldn't manage to take him down in court.

The second column will appear tomorrow.\n\nHow far out on a limb is Judge Juan Merchan willing to go to help Manhattan's elected progressive Democratic district attorney, Alvin Bragg, convict former president Donald Trump based on inadmissible evidence?\n\nVery far.\n\nAs I'll discuss in this column and a second one tomorrow, the inadmissible evidence in question consists of (a) guilty pleas by Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to two Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) felonies in a case brought against him by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York (SDNY); and (b) a non-prosecution agreement that former American Media Inc. CEO David Pecker -- Trump's longtime friend, who controlled the National Enquirer -- entered into with the Justice Department because he feared being indicted under FECA. (Relatedly, AMI agreed to pay a fine to the FEC.)\n\nTo avoid too much redundancy, let's focus on Cohen's guilty pleas, which trigger the same legal objections as the non-prosecution agreement and the fine. The two pleas relate to non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) that Cohen helped obtain for Trump's benefit during the 2016 presidential campaign in connection with two women -- Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels -- who claimed to have had extramarital affairs with Trump in 2006. McDougal, a former Playboy model, was paid $150,000 by the National Enquirer, pursuant to an arrangement Cohen, then a lawyer for Trump and the Trump Organization, made with Pecker. Subsequently, when Pecker balked at paying Stormy Daniels (a porn star whose real name is Stephanie Clifford), Cohen paid for that NDA himself -- only after, he claims, Trump promised that he'd be reimbursed, which he was in monthly installments in 2017.\n\nWe have been over why the guilty pleas are worthless (see, e.g., here and here). In my opinion, as a former SDNY prosecutor who worked there for nearly 20 years -- and was a supervisor there for over a decade -- they are worthless as evidence. But you needn't agree with me on that because it is incontestable that they are worthless -- or at least should be -- as a matter of law.\n\nI'll start by reiterating why they are worthless as evidence. NDAs are technically not campaign expenditures under FECA. The category of actionable campaign expenditures is limited to expenditures that would not exist but for the campaign -- e.g., polling or get-out-the-vote costs. The fact that the campaign motivates an expenditure is irrelevant if the expenditure is not within this narrow category.\n\nTo be more concrete, Trump was (and is) a married celebrity billionaire and businessman. It so happened that, in 2016, Trump ran for president, which gave Daniels leverage to pressure him to pay for her silence. Yet, there are many other contexts -- wholly apart from politics -- in which Daniels could have sought to pressure him into paying for an NDA. Hypothetically, Trump could have been in the running for a big TV gig or real-estate project, which could have given Daniels leverage. Moreover, Trump could have been concerned that his wife would divorce him and his family would be humiliated if the Stormy fling became public. In sum, a long-ago (alleged) sexual escapade created a vulnerability that, for many reasons, Trump might eventually have to attempt to conceal by buying Daniels' silence; the fact that the campaign turned out to be the leverage point that Daniels exploited did not make the payment a FECA campaign expenditure.\n\nThis is what Bradley Smith, a former FEC commissioner and perhaps the nation's top legal expert on FECA, would have explained to the jury. Judge Merchan, however, did not allow the defense to elicit Smith's testimony -- although Merchan has let both Cohen and Pecker, who have no expertise in this esoteric area of law, opine on the subject. The explanation Smith would have given is bolstered by the determinations of the Justice Department and the FEC, the two federal entities given exclusive enforcement jurisdiction over federal election law by Congress, that Trump should not be indicted either criminally or civilly -- determinations that Merchan has kept from the jury despite permitting extensive evidence that the two federal agencies decided to take action against Cohen and Pecker.\n\nSo the guilty pleas fail the basic test of probative value: Cohen's claim that he was guilty is wrong. But there is much more to it than that. The SDNY had Cohen over a barrel: He was caught in bank-fraud and tax-evasion offenses involving over $4 million -- crimes that had nothing to do with Trump. He was facing years in prison over these crimes, and he was desperate to avoid that fate. The problem: His only way to avoid prison would be to convince the SDNY to give him a cooperation agreement. (Under federal sentencing law, the prosecutor can file a \"substantial assistance\" motion with the court, which allows the judge to impose a no-incarceration term even if the cooperating defendant is otherwise looking at many years of imprisonment.) Cohen had no one against whom to provide cooperation in connection with his crimes because he was the principal culprit. What the SDNY was interested in was making a case against Trump; but Cohen had nothing incriminating on the then-president . . . unless the two NDAs were deceptively framed as FECA crimes.\n\nErgo, to try to earn a cooperation agreement, Cohen pled guilty in 2018 to two felony FECA charges in addition to the tax and bank charges. It sounds counterintuitive that admitting guilt to additional \"crimes\" could benefit a defendant, but in this instance, Cohen hoped it would -- the FECA guilty pleas were to be building blocks of a FECA case against Trump; if such a case were indicted, the SDNY would make the substantial-assistance motion for Cohen, and he could escape imprisonment for his other crimes.\n\nThe pleas were also a no-lose proposition for the SDNY: Because Cohen was pleading guilty rather than going to trial, the federal prosecutors would never have to prove the campaign-law offenses in court unless they eventually charged Trump. And because defendants who plead guilty waive their right to appeal, SDNY prosecutors would never have to defend the pleas' inadequate legal basis before the Second Circuit appellate court. The SDNY shrewdly calculated that Judge William Pauley -- a Clinton appointee who had been a lawyer for New York State and had no expertise in federal campaign law -- would not question the legal basis for the guilty pleas based on the NDAs. (Judge Pauley died of cancer in 2021.)\n\nIn the end, Cohen's quest for a cooperation agreement predictably cratered. The SDNY determined that he was not a credible witness. Beyond that, he is a convicted perjurer, having pled guilty in connection with lies he told during the Mueller probe. And to repeat, the Justice Department determined that the NDAs were not a sound basis for a prosecution of Trump, and the FEC concluded that they were not even sufficient for a civil lawsuit against Trump. (Civil suits have a lower burden of proof than criminal charges.) Indeed, if the NDAs had been campaign expenditures, Trump could have paid for them with campaign funds -- although, had he done so, does anyone doubt that Bragg would have indicted him for falsifying business records to conceal his use of campaign funds to pay personal expenses?\n\nFor all those reasons, then -- the insufficiency of the NDAs as legally cognizable campaign expenditures, Cohen's motivation to say he was guilty in order to try to convince the SDNY to sign him up as a cooperator, the SDNY's awareness that Cohen's supposed campaign-law crimes would never have to be defended in court, and the DOJ and FEC decisions, even under the Biden administration, not to proceed against Trump -- it is my opinion as an experienced former SDNY prosecutor that Cohen's guilty pleas are worthless as evidence. That is to say, in the parlance of evidentiary rules, the probative value of the guilty pleas is negligible and thus substantially outweighed by the high probability of their wasting time, confusing the jury, and, most importantly, unfairly prejudicing the jurors against the accused.\n\nNaturally, I hope you are persuaded by my argument about evidentiary worthlessness. But remember, it doesn't matter if you're not. As a matter of law, Cohen's guilty pleas are inadmissible as evidence against Trump. No one disputes this. Even Judge Merchan and Bragg's prosecutors have paid lip-service to this rudimentary principle. They have thus pretended that Cohen's federal-election-law guilty pleas are relevant only on the issue of Cohen's credibility.\n\nThat, you should understand, is the essence of their scheme to get Trump convicted. In a case in which Bragg accuses Trump of conspiring with Cohen to violate federal election law, it is outrageous that Merchan permitted the jury to be told about Cohen's guilty pleas -- in effect, guilty pleas to the very \"crime\" that Bragg has manufactured in order to prosecute Trump. The purpose of informing the jury about a government witness's prior crimes and bad acts is to benefit the defendant. But in this instance, the defendant asked to suppress this information because, in terms of Cohen's credibility, it adds nothing. Everyone knew the jury was going to learn that Cohen is a convicted perjurer and fraudster, a serial liar, and a disbarred lawyer who needs Trump to be convicted lest his opportunities to cash in evaporate. There was no reason to alert the jury to Cohen's campaign-law guilty pleas because they do not move the needle at all in terms of weighing what passes for Cohen's credibility.\n\nThe defense did not want these guilty pleas to be any part of the case. Merchan knew this was a sound position; but without Cohen's guilty pleas -- and, relatedly, Pecker's entry into a non-prosecution agreement, along with AMI's agreement to pay a fine to the FEC -- Bragg would have nothing to tell the jury about FECA crimes.\n\nBragg alleges that Trump falsified his business records in 2017 to conceal FECA violations. Yet, there is no evidence that Trump was even thinking about FECA, much less willfully violating FECA, when Daniels was paid in 2016 and when Cohen was reimbursed in 2017. Bragg is trying to fill this gaping hole in his case using the inadmissible evidence -- i.e., by telling the jury again and again and again that Cohen pled guilty to committing FECA crimes at Trump's direction, and that Pecker feared being prosecuted (though he was not) for committing a FECA crime for Trump's benefit. Merchan is letting the district attorney get away with this.\n\nHere's how the scheme works. Bragg's prosecutors weave the guilty pleas into the testimony, presenting them as a factual narrative that supposedly establishes Trump's guilt as an accomplice. Then, after this story has been seared into the jurors' minds, Merchan gives a bland instruction that the guilty pleas are not admissible against Trump. And because Merchan is the judge and has already ruled against the defense objections, no one gets to stand up and say: If the pleas are not admissible against Trump, then why on earth are you letting Cohen talk about them as if they show Trump is guilty?\n\nThe ruse here would be hilarious if it weren't so cynical. Merchan knows the evidence is inadmissible against Trump, but he is purporting to admit it because it is relevant to the credibility of Cohen and Pecker. Of course, the only party in the case that has an interest in impeaching the credibility of Cohen and Pecker is the defense. Again though, Team Trump did not want the inadmissible evidence for that purpose. Even without the FECA guilty pleas and non-prosecution agreement, Trump's lawyers had plenty of impeachment material; they wanted this FECA information out of the case because, patently, it is unfairly prejudicial to Trump and certain to sow jury confusion.\n\nIt is the prosecutors who want Cohen's guilty pleas and Pecker's non-prosecution agreement in the case. But they don't want it to impeach their own witnesses; they want the jury to believe their witnesses. No, they have injected the FECA pleas and non-prosecution agreement into the case for the precise reason why a competent, non-biased judge would exclude that information from the case: to persuade the jury that because Cohen and Pecker believe they violated FECA, Trump must have violated FECA.\n\nMerchan is preposterously rationalizing that \"witness credibility\" justifies admitting the controversial evidence because, in general, a witness may be impeached with prior crimes and acts that are pertinent to honesty. The judge well knows, however, that the general rule does not apply when the prior crimes add little or nothing to the credibility assessment but the jury could easily be misled into relying on the witnesses' guilty pleas to convict the defendant. Merchan also knew the prosecutors were not eliciting Cohen's FECA guilty pleas and Pecker's FECA non-prosecution agreement so the jury could weigh the credibility of those witnesses. It could not be more apparent that Bragg's team is using this evidence to establish Trump's guilt. Merchan is knowingly and intentionally letting them do it.\n\nAs we'll see tomorrow in looking at how the testimony actually played out in court, the collaboration between the prosecutors and the judge is a lot easier to comprehend than anything Bragg has charged against Trump.", "source": {"uri": "ruthfullyyours.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ruthfullyyours.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ruth_king@ruthfullyyours.com", "name": "Ruth King", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pecker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Pecker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admissible_evidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Admissible evidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Non-disclosure agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Enquirer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Enquirer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Election Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Southern District of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Karen McDougal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A360media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A360media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Election_Campaign_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Election Campaign Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Pauley_III", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William H.

They mined his books for examples of how he micromanaged the Trump Organization, how he was motivated by revenge, and how he saw sexual potential in encounters with women.\n\nIn so doing they sought to show the jury that he monitored every cent coming in and out of his business, bolstering their case that he must have known that hush money payments to Stormy Daniels were being hidden as legal expenses. Trump denied 34 charges of falsifying business records.\n\nHis defense team tried to show he was a busy executive who left handling invoices, ledger entries and check cutting to lower level managers. His own books offered a different image of Trump. In 'Trump: Think Like a Billionaire,' he makes a virtue of pennypinching, even describing how when Spy magazine ran a feature called 'Who is the cheapest millionaire' he was sent a check for 50 cents as a test.\n\nHe said he was proud that the Trump Organization deposited it. 'They may call that cheap; I call it watching the bottom line,' he wrote. 'Every dollar counts in business, and for that matter every dime. Penny-pinching? 'You bet. I'm all for it.'\n\nAlthough many of the headlines have focused on Trump's alleged affair with Stormy Daniels, the meat of the case against him is more prosaic: The 34 invoices, ledger entries and checks that were labeled as legal expenses, rather than a reimbursement to fixer Michael Cohen for paying off Stormy Daniels. And his books suggest Trump is an executive with a meticulous approach to money.\n\n'As I said before, I always sign my checks, so I know where my money's going,' he wrote in \"Trump: Think Like a Billionaire.\" 'In the same spirit, I also always try to read my bills to make sure I'm not being overcharged.' Jurors heard the text read aloud by Sally Franklin, a witness who is an executive and editor at Penguin Random House.\n\nThroughout, Trump hammers the point that he stays on top of every financial aspect of his business. 'If you don't know every aspect of what you're doing, down to the paper clips, you're setting yourself up for some unwelcome surprises,' he wrote. There were two other themes to the excerpts.\n\n'All the women on \"The Apprentice\" flirted with me -- consciously or unconsciously,' he wrote in Trump: How to Get Rich,' also published in 2004. 'That's to be expected. 'A sexual dynamic is always present between people, unless you are asexual.' And another passage from the same book laid out how he views his enemies.\n\n'For many years I've said that if someone screws you, screw them back,' he wrote.

After more than a year, and more obstructive bullsh*t than any judge or interested viewers should have to tolerate, we're fiinally at ground zero. On Tuesday the two sides will make their closing arguments, and Judge Merchan plans to hand the case to the jury to start deliberating on Wednesday. Which makes perfect sense, since the jury is going to be locked up in the deliberation room, so he can still conduct his normal Wednesday mental health calendar.\n\nI must admit, New York is a bit different in how they handle closing arguments than in the states I've lived in, Illinois and Nevada, as well as California, with which I have documentary experience. In those states, the prosecution makes it's closing argument, followed by the defense making their closing argument. But since the prosecution has the burden of proof, they get one more bite at the apple, with their final summation.\n\nNew York cuts out the middleman. On Tuesday the defense will lead off with it's closing argument, followed by the prosecution with theirs. Personally, I like the other way better. The prosecution leading off gives the defense a chance to see what they're arguing, and respond to it in their closing argument. The prosecution still gets the last whack, but in New York the defense is flying blind, trying to guess what the prosecution will try to highlight. Just a point of trivia interest. In the Manson trial, prosecutor Vince Bugliosi took nine hours over two days to present his final summation.\n\nBut what do we look for? Well, in the defense's closing argument, Trump lead attorney will throw the final shovel of dirt over Trump's grave, simple because there's nothing else he can do. The old legal adage is, If the facts are against you, argue the law. If thge law is against you, argue the facts. And if the facts and the law are against you, pound the table and blame the judge.\n\nAnd unfortunately, that's precisely the spot Blanche finds himself in. Both the law and the evidence are against him. Worse yet, both Blanche and his co-counsel Alina Habba were willing participants in their own self destruction, Banche far more so than Habba, who was pretty much a designated hitter to take on Stormy Daniels.\n\nThere are two basic cardinal rules to criminal defense as I understand it. The first is in opening statements, never promise more than you can deliver. Juries don't like being lied to or misled. And Blanche did it twice in his opening statement. First, he promised the jury that by the time he rose to speak to them again in closing arguments, he would prove that the Daniels affair never happened. And then he promised the jury that he would prove that the payments to Michael Cohen were standard legal fees, and not a reimbursement for the Daniels payoff. And they're not going to be able to argue either one of those in closing arguments.\n\nBut the second violation is even worse. To my understanding, the secret to a successful criminal defense is not to butt heads with the prosecution over the evidence. If the evidence and testimony wasn't compelling and admissible, the prosecution wouldn't be offering it. Instead the object is to ask probing questions in weak spots in the witnesses testimony.\n\nDone properly, this allows the defense to stand in front of the jury and argue alternative interpretations. They can say, Yes, the prosecution showed you these facts, and this testimony, and tells you it fits this way. But if you take into account the weakn esses in their theory that we exposed under cross examination, you could just as easily turn the puzzle this way and conclude that the defendant had nothing to do with it. They don't have to prove the theory, they just have to plant the seed of reasonable doubt.\n\nThey did neither. In their cross examinations of Daniels and Cohen, their basic strategy amounted to Liar! Liar! Pants on fire! And got crucified for it. Habba imploded by aggressively challenging Stormy Daniels's memory of their alleged affair, and had Daniels rattling off the style, size, and color of the floor tiles in Trump's room. And Blanche thought he had trapped Cohen on a conversation allegedly with Trump that could have been with Keith Schiller, only to have a photograph surface showing Trump with Schiller at the time of the call.\n\nAs I see it, here's Todd Blanche's final argument in a nutshell. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Stormy Daniels is nothing more or less than an extortionist, trying to pry money out of an innocent man. Keith Davidson is a bottom feeding lawyer who helps extortionists get money from innocent men. And Michael Cohen is a convicted serial liar who is bitter at his former employer for not bailing him out of his legal problems, in which President Trump had no part.\n\nThe documents the prosecution showed you are standard business documents, which they are skewing for their own purposes. There is no way you can convict a former President and current frontrunner to become President again in 2025 on the baseless and disproven accusations of extortionists and convicted serial liars! Thank you. Blanche won't touch Robert Costello with fire tongs.\n\nThe prosecution should be more entertaining. If I'm right, they'll hoist Blanche on his own petard by literally reading from his opening statement about disproving the affair, and the payments being reimbursements, and then lay out the evidence that proves Blanche was full of sh*t, while Blanche sits there red faced. Remind the jury that he misled them at the first opportunity.\n\nAnd then it will be story time. start with Pecker, then on to Davidson, Connahey and Daniels, highlighting their relevant testimony, and the supporting documentation. Then they'll segue into Cohen, admitting his shortcomings as a world class scumbag, but providing his testimony, and how every single document backs up his testimony. And they will make it as short as possible, in deference to the jury's time.\n\nAnd then it's all over but the shouting. The judge has already warned the jury that they may go overtime on Tuesday, so that he can read them the jury instructions from the bench. And then he'll send them home, with instructions to be back at 9 am Wednesday morning to begin deliberations. And then it's finally over. it's in the jury's hands. My personal guess? The jury comes back either late Thursday ot early Friday with convictions on at least 20 counts. Like King Solomon, they mah choose to split the baby, but it only takes one conviction to cost Trump his right to vote in November.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\nGetty Images\n\nLawyers for the Manhattan district attorney's office, which is prosecuting Donald Trump in his first criminal trial, have long encouraged Michael Cohen to stay away from the press. They didn't have much success. The media attention was like catnip to him, Mark Pomerantz, who once worked in the DA's office, wrote in his intimate account of his time. We had no way of keeping him away from the cameras.\n\nIt wasn't just that Cohen, who had followed Trump for years, loved being in the spotlight. Nor is it simply that Cohen, whose life was upended by Trump, wanted to humiliate his former boss. There was also money at stake. By bashing Trump, Cohen made about $4.4 million over the past four years, averaging $1.1 million a year, or about double that that his former boss paid him.\n\nFirst, he profited from books. Cohens Disloyal: A Memoir: The True Story of the Former Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump, was released in September 2020, two months before Americans went to the polls. It immediately became a #1 New York Times bestseller, remaining on the list for four weeks. The book has sold 290,400 copies in print, according to Circana BookScan, an industry data service. It earned Cohen about $2 million in just the first few months after its release and has since earned about $1 million more, he said.\n\nTwo years after publishing his first book, Cohen published Revenge: How Donald Trump Weaponized The Department of Justice Against His Critics, which spent a week on the bestseller list and sold 24,400 copies in print, more modestly, according to Circana BookScan. Cohen disputed the sales figures when contacted by Forbes but declined to answer further questions, citing the pending lawsuit. In court, he said the book earned him about $400,000.\n\nThe most impressive thing in the books? How Cohen structured the agreements surrounding them. Cohen testified at Trump's civil fraud trial last fall that he did not receive an advance for either book, and in 2020 the CEO of Skyhorse Publishing, which published Disloyal, told Publishers Weekly that Cohen had a non-traditional contract. As a result, he appears to have earned far more than he would have gotten with a standard book deal.\n\nAround the same time his first book was published, Cohen launched Mea Culpa, a profanity-filled podcast in which Cohen interviews various people familiar with Trump, including journalists turning his press contacts into profitable content. (Disclosure: This reporter has been a guest.) New episodes are released twice a week, although the show was on hiatus during the trial. Cohen testified that Mea Culpa averages about 300,000 downloads per week and has been downloaded more than 10 million times in total. It currently ranks among the 80 most popular political podcasts in the United States on Apple Podcasts, according to Chartable, an analytics service owned by Spotify.\n\nA second show, Political Beatdown, which Cohen co-hosts with attorney Ben Meiselas, debuted in February 2023. It live-streams two episodes per week on YouTube, the audio of which is then streamed to podcast apps . In total, the two podcasts generated about $1 million for Cohen through advertisements and merchandise, he testified. A T-shirt even got a bit of publicity during the trial, when Trump's defense team noted that Cohen was selling a T-shirt depicting Trump in an orange jumpsuit behind bars.\n\nEven when Cohen isn't making a lot of money, he seems happy to get attention. At the urging of his 20-something children, Cohen joined TikTok around December 2020. Like a true Gen Xer, he was slow to post at first. But Cohen eventually got into it, releasing hour-long videos every night around 10 p.m. for anyone willing to shell out $5.99 a month. For what? Building an audience to create a community, to really let off steam because I have trouble sleeping so I found an outlet, he explained at the trial. He also makes some money from it. According to TikTok, Cohens community has 309 followers, which suggests he's on track to earn around $22,000 per year, before TikTok takes any cut.\n\nThere's also Cameo, where Cohen records home videos for $100 and sends messages for $10 since November 2020. If that doesn't seem like a lot to you, consider how much he makes from CNN. The network puts him in front of hundreds of thousands of people, but it pays him absolutely nothing for his appearances, a CNN spokesperson said.\n\nHowever, all of this builds Cohens profile. He's already considering other ways to make money, perhaps writing a third book or starring in a TV show about his life, currently being shown under the title Fixer. He's even considering running for Congress, which would keep him in the spotlight for years to come.\n\nMore from Forbes Forbes Here's what happens if Trump is found guilty -- as the trial goes to

Across four days, the longtime publisher of the National Enquirer, who received immunity to testify, captivated jurors with details of the tabloid world's underbelly and the August 2015 Trump Tower meeting where the hush money scheme was allegedly birthed.\n\nPecker told the court he agreed at the meeting attended by him, Trump and Cohen to be the campaign's \"eyes and ears\" -- by looking out for stories brewing that could hurt Trump's candidacy to be bought and buried, run puff pieces about him to court voters with the assistance of then-National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard, and publish hit jobs about his opponents, like that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's father had connections to Lee Harvey Oswald.\n\nAMI paid Playboy model Karen McDougal $150,000 to stay silent about her allegations of a monthslong affair with Trump not long after his marriage to Melania as part of the scheme, Pecker said. It also silenced a doorman at Trump Tower with $30,000 for his claims about Trump fathering a child out of wedlock.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A360media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A360media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_and_kill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catch and kill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pecker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Pecker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Witch-hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Howard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Howard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_meeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trump Tower meeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karen McDougal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trump Tower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Enquirer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Enquirer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legal immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_(newspaper_format)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tabloid (newspaper format)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/290/29086/2908677.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-08-", "textStart": 1347, "textEnd": 1358}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

When the verdict comes in for the New York Donald Trump lawfare case, where, as I said before, there is no actual crime, and even if there were a crime, it would still be all about sex, Joe Biden \"plans to break his vow of silence and publicly address\" the verdict \"in a White House setting -- not a campaign one -- to show his statement isn't political.\" Further:\n\nIf the jury convicts Trump, Biden's team will then argue that the result shows Trump is ill-suited for office and that it demonstrates the extremes to which the former president would go to win again. The campaign's social media team is considering leveraging the line of attack further, with discussions underway about referring to the ex-president online as \"Convicted Felon Donald Trump.\"\n\nSometimes, it is hard to fathom the stupidity of the Biden campaign. As I said a month ago, the New York case is a \"historic mistake\" by the Democrats and Biden - a Biden former Department of Justice plant is clearly directing it - and as we have seen from the polling, the ridiculously biased case has actually \"backfired spectacularly on the Democrats\" and is helping Donald Trump to a consistent lead in the Presidential polling.\n\nThere are, of course, three possible outcomes - \"guilty,\" \"not guilty,\" or a hung jury. If Trump is found \"guilty\" by the heavily biased Democrat jury, Biden and his crack crew of political consultants really believe that Biden speaking about it at the White House and calling Trump a \"convict\" is going to be perceived as non-political and will ignite a voter rebellion against Donald Trump in the 2024 election.\n\nWhere is Biff Tannen when you need him? \"Hello, hello, anybody home? Hey, think Joe, think!\"\n\nI realize that some polls have shown that some voters may be concerned if Donald Trump becomes a felon. But 1) some of these people are Never Trumpers, and 2) I, and elections expert Tom Bevan, simply don't believe that when push comes to shove, objective swing voters or Trump supporters will react that way.\n\nInstead, I believe the average, objective swing voter is almost certainly going to think the following things about a \"guilty\" verdict in the New York trial.\n\nAnd Trump supporters will believe all of this even more strongly.\n\nAre any of these thoughts really going to help Joe Biden at the ballot box in 2024?\n\n\"Hello, hello, anybody home? Hey, think Joe, think!\"\n\nThe problem Joe Biden, his campaign, and the left in general are facing is that they have a bad case of confirmation bias. This is a person's \"tendency to process information by looking for, or interpreting, information that is consistent with their existing beliefs. This biased approach to decision making is largely unintentional, and it results in a person ignoring information that is inconsistent with their beliefs.\" The left really believes that Donald Trump is the Devil, and everything that happens to him demonstrates to them the truth of their belief, which they want to share with everyone else.\n\nThey are also desperate. Unlike in 2020, Joe Biden has been consistently behind Donald Trump in the polling, both national and state-to-state, for about a year now. And he needs to be ahead by three points to win in the electoral college.\n\nAnd boy, are the Democrats going to be sorry if Joe Biden acts based on his and other leftists' confirmation bias and their desperation. Because every time he brings up the case, he is going to remind the Trump supporters -- and the average objective swing voters -- of what this case means to them, which is not good for the Biden campaign.\n\nAnd what happens if the jury somehow manages to return a \"not guilty\" verdict, or there is a hung jury? Well, then the average, objective swing voter will be thinking:\n\nOnce again, the Trump supporters will believe this even more strongly.\n\nWhat's funny is the Democrats are probably going to be better off if the verdict is \"not guilty\" or there is a hung jury. Why? Because the average, objective, swing voters will only be reminded of Democrat stupidity once, when the verdict is announced. If it is \"guilty,\" then they will be reminded about this stupidity whenever Trump's status as a felon comes up, or Trump talks about it, or the Democrats crow about it.\n\nThe Democrats are clearly in a hole right now, and they really should stop digging. But they are deluded and desperate, so they can't, and they won't.

More than three years after reluctantly leaving office, after numerous investigations into his behavior and after more than a month in a New York courtroom, former President Donald Trump will soon reach the end of a criminal trial. All that remains are the prosecution and defense summaries, and then 12 New Yorkers will be instructed and sent to make one of the most monumental decisions in our nation's history.\n\nWe have no way of knowing how long the jurors will deliberate. Journalists and legal analysts have scanned jurors' expressions and gestures, but even so, it is impossible to know the first thoughts and feelings each person will express in the jury room and how those thoughts and feelings might change if they were contested. My sense, however, is that whatever happens, America is in no way ready for the new chapter that a verdict or lack thereof in the Trump case will open.\n\nOnce the president announces the jury's decision, all previous assumptions regarding the 2024 presidential race will have to be recalculated.\n\nThere are at least three likely options awaiting us on the other side of the deliberations. Trump could be convicted of falsifying business records to conceal cash payments made to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Jury could find prosecution failed to make its case and pay it in full. Or the jury could signal that it is deadlocked, leading Judge Juan Merchan to declare a mistrial.\n\nAssuming there is a verdict, once the president announces the jury's decision, all previous assumptions regarding the 2024 presidential race will have to be recalculated. Polls conducted since Trump was first indicted have only been able to ask respondents to consider what-ifs. A March survey by Politico Magazine and Ipsos found that a conviction could cost Trump just over a third of independents in the fall. Similarly, a February NBC News poll showed that a conviction in the New York trial removed much of Trump's support from independents and prompted a major shift from 18 to 34-year-olds in favor of President Joe Biden against Trump . And an ABC News/Ipsos survey conducted in late April found that 20% of Trump supporters surveyed would reconsider their support (16%) or withdraw it (4%) if he were convicted.\n\nWe're finally moving from possibility to hard and fast reality, which can look very different from poll-based predictions. And as encouraging as these statistics may have been for Democrats, they still leave some important questions unanswered. None of the polls above asked voters how an acquittal would impact their support for the former president, which remains a possibility. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the number of people changing their vote would be sufficient to change the outcome of the election in a given state. Here's how NBC News cautioned its findings, which showed an overall swing in Biden's favor in the face of conviction but still within the margin of error:\n\nRepublican pollster Bill McInturff, the Republican half of the bipartisan group of pollsters conducting the NBC News survey, warns that the small group of voters moving on those two ballots, 55 in total out of 1,000 interviews, have overwhelmingly negative views of Biden, and they also preferred a Republican-controlled Congress by more than 60 points.\n\nAs a result, McInturff says, he doubts that these voters would truly remain loyal to Biden even if Trump were convicted of a crime.\n\nBiden chose to stay silent on Trump's legal troubles as the cases unfolded, but his campaign is now preparing to use a guilty verdict to his advantage, NBC News recently reported, debating internally whether he had to be called a convicted criminal in his message. Whatever the outcome, a person familiar with the discussions told NBC News that the campaign will emphasize to voters that Donald Trump's legal problems will not prevent him from reaching the White House. Only one thing will succeed: voting in November for Joe Biden. If there is an acquittal, however, it is difficult to say whether another case where Trump appears immune from accountability would encourage or discourage Democrats from running.\n\nWe're finally moving from possibility to hard and fast reality, which can look very different from poll-based predictions.\n\nDepending on the outcome of the jury, Trump, as he always has, will either praise or denounce the system. A state court conviction would be something he couldn't overturn, even if he were president again. It would be yet another asterisk next to his name, one more humiliation to add to the list. While it would be another grievance he could seek revenge against, an appeal would be yet another costly distraction for a campaign already bleeding money on its legal fees. And yet his supporters, like the soulless Republicans who showed up in court to support him, might just shrug their shoulders and vote for a convicted felon.\n\nAn acquittal, however, would be another so-called total exoneration and this time it would be true. (Of course, a process that he otherwise claims is rigged and which always rules in his favor has proven its merit in his mind.) It wouldn't be surprising if his campaign considered even a hung jury a victory. I can already imagine one of his many emails explaining how crooked Joe Biden (who had nothing to do with the accusation) had failed to get him to appear in court. This will prompt his supporters to donate when the biased Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, as I imagine the copy will call him, indicts him again.\n\nAll this is of course only projection, while waiting for the end of the gaping silence which has resonated since the defense, which called only one witness, rested on Tuesday. In this liminal space, the future hangs by a thread. Guilty? Not guilty? A mistrial? Either way, it will probably be more than we can really imagine.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ipsos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Margin of error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-05/240523-bw-donald-trump-trial-ac-1159p-c45093.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

They are portraying the trial as a \"witch-hunt ginned up by Joe Biden, and obviously because of that\", they say \"he will be found not guilty, but at the same time, they are arguing that if he is found guilty, it will be because the jury and the judge are partisan and corrupt\".\n\nThe trial in New York concerns one of four criminal indictments Trump faces, but will probably be the only one that concludes before the November election.\n\nAs of this month, Trump leads Biden in several recent polls.\n\nA camera ban in the Manhattan courtroom is hardly unique to the Trump hush-money case. In the US, only the District of Columbia is more restrictive than New York in terms of allowing audio-visual coverage of court proceedings, among 48 jurisdictions reviewed in a report by the Fund for Modern Courts. And a shortage of in-house visuals means the public has to rely on courtroom sketches and secondhand accounts of what occurred during trial proceedings.\n\n\"You know the saying, 'The camera never blinks,' I think if you just had a fixed camera in the courtroom, it wouldn't interpret; it would just be what is in front of the camera,\" said Howard Polskin, president of The Righting, a newsletter and website that monitors conservative media.\n\nBoth Polksin and Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a University of Pennsylvania communications professor and director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center, which publishes Factcheck.org, contrasted coverage of the Trump trial with that of the OJ Simpson murder trial in 1995. The judge allowed live camera coverage of the courtroom, and the case captivated the nation.\n\n\"When we are actually observing something, we are making judgments in the moment that are potentially very powerful in shaping perceptions,\" said Jamieson. \"When someone recounts something to us, the effect is less vivid, less immediate.\"\n\nSince a retelling makes for less dramatic content than photos and videos of, for example, recent protests on college campuses concerning the war in Gaza, analysts said that cable news networks - particularly Fox News - have devoted less time to it.\n\nFrom 15 April to 17 May, Fox News mentioned the trial about half as much as CNN and MSNBC, according to calculations provided by Roger Macdonald of the Internet Archive TV News in a Politico report.\n\nDuring the first week of the trial, 55% of Americans said that they were not closely following or not watching it at all, according to a poll from the PBS NewsHour, NPR and Marist.\n\n\"It's Christmas in May for Trump,\" Polskin said. \"It was a gift for Trump that there were no cameras in the courtroom. I think there would have been a lot more coverage on both left, right and mainstream if that were the case.\"\n\nThat void then provided more space for Trump to shape the narrative, Jamieson said.\n\nTrump has repeatedly ignored a gag order imposed by Judge Juan Merchan in March after the former president attacked people including the judge, the judge's daughter, Cohen, the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, and members of the jury.\n\nOn his social media platform Truth Social, Trump has shared posts in which he quoted the Fox News host Jesse Watters describing potential jurors as \"undercover liberal activists\" and a New York Post story that labeled Cohen a \"serial perjurer\".\n\nWhile Trump refrained from violating the order in recent weeks of the trial, high-profile supporters have instead leveled similar charges outside the courtroom. Sean Hannity and other cable news hosts followed suit.\n\n\"Tonight, as your mentally vacant president shuffles through the halls of the White House in his maximum-stability sneakers, lawyers and bureaucrats in the Democratic Party - they are hard at work,\" Hannity said at the start of his Fox News show on 21 May. \"You see, they are determined to get Donald Trump by any means necessary and are using America's system of justice as a political weapon.\"\n\nHannity also hosted legal analysts such as Gregg Jarrett and Alan Dershowitz, who have described it as a \"corrupt case\" and called Stormy Daniels a \"shakedown artist\".\n\nTrump later repeated such assertions when he spoke outside the courtroom.\n\n\"There is a kind of feedback loop that happens between Fox News and Trump's public-facing legal commentary in which he is quoting figures like [Jarrett and Dershowitz] and then saying, 'This is what all the experts are saying,' just the experts [are] from Fox News,\" Gertz said.\n\nFox News, Newsmax and One America News Network have also frequently described the criminal charges against Trump as \"lawfare\" committed by Democrats. (And it's not just the cable news personalities - Hannity quoted the film-maker Oliver Stone, who described the lawfare as a \"new form of warfare\".)\n\nRelated: 'Mr Trump, why won't you testify?': hush-money trial nears end with a fizzle, not a bang\n\nThe goal, Polskin said, was to convey that the trial is \"completely politically motivated\".\n\nStill, is it possible that rather than Fox News devoting too little time to the trial, CNN and MSNBC are devoting too much time to it?\n\nThe Daily Show host Jon Stewart critiqued the media for its coverage of events at the start of trial, such as the former president driving from Trump Tower to the courtroom. During the 2016 presidential election, networks drew big ratings by airing his rallies live and uninterrupted and later faced criticism for giving the candidate free airtime.\n\n\"Perhaps if we limit the coverage to the issues at hand and try not to create an all-encompassing spectacle of the most banal of details. Perhaps that would help,\" Stewart said of the early trial coverage.\n\nOn whether CNN and MSNBC were again spending too much time on Trump, Jamieson said: \"The question always is, what else is in the news agenda? And as a result, what aren't you covering? We are in a relatively quiet period legislatively in the United States, so it's hard to make the argument that there is some big major story that's being downplayed.\"\n\nGertz, of Media Matters for America, points out that Trump has spent the last nine years engaged in a cycle of saying and doing shocking things, followed by rightwing media hosts and pundits condemning backlash against Trump as unfair, so their handling of the trial is not particularly novel.\n\n\"They know that every alleged infraction or crime committed by Trump is an opportunity for them to prove that they are onboard with the Maga movement and with Trump specifically,\" he explained, \"by loudly saying that he did nothing wrong and that his pursuers are in fact the real criminals.\"", "source": {"uri":

It's just a joke, guys, that Biden is trying to taunt his opponent over lawfare that is being pursued by a Democratic DA.\n\nIt's probably just a joke when Democrats like Rep.

It's a political attack and where he says it from wouldn't change that.

It also makes me think he thinks there's going to be a conviction.\n\nBut if you object or call it out, then you're not accepting that the \"system\" works here. If you're concerned about trials against political opponents and how that's antithetical to the very nature of America, then it's you who has a problem. Oh, and they're considering insulting Trump if he's convicted, just to top it all off.\n\nDo they have any sense at all? Do they really think it's a good idea to try to take a lap on Trump, when people already think it's political? They would just reemphasize that.

The purpose of the sit-down, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Pecker would later tell a Manhattan court, was to hash out a plan for the following year's election.\n\nMr. Trump had launched his presidential campaign two months earlier and wanted help from Mr. Pecker, a supermarket tabloid publisher best known for running the National Enquirer. Mr. Pecker would later testify that he agreed to find and suppress negative stories about Mr. Trump ahead of the vote. Mr. Cohen, Mr. Trump's lawyer and fixer, would co-ordinate the operation.\n\nThis scheme would ultimately lead to a US$130,000 hush-money payout to porn star Stormy Daniels, and years later, the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president.\n\nThis week, after hearing five weeks of testimony and Tuesday's closing arguments, the jury in the historic case is expected to begin weighing Mr. Trump's fate. The proceedings are the least serious of the four criminal indictments the former president faces, which also include prosecutions for trying to overturn the 2020 election and absconding with classified documents.\n\nBut the hush-money case is likely to be the only one to go to trial before Mr. Trump attempts to reclaim the White House in November. And prosecutors have framed it as being about far more than a personal peccadillo. Rather, they argue, it was a bid to illegally corrupt the 2016 election, implicitly tying it to a larger pattern of conduct by Mr. Trump, who would go on to attempt the complete reversal of the 2020 presidential vote.\n\nThe indictment charges 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up the payment to Ms. Daniels. Normally, these would be misdemeanours, less serious crimes under New York state law. Prosecutors, however, are asking the jury to find that they were committed to hide evidence of a violation of federal campaign-finance rules, a different crime for which Mr. Trump was not on trial. This would upgrade the charges to felonies. The prosecution maintains that the payoff was effectively an undeclared and illegal contribution to Mr. Trump's election effort.\n\nThe ultimate effect of the case is riddled with unknowns, not least whether a conviction would tip the knife-edge election toward Mr. Trump's rival, President Joe Biden. Either way, the evidence has offered a detailed look at how Mr. Trump has operated.\n\nFrom the witness stand in a Lower Manhattan courtroom, those once close to Mr. Trump have described a clandestine world of adultery, lies, payoffs and intimidation - frequently accompanied by farcical scenes of screaming and threats. Here is a recap of what the jury heard.\n\nShortly before Mr. Trump launched his candidacy in the lobby of Trump Tower in June, 2015, according to testimony from Mr. Cohen, the reality television star warned him: \"Just be prepared: there are going to be a lot of women coming forward.\"\n\nTwo months later, the fixer summoned Mr. Pecker for the meeting. The full plan, Mr. Pecker testified, was for the Enquirer to publish positive stories about Mr. Trump and negative stories about his political rivals, and for Mr. Pecker to let Mr. Trump know if he caught wind of anyone shopping around scandalous information about the candidate.\n\n\"I will be your eyes and ears,\" Mr. Pecker recounted telling Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen. Mr. Pecker was happy to help out, he explained, because Mr. Trump regularly leaked him stories, including scoops on whom he would next fire on his reality show, The Apprentice.\n\nIn the following months, Mr. Pecker put the plan into effect. He ran yards of copy hyping Mr. Trump's campaign and bashing his opponents. Mr. Cohen provided story ideas and vetted pieces before they ran, Mr. Pecker said. One particularly audacious story involved fabricating a photo showing the father of Senator Ted Cruz, Mr. Trump's chief rival for the Republican nomination, with Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before the assassination of president John F. Kennedy.\n\nThen, according to Mr. Pecker, on two occasions he performed what are known as \"catch and kill\" operations for Mr. Trump. In the first case, Mr. Pecker's company, American Media Inc., or AMI, paid US$30,000 for the rights to the story of Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman who claimed Mr. Trump had impregnated a housekeeper. In the second, AMI paid US$150,000 to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy playmate who said she and the married Mr. Trump had an affair in 2006 and 2007.\n\nAMI's investigations, led by the Enquirer's editor-in-chief at the time, Dylan Howard, concluded that Mr. Sajudin's story was false and that Ms. McDougal's was probably true. The outcome, however, was the same. AMI bought both stories with the intention of not running them. Mr. Sajudin and Ms. McDougal signed contracts that imposed US$1-million penalties if they took their allegations anywhere else.\n\nAt first, Mr. Pecker said, the plan was for Mr. Trump to pay AMI back. To that end, Mr. Pecker and Mr. Cohen intended to use a middleman and a shell company to hide the transaction. But as Mr. Trump dragged his feet, Mr. Pecker received legal advice on the campaign finance implications of such payments, he said, and decided to call off the reimbursement plan.\n\nNext came Ms. Daniels, a porn industry actor, writer and director. She claimed to have had sex with Mr. Trump in his Lake Tahoe hotel room during a celebrity golf tournament in the summer of 2006. In court, she recounted making fun of the pyjamas he was wearing when she arrived (\"Does Hugh Hefner know you stole his outfit?\") and spanking him with a rolled-up copy of a magazine with his face on the cover, as punishment for repeatedly interrupting her.\n\nWhen she tried to leave, she said, Mr. Trump put pressure on her to stay by dangling career opportunities and mocking her difficult upbringing. He could help her \"get out of that trailer park,\" she recalled him saying. During sex, \"I was staring at the ceiling,\" she said. \"I was trying to think about anything other than what was happening there.\" Mr. Trump denies that he had sex with Ms. Daniels.\n\nIn October, 2016, just a month before the election, Ms. Daniels's then-lawyer and agent, Keith Davidson, contacted Mr. Howard about selling her story. When Mr. Trump learned of this, Mr. Cohen said, he flew into a rage.\n\n\"Women will hate me. Guys, they think it's cool. But this is going to be a disaster for the campaign,\" Mr. Cohen quoted Mr. Trump as saying. Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump gave clear orders: \"Push it out as long as you can. Just get past the election.\"\n\nMr. Trump was concerned only about the election and did not seem to care what effect the adultery accusations would have on his marriage, Mr. Cohen said. \"How long do you think I will be on the market for?\" he recalled Mr. Trump saying. \"Not long.\"\n\nAt first, Mr. Cohen made excuses not to send Ms. Daniels the money. When Mr. Davidson threatened to have Ms. Daniels give her story to the Daily Mail, Mr. Cohen said, Mr. Trump relented. \"Just do it,\" Mr. Cohen recounted Mr. Trump telling him.\n\nThis time, Mr. Pecker refused to pay. So Mr. Cohen drew US$130,000 from his home equity line of credit, set up a shell company called Essential Consultants and wired the money. Ms. Daniels signed a non-disclosure agreement under the pseudonym \"Peggy Peterson.\" (Mr. Trump was \"David Dennison.\")\n\nIn January, 2017, Mr. Cohen said, he and Mr. Trump agreed on a repayment plan, scrawled out in the hand of Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization's chief financial officer. In total, Mr. Cohen would receive US$420,000: reimbursement for the payment to Ms. Daniels, reimbursement for another US$50,000 expense and a US$60,000 bonus, with the total doubled to cover taxes.\n\nMr. Cohen said he and Mr. Trump further finalized this arrangement at an Oval Office meeting shortly after Mr. Trump took office as president in 2017. The payments, disguised as a legal retainer, came in the form of monthly cheques from Mr. Trump, Mr. Cohen said.\n\nMr. Cohen's invoices, the cheques and the Trump Organization's books were all falsified, the prosecution alleges, to make these payments seem like legitimate fees for service. In reality, Mr. Cohen said, he performed almost no legal work for Mr. Trump while receiving the payments, save for helping first lady Melania Trump with a deal to have her wax likeness installed at Madame Tussauds.\n\nThroughout their testimony, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Pecker put Mr. Trump at the centre of the hush-money schemes. They recounted instance after instance of Mr. Trump's personal involvement in orchestrating payouts.\n\nIn a recording Mr. Cohen made at the time on his phone, which was played in court, Mr. Trump asked of Ms. McDougal's story, \"What do we got to pay for this, 150?\" before suggesting they \"pay with cash.\"\n\nWhen The Wall Street Journal revealed the payment to Ms. McDougal four days before the election, Mr. Pecker recalled, a \"very upset\" and \"agitated\" Mr. Trump calling to berate him. In post-election meetings at Trump Tower and the White House, Mr. Pecker said, Mr. Trump asked him about Ms. McDougal and thanked him for his handling of the situation. In one phone call to discuss extending Ms. McDougal's hush-money contract, Mr. Pecker said, Mr. Trump had two of his White House aides, Hope Hicks and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, join in.\n\nEverything began to unravel in early 2018. Other reporters followed the Wall Street Journal's reporting. Ms. McDougal and Ms. Daniels broke their silence.\n\nMr. Pecker received a letter from the Federal Election Commission. Mr. Cohen tried to reassure him that Jeff Sessions, then the attorney-general, would make the case go away.\n\n\"Why are you worried?\" Mr. Pecker recalled Mr. Cohen asking him. \"Trump has him in his pocket.\" This manifestly did not happen. Ultimately, AMI paid a US$180,000 fine for effectively making illegal campaign contributions with its payoffs.\n\nIn Mr. Cohen's case, the FBI showed up at his hotel with a search warrant in April of that year. Later that day, Mr. Cohen said, Mr. Trump called him one final time, saying, \"Don't worry. I'm president of the United States. There's nothing here. Everything's going to be okay. Stay tough.\"\n\nThat summer, Mr. Cohen chose to plead guilty to his role in the payout to Ms. Daniels - along with several other unrelated crimes - and turned on his former boss.\n\nMr. Trump's defence is taking several tacks. One is to contend that the case is a mere \"bookkeeping\" dispute.\n\n\"The 34 counts, ladies and gentlemen, are really just pieces of paper,\" said Todd Blanche, Mr. Trump's lead defence lawyer, in his opening statement to the court.\n\nAnother is to argue that the payments to Mr. Cohen really did represent legitimate fees for legal services, and that the business records were therefore not false.\n\nA third is to distance Mr. Trump from the payoffs made on his behalf.\n\nThe centrepiece of the defence's strategy, however, was a bid to discredit Mr. Cohen. Mr. Blanche accused Mr. Cohen of lying on the witness stand in a bid for revenge against Mr. Trump.\n\nIn an effort to pre-empt this, prosecutors called Mr. Cohen as their last witness, so that many details of his account had already been related by others and backed up by documents.\n\nProsecutors also had Mr. Cohen run through an exhaustive list of his misdeeds. He went to federal prison for his part in the payment to Ms. Daniels, and also pleaded guilty to unrelated counts of tax evasion and lying to Congress. On the stand, he admitted to making US$4-million selling his influence over the White House to large corporations during the first year of the Trump administration. Mr. Cohen portrayed himself as a former Trump sycophant who felt \"on top of the world\" while in Mr. Trump's employ.\n\nMr. Blanche prodded Mr. Cohen for more confessions. Mr. Cohen conceded that he didn't think he should have been charged with tax evasion, and therefore had lied to a federal judge when he expressed contrition for the crime.\n\nHe also admitted under Mr. Blanche's questioning to stealing US$60,000 by inflating the amount of reimbursement he was owed for paying a company to rig an online poll about famous businesspeople, in a bid to improve Mr. Trump's standing.\n\n\"You stole from the Trump Organization,\" Mr. Blanche said. \"Yes, sir,\" Mr. Cohen replied.\n\nSince turning on Mr. Trump, Mr. Cohen said, he had made US$4-million from a podcast and two books about the case.\n\nAlthough Mr. Cohen's demeanour in court was restrained and cautious, the defence gave the jury glimpses of his bombastic persona by playing podcast clips in which he shouted about his excitement over seeing Mr. Trump arrested. On social media and in podcasts, Mr. Cohen has referred to Mr. Trump as a \"Cheeto-dusted cartoon villain\" and \"dictator douchebag.\"\n\nMr. Cohen, however, flatly denied accusations he is now lying to incriminate Mr. Trump. In one dramatic moment, Mr. Blanche accused Mr. Cohen of fabricating a telephone conversation with Mr. Trump about the payment to Ms. Daniels.\n\n\"That. Was. A. Lie!\" Mr. Blanche shouted. \"You can admit it.\" Mr. Cohen replied: \"No, sir, I can't.\"\n\nIn the end, Mr. Trump did not make good on his promises to take the stand in his own defence. The only substantive witness his lawyers did call, a lawyer named Bob Costello, turned out to be a headache.\n\nProsecutor Susan Hoffinger used a string of Mr. Costello's own e-mails to show that he had been part of a covert effort by the White House to keep Mr. Cohen from turning on Mr. Trump.\n\nAnd he was almost tossed from the witness stand after he talked over objections, muttered \"jeez\" in response to a ruling by Justice Juan Merchan and rolled his eyes. The judge cleared the courtroom, admonished Mr. Costello and threatened to strike his testimony from the record if he didn't change his behaviour.\n\nThroughout the trial, Mr. Trump's personal theatrics drew almost as much attention as the scenes described on the witness stand. The former president repeatedly violated a gag order prohibiting him from intimidating witnesses, jurors and court staff. Justice Merchan fined Mr. Trump US$10,000 and threatened to send him to jail if he kept at it.\n\nSo Mr. Trump came up with a workaround. Every day in the latter part of the trial, he brought a large rotating entourage with him, including several people he is auditioning to be his vice-presidential running-mate. They would go out and launch the sort of verbal attacks Mr. Trump was prohibited from making.\n\nMr. Trump also repeatedly griped about the cold temperatures in the 1930s-era courtroom after Justice Merchan refused a request by Mr. Blanche to turn up the heat.\n\nThe trial even had some trouble nailing down a jury after several prospective jurors, and one who had already been chosen for the panel, became fearful of being harassed if their identities were disclosed.\n\nMr. Trump's defence combed through potential jurors' social media profiles to cull those with histories of disparaging the former president. Prosecutors tried to eliminate anyone likely to have conservative politics. A conviction must be unanimous, meaning that even a single juror could hang the decision.\n\nMr. Trump frequently appeared to doze off, sitting back in his chair with his eyes closed. District Attorney Alvin Bragg, the official who decided to bring the case, attended parts of the trial in person, including Mr. Cohen's testimony.\n\nEach charge against Mr. Trump carries a maximum four-year penalty. But even if convicted and sentenced to prison, it is unlikely that he would start serving his sentence before the election. Likely, he would remain free pending an appeal.\n\nStill, a conviction would put voters in the position of having to choose whether they want a felon in the country's highest office.", "source":

They haven't had much success. \"The media attention was like catnip to him,\" Mark Pomerantz, who once worked in the DA's office, wrote in his inside account of his time. \"We had no means of keeping him away from the cameras.\"\n\nIt wasn't only that Cohen, who had shadowed Trump for years, liked being in the limelight. Nor was it just that Cohen, whose life had been upended by Trump, wanted to humiliate his former boss. There was also money at stake-lots of it. In bashing Trump, Cohen has earned about $4.4 million over the last four years, averaging out to $1.1 million annually, or roughly double what his former boss paid him.\n\nFirst, he cashed in on books. Cohen's Disloyal: A Memoir: The True Story of the Former Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump, came out in September 2020, two months before Americans took to the polls. It became an immediate No. 1 New York Times best-seller, staying on the list for four weeks. The book sold 290,400 print copies, according to Circana BookScan, an industry data service. It made Cohen about $2 million in just the first few months after it was released and has gone on to bring in around another $1 million since, he testified.\n\nTwo years after publishing his first book, Cohen released Revenge: How Donald Trump Weaponized The Department of Justice Against His Critics, which spent one week on the best-seller list and sold a more modest 24,400 print copies, according to Circana BookScan. Cohen disputed the sales figures when contacted by Forbes but declined to answer other questions, citing the ongoing trial. In court, he testified that the book earned him \"around $400,000.\"\n\nThe most impressive thing about the books? How Cohen structured the deals surrounding them. Cohen testified in Trump's civil fraud trial last fall that he did not receive an advance for either book and, in 2020, the CEO of Skyhorse Publishing, which released Disloyal, told Publishers Weekly that Cohen had a \"nontraditional contract.\" As a result, he appears to have earned far more than he would have with a standard book deal.\n\nAround the same time his first book was published, Cohen launched \"Mea Culpa,\" a profanity-laced podcast in which Cohen interviews various people familiar with Trump, including journalists-turning his press contacts into profitable content. (Disclosure: This reporter has been a guest.) New episodes post twice a week, although the show has been on hiatus during the trial. Cohen testified that \"Mea Culpa\" averages around 300,000 downloads a week and has been downloaded a total of more than 10 million times. It currently ranks among the top 80 most-popular political podcasts in the United States on Apple Podcasts, according to Chartable, an analytics service owned by Spotify.\n\nA second show, \"Political Beatdown,\" which Cohen co-hosts with attorney Ben Meiselas, debuted in February 2023. It livestreams two episodes a week to YouTube, the audio of which is then pushed out to podcast apps. In all, the two podcasts have generated about $1 million for Cohen via ads and merchandise, he testified. One T-shirt even got a little bit of publicity during the trial, when Trump's defense team noted that Cohen is hawking a T-shirt depict Trump in an orange jumpsuit behind bars.\n\nEven when Cohen isn't making much money, though, he seems happy to get attention. At the urging of his 20-something kids, Cohen joined TikTok around December 2020. Like a true Gen Xer, he was slow to post at first. But Cohen eventually got into it, streaming hour-long videos nightly around 10 p.m. for anyone willing to shell out $5.99 a month. Why? \"Build an audience to create a community, to really vent because I am having a difficult time sleeping so I found an outlet,\" he explained at trial. He also makes a little money from it. According to TikTok, Cohen's \"community\" consists of 309 subscribers, which would suggest he is on pace to earn about $22,000 a year, before TikTok takes any cut.\n\nThere's also Cameo, where Cohen has been recording personal videos for $100 and sending messages for $10 since as early as November 2020. If that doesn't sound like much, consider what he earns from CNN. The network puts him in front of hundreds of thousands of people, but it pays him exactly nothing for his appearances, a CNN spokesperson said.\n\nAll of this, however, builds Cohen's profile.

Trump's lawyers are expected to highlight the absence of Allen Weisselberg, Mr. Trump's former finance chief, who is serving jail time for perjury.\n\nDays before his inauguration in Washington in 2017, Donald J. Trump had a debt to settle in New York: a payout to his fixer, Michael D. Cohen. They met on the 26th floor of Trump Tower, Mr. Cohen says, and struck a $420,000 deal.\n\nSeven years later, Mr. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan hinges on that fleeting encounter, which is both critically important and completely in dispute. Mr. Cohen says he paid off a porn star at his boss's behest, and in that meeting, he and Mr. Trump settled on a plan to repay him and conceal the reimbursement as legal expenses. Mr. Trump says his former fixer is a liar.\n\nBut prosecutors say there was a third man in the room that day: Allen H. Weisselberg, Mr. Trump's moneyman, the keeper of the balance sheet. And he is not saying anything at all.\n\nProsecutors never called Mr. Weisselberg to testify, because, although he knows the truth, he has not always told it. He is serving time in the Rikers Island jail complex after pleading guilty to perjury in an unrelated civil case involving Mr. Trump, the man he served for nearly half a century.\n\nThe defense did not call Mr. Weisselberg either, nor did Mr. Trump take the stand in his own defense. And for weeks, Mr. Weisselberg's absence has loomed large over Mr. Trump's case, the first criminal trial of an American president.\n\nIn closing arguments on Tuesday, his lawyers are expected to cast Mr. Weisselberg as the prosecution's missing piece, an elusive central player in the case. They are likely to underscore for the jury just how much of the case depends on the word of Mr. Cohen, whose testimony provided the only evidence that Mr. Trump had direct knowledge of the plot to disguise the hush-money reimbursement as legal fees.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inauguration of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Weisselberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allen Weisselberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trump Tower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_boss", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crime boss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rikers_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rikers Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rikers Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Buzkashi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Buzkashi", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/26/multimedia/00trump-weisselberg1-mzlt/00trump-weisselberg1-mzlt-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

They are portraying the trial as a \"witch-hunt ginned up by Joe Biden, and obviously because of that\", they say \"he will be found not guilty, but at the same time, they are arguing that if he is found guilty, it will be because the jury and the judge are partisan and corrupt\".\n\nThe trial in New York concerns one of four criminal indictments Trump faces, but will probably be the only one that concludes before the November election.\n\nAs of this month, Trump leads Biden in several recent polls.\n\nA camera ban in the Manhattan courtroom is hardly unique to the Trump hush-money case. In the US, only the District of Columbia is more restrictive than New York in terms of allowing audio-visual coverage of court proceedings, among 48 jurisdictions reviewed in a report by the Fund for Modern Courts. And a shortage of in-house visuals means the public has to rely on courtroom sketches and secondhand accounts of what occurred during trial proceedings.\n\n\"You know the saying, 'The camera never blinks,' I think if you just had a fixed camera in the courtroom, it wouldn't interpret; it would just be what is in front of the camera,\" said Howard Polskin, president of The Righting, a newsletter and website that monitors conservative media.\n\nBoth Polksin and Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a University of Pennsylvania communications professor and director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center, which publishes Factcheck.org, contrasted coverage of the Trump trial with that of the OJ Simpson murder trial in 1995. The judge allowed live camera coverage of the courtroom, and the case captivated the nation.\n\n\"When we are actually observing something, we are making judgments in the moment that are potentially very powerful in shaping perceptions,\" said Jamieson. \"When someone recounts something to us, the effect is less vivid, less immediate.\"\n\nSince a retelling makes for less dramatic content than photos and videos of, for example, recent protests on college campuses concerning the war in Gaza, analysts said that cable news networks - particularly Fox News - have devoted less time to it.\n\nFrom 15 April to 17 May, Fox News mentioned the trial about half as much as CNN and MSNBC, according to calculations provided by Roger Macdonald of the Internet Archive TV News in a Politico report.\n\nDuring the first week of the trial, 55% of Americans said that they were not closely following or not watching it at all, according to a poll from the PBS NewsHour, NPR and Marist.\n\n\"It's Christmas in May for Trump,\" Polskin said. \"It was a gift for Trump that there were no cameras in the courtroom. I think there would have been a lot more coverage on both left, right and mainstream if that were the case.\"\n\nThat void then provided more space for Trump to shape the narrative, Jamieson said.\n\nTrump has repeatedly ignored a gag order imposed by Judge Juan Merchan in March after the former president attacked people including the judge, the judge's daughter, Cohen, the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, and members of the jury.\n\nOn his social media platform Truth Social, Trump has shared posts in which he quoted the Fox News host Jesse Watters describing potential jurors as \"undercover liberal activists\" and a New York Post story that labeled Cohen a \"serial perjurer\".\n\nWhile Trump refrained from violating the order in recent weeks of the trial, high-profile supporters have instead leveled similar charges outside the courtroom. Sean Hannity and other cable news hosts followed suit.\n\n\"Tonight, as your mentally vacant president shuffles through the halls of the White House in his maximum-stability sneakers, lawyers and bureaucrats in the Democratic Party - they are hard at work,\" Hannity said at the start of his Fox News show on 21 May. \"You see, they are determined to get Donald Trump by any means necessary and are using America's system of justice as a political weapon.\"\n\nHannity also hosted legal analysts such as Gregg Jarrett and Alan Dershowitz, who have described it as a \"corrupt case\" and called Stormy Daniels a \"shakedown artist\".\n\nTrump later repeated such assertions when he spoke outside the courtroom.\n\n\"There is a kind of feedback loop that happens between Fox News and Trump's public-facing legal commentary in which he is quoting figures like [Jarrett and Dershowitz] and then saying, 'This is what all the experts are saying,' just the experts [are] from Fox News,\" Gertz said.\n\nFox News, Newsmax and One America News Network have also frequently described the criminal charges against Trump as \"lawfare\" committed by Democrats. (And it's not just the cable news personalities - Hannity quoted the film-maker Oliver Stone, who described the lawfare as a \"new form of warfare\".)\n\nThe goal, Polskin said, was to convey that the trial is \"completely politically motivated\".\n\nStill, is it possible that rather than Fox News devoting too little time to the trial, CNN and MSNBC are devoting too much time to it?\n\nThe Daily Show host Jon Stewart critiqued the media for its coverage of events at the start of trial, such as the former president driving from Trump Tower to the courtroom. During the 2016 presidential election, networks drew big ratings by airing his rallies live and uninterrupted and later faced criticism for giving the candidate free airtime.\n\n\"Perhaps if we limit the coverage to the issues at hand and try not to create an all-encompassing spectacle of the most banal of details. Perhaps that would help,\" Stewart said of the early trial coverage.\n\nOn whether CNN and MSNBC were again spending too much time on Trump, Jamieson said: \"The question always is, what else is in the news agenda? And as a result, what aren't you covering? We are in a relatively quiet period legislatively in the United States, so it's hard to make the argument that there is some big major story that's being downplayed.\"\n\nGertz, of Media Matters for America, points out that Trump has spent the last nine years engaged in a cycle of saying and doing shocking things, followed by rightwing media hosts and pundits condemning backlash against Trump as unfair, so their handling of the trial is not particularly novel.\n\n\"They know that every alleged infraction or crime committed by Trump is an opportunity for them to prove that they are onboard with the Maga movement and with Trump specifically,\" he explained, \"by loudly saying that he did nothing wrong and that his pursuers are in fact the real criminals.\"", "source": {"uri":

And there were lengthy descriptions of what the prosecution argues was an illegal scheme to conceal hush money payments to salvage his then-flailing 2016 campaign.\n\nThrough it all, even as he and his allies attacked the case outside the courtroom, Trump has spent the majority of his time as a criminal defendant sitting nearly motionless for hours, leaning back in his burgundy leather chair with his eyes closed. He ultimately chose not to testify in a case that made him the first former president in the nation's history to stand trial on criminal charges.\n\nClosing arguments in the case are scheduled for Tuesday, after which a jury will decide whether to make him the first former president and major party nominee convicted of felony charges.\n\nTrump's demeanor inside the courtroom has been a notable departure from the fight-at-all-costs persona that has defined him through decades of public life, fueling his transformation from a New York tabloid fixture to a onetime - and possible future - president.\n\nAnd it has been at least partially strategic, according to people familiar with Trump's approach who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the case. Trump's attorneys have warned him that behaving as he did in his previous trials -- where he tangled with judges and stormed out -- could damage his standing with a jury that is likely watching his every move and will determine his fate.\n\nActing out, he appears to have concluded, is not in his best interest, particularly as he faces the risk of imprisonment if he's convicted.\n\nTrump has also been able to speak several times a day to a gaggle of media camped outside the courtroom, giving him an outlet to vent his frustrations and get his message out. Facing a gag order that prohibits him from criticizing witnesses, his campaign has assembled a host of supporters -- from vice presidential contenders to the House speaker -- to deliver those attacks instead.\n\nBut the approach comes with its own risks. Some former prosecutors and attorneys who have been closely following the case said that while disruptive behavior could prove detrimental to the jury, there's also a risk of Trump appearing too disengaged.\n\n\"What you want is for your client to look attentive, respectful and look like nothing is bothering him -- but also not falling asleep,\" said Randall D. Eliason, a former assistant U.S. attorney who for years specialized in white-collar crime.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied reports from journalists watching him via closed-circuit television that he is sleeping in court, insisting on his social media site that he simply closes \"my beautiful blue eyes, sometimes, listen intensely, and take it ALL in!!!\"\n\n\"No, I don't fall asleep,\" he told Telemundo Miami. \"I sometimes will sit back, close my eyes. I hear everything perfectly. At some point I may fall asleep. But I will let you know when that is.\"\n\nEliason said Trump's demeanor was \"definitely\" something jurors would notice and could potentially perceive as disrespectful if they feel \"he's acting like it's not even worth his attention\" or think he's taking a nap.\n\n\"If it's a tactic to try to make it look like he's not concerned about the testimony, I don't think that would play well,\" he said. \"I guess if he's really just sort of listening with eyes closed, meditating or whatever, that doesn't seem so bad. But I think falling asleep, the jury would find quite disrespectful.\"\n\nOn the other hand, he added, \"You don't want him to get really agitated\" as he did during previous trials.\n\nActually, sleeping in court would be highly unusual for a defendant.\n\n\"I have witnessed lawyers fall asleep, but never a defendant in a criminal case. Their lives are at stake and they don't sleep in my experience,\" said Stephen A. Saltzburg, a professor at the George Washington University Law School who has been writing about the case.\n\n\"It's possible it's all an act to show: 'Hey, this is bogus, I'm not going to pay attention to it,'\" he added, but that would also be unhelpful. \"Since the jury has to pay attention, that doesn't send a message that you respect this whole jury process.\"\n\nTrump hasn't been entirely sedated. During jury selection, he appeared alert and engaged, and was at one point reprimanded by the judge for his visible reactions to one juror's answers.\n\n\"(W)hile the juror was at the podium maybe 12 feet from your client, your client was audibly uttering something ... he was audibly gesturing,\" Judge Juan Merchan warned one of his lawyers in April.\n\n\"I won't tolerate that. I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom,\" he went on. \"I want to make that crystal clear.\"\n\nLater, when Stormy Daniels was on the stand, Trump's reaction to her testimony once again prompted Merchan to summon his lawyers to the bench.\n\n\"I understand that your client is upset at this point, but he is cursing audibly, and he is shaking his head visually and that's contemptuous. It has the potential to intimidate the witness and the jury can see that,\" Merchan said, according to the transcript.\n\nBut as the trial dragged on, and particularly during his ex-attorney Michael Cohen's testimony, Trump most often sat in repose, leaning back in his chair, with his eyes closed, his lips pursed and his head tilted back or to the side. He shifted from time to time -- sometimes to scratch an itch. Sometimes he appeared to doze off, his mouth falling agape as he sat for hours in the fluorescent-lit courtroom.\n\nOther times, he re-engaged, sitting upright, chatting with his lawyers or scribbling and passing notes. He often leafed through stacks of papers, looked around the courtroom or sat upright, with his arms folded across his chest. He appeared especially alert and engaged during defense witness Robert Costello's combative testimony, during which the judge threatened to remove Costello from the stand.\n\nBut afterward, he returned to the eyes-closed, head-back position that became his default.\n\nIt's been a marked contrast from his demeanor at his earlier civil trials, when Trump stormed out of the courtroom, actively sparred with judges and made no effort to shield his disdain.\n\nDuring his business fraud civil trial, during which Cohen also testified, Trump blasted a court clerk from the stand, lashed out at the judge and, at one point, marched out of the courtroom. The judge in that case issued Trump a $355 million penalty.\n\nAnd in his E. Jean Carroll defamation case, he was reprimanded for muttering while she spoke, told the judge he would love it if he were removed from the courtroom, and stood up and walked out during Carroll's closing argument, in front of the jury.\n\nSaltzburg said he believes Trump's behavior in that case is one of the reasons the jury awarded her a whopping $83.3 million.\n\n\"They wanted to send a clear message to him and they thought it would take a lot of money to do it,\" he said.\n\nIn this case, said Jeffrey S. Jacobovitz, a trial attorney with extensive experience in white-collar criminal defense, Trump's demeanor is \"something that a jury would certainly notice.\"\n\nThe perception that he's been sleeping \"is likely to have a negative effect on the jury,\" he said, adding, \"I think I would prefer angry Trump.\"\n\nAssociated Press writers Michael R.

But there is a difference between taking A STAND and taking THE STAND. Though there is yet to be a verdict in the hush money trial of former President Donald Trump, we know that Trump has opted not to take the stand.\n\nLet me make this perfectly clear: Trump has a constitutional right not to take the stand (or to take the stand if he so chooses). And this is as it should be. The right to guard against self-incrimination is a tenet of the Constitution. Trump is no exception. Indeed, while it is constantly asserted that no one is above the law, in cases of political leaders it is often forgotten that no one is below the law either.\n\nThat being said, the court of public opinion carries a different standard than the court of law. And that, too, is as it should be. It is incumbent on Trump to be frank with the country after his litigation has ceased. And it will cease someday.\n\nIn the face of Watergate, Richard Nixon thought he was leveling with the American people when he proclaimed \"I am not a crook.\" But he had yet to address the truth behind the Watergate scandal (and had resisted to come clean after both his resignation and his pardon issued by President Gerald R. Ford). Indeed, the most concrete remark by Nixon was his statement to David Frost in a post-resignation interview that if a president does it, it's not a crime.\n\nThis bizarre defense is now being employed by Trump and his attorneys in one of the current U.S. cases. Of course, more preferable is a president and/or former president not to need immunity. That Trump protests at once both innocence and immunity is a contradiction which implies guilt.\n\nNot that implication always translates into guilt. Don't ask me what the verdict(s) will be or whether Trump paid hush money to Stormy Daniels. It seems obvious that Trump had a relationship with Ms. Daniels just as it was obvious that Bill Clinton had sexual relations with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.\n\nThe difference is that Clinton eventually had to level with the American people that he indeed did have a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. And Clinton wasn't faced with a criminal hush money trial (or any trial).\n\nTo be fair, Clinton did lie under oath about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky in a deposition. But he admitted to the indiscretion when under oath before special prosecutor Ken Starr. And let's face it: Trump has a proclivity not unlike Clinton when it comes to marital fidelity and sexual behavior.\n\nThe current hush money trial in state court in New York will in the coming days be going to the jury. Only a fool would bet on the outcome. Then to come is a case in state court in Georgia and two cases involving U.S. authorities in Florida and Washington, D.C. But it's not clear when or if those matters will ever come to trial.\n\nShould a not guilty verdict be forthcoming in the New York trial and/or the Georgia case and U.S. matters, Trump still owes transparency to the public. Whether such transparency is forthcoming is as unpredictable as the trials Trump now faces.", "source": {"uri": "thenewsherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News-Herald"}, "authors":

The former president's base has remained steadfast in its support for him, and Trump's main GOP rival, former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, has even endorsed him, adding to his momentum, reported The Hill.\n\nAlso Read: Trump In Hot Seat In Hush-Money Case, Prosecutors Seek Deep Dive Into Ex-President's Alleged Misconduct And Manipulation\n\nThough things appear relatively favorable for Trump, major obstacles could still emerge, the outlet noted. Here are a few of them.\n\nCriminal Verdict A recent ABC News/Ipsos poll indicated potential felony convictions could sway some of Trump's supporters. However, most of these supporters are likely to remain loyal because they see the prosecutions as politically motivated.\n\nHowever, a conviction would give Democrats a powerful campaign argument and could influence some centrist voters. The outlet reported that a faction of the GOP remains uneasy with Trump, as evidenced by Haley maintaining around 20 percent of support in recent primaries despite suspending her campaign.\n\nConversely, an acquittal in the hush-money case in New York would boost Trump's image and undermine other cases against him. A verdict in New York is expected, with closing arguments beginning on Tuesday.\n\nPresidential Debate Debates between Trump and Biden are scheduled for June 27 and September 10. Trump's performance in these debates will be closely scrutinized, especially given his absence from GOP primary debates.\n\nTrump has taken an unconventional approach to setting expectations by calling Biden \"the worst debater I have ever faced\" and claiming \"he can't put two sentences together.\" Such boasts lower the bar for Biden to clear, according to The Hill.\n\nTrump skipped all GOP primary debates, citing his poll lead, which could leave him rusty by June. The risk isn't just about committing a possible debate gaffe -- with the GOP nomination in sight, Trump will face increased scrutiny on his plans for a second term.\n\nAbortion And The Election Abortion remains a critical issue leading up to the election, with recent measures like Florida's six-week ban potentially affecting Trump's support among suburban female voters. This gives Democrats a key advantage, The Hill pointed out.\n\nSince the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, the GOP has struggled to grapple with the ensuing fallout. Liberals have won every statewide ballot on abortion, even in red states, and Trump blamed the issue for the GOP's poor 2022 midterm results.\n\nA year later, an NBC News poll showed 61% of voters disapproved of the high court's decision. Trump has tried to avoid the issue, stating he doesn't support a federal ban.\n\nUnknown Variables Additionally, Trump's choice of running mate and unforeseen crises could influence the election outcome. Although the former president will most likely overshadow whomever he picks as his second-in-command, the choice is important and could possibly backfire.\n\nFor instance, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R), once a serious contender, faltered after including a bizarre account of killing her dog in her new book, resulting in a disastrous media tour. Ultimately, whoever Trump selects will need to withstand intense scrutiny.\n\nBattleground States In six key battleground states, Trump leads by 3 to 6 points in Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada but by less than 2 points in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. If Biden can win the \"blue wall\" states and Trump takes the southern battlegrounds, Biden would secure reelection by a narrow margin of 270 to 268 electoral votes, according to The Hill.\n\nWhy It Matters: Trump's potential conviction is a significant concern. Jury deliberations are set to begin next week, and a conviction could have profound implications for his campaign.\n\nA recent poll revealed if Trump were found guilty in the hush-money case, 53% indicated the verdict would not affect their stance, while 23% said they would be more likely to vote for him, and 25% said they would be less likely to vote for him.\n\nNow Read: Donald Trump Outmaneuvered Manhattan DA By Gaining Access To Michael Cohen's Emails.

Many of the witnesses in the case come from non-traditional backgrounds or have spent time in prison.\n\nOne might think that people with these types of issues may be bad witnesses in a trial. But during a weekend piece for MSNBC, former federal prosecutor Glenn Kirschner explained why the witnesses could help the prosecution.\n\nNoting that Cohen is, \"a nearly perfect cooperating witness,\" Kirschner continued, \"He was in direct communication with the bigger criminal fish. He even had a covert audio recording that helped prove Trump was involved in the corrupt scheme to hide damaging information for political advantage. Cohen testified that he committed crimes at the direction of Trump and, importantly, for the benefit of Trump.\"\n\nKirschner then wrote:\n\n\"In closing arguments, defense attorneys frequently fall into a trap of urging the jury to disbelieve a cooperating witness' testimony that incriminates their client but believe the same testimony when it incriminates the witness. The defense attorney likely will tell the jury, 'You can't credit Cohen's testimony because he's a thief, having stolen from the very person he, as an attorney, was supposed to zealously represent.'

The trial is nearing its end this week, with closing arguments set to begin Tuesday.\n\n\"Donald Trump runs on motor oil, by the way. He runs on motor oil. He's a machine,\" Rep. Troy Nehls (R-Texas) told HuffPost when asked about the significance of the naps.\n\n\"We ought to be talking about Sleepy Joe,\" Nehls said, using one of Trump's favored monikers for Biden.\n\n\"It's not even close between Trump and Biden,\" said Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who recently announced his desire to become the next Republican leader in the Senate, a bid that could be buoyed by his closeness to Trump.\n\n\"No sane person in this country is going to vote for Biden,\" Scott said.\n\nNone of the Republicans queried brought up Trump's defense of his apparent napping: that he wasn't actually asleep at all.\n\n\"I simply close my beautiful blue eyes, sometimes, listen intensely, and take it ALL in!!!\" Trump posted on his social media site in an apparent response to the accounts of him nodding off.\n\nThe reports of Trump's snoozing have been catnip for Democrats.\n\nRep. Robert Garcia (R-Calif.), at the infamous committee meeting where Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) got into a heated argument, displayed a blown-up picture of Trump with his eyes closed as he recounted the various times Trump had been reported as sleeping at the trial.\n\n\"I bring this up because it's Donald Trump that's asleep, and it's hurting and dividing our country,\" not Biden, Garcia said.\n\nThe photo Garcia used during the hearing was not from inside the courtroom, Garcia told HuffPost, explaining his staff found the shot of Trump with his eyes closed at some other moment.\n\nBut there is a photo of Trump resting his eyes during the trial, captured on May 16 by a press pool photographer for the trial and distributed by The Associated Press.\n\nTrump was also captured by a courtroom sketch artist with his eyes closed during jury selection for the trial.\n\n\"It's hypocrisy,\" Garcia said Thursday. \"Someone that actually can't stay awake when he's in a criminal hearing and the president is out there doing a bunch of things, campaigning hard.\"\n\nSome Republicans acknowledged Trump was indeed asleep but said it didn't matter because trials are boring.\n\n\"We have a courtroom that is the most depressing thing I've ever been in,\" Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) told reporters outside the Manhattan courthouse on May 13. \"Mental anguish is trying to be pushed on the Republican candidate for the president of the United States.\"\n\nRep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) told HuffPost that Trump may be tired because he gets up early and \"goes pretty hard.\"\n\n\"I really don't have a problem with all that. You sit in there long enough, anybody -- just the mundane nature of a case, just dividing sentences up, what was said, who said it -- it just gets old,\" Burchett said.\n\n\"Sleeping? Anybody would do that. It's like watching paint dry,\" said Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), who, like Scott, Nehls and Tuberville, made the trip up to New York City to show public solidarity with the presumed Republican presidential nominee.\n\n\"It's the most unfair trial and the most boring trial and Trump has every right to go to sleep,\" Norman said.\n\nBurchett said the circumstances of Trump's dozing should not be held against him, noting he himself had fallen asleep in church.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HuffPost", "type": "wiki",

The ex-fixer, who worked for the Republican front-runner for over a decade, also revealed the politician's reaction to his infidelities, allegedly unbothered by the possibility of Melania Trump leaving him.\n\nIn his book, Disloyal: The True Story of the Former Personal Attorney to President Donald J Trump, Cohen revealed that Donald seemed unfazed because he \"can always get another wife,\" The Sun reported. The now-77-year-old allegedly told Cohen, \"I can always get another wife. That's no problem for me, if she wants to go...so be it.\"\n\nCohen explained that Donald would not be 'upset or hurt' if Melania were ever to threaten to leave because his marriage is \"just another deal...plain and simple.\" In the wake of adult film star, Stormy Daniels' allegations, the now-57-year-old had cautioned his ex-boss that his wife would be furious. \"I'm sure Melania isn't going to take this well,\" Cohen recounted having asked Donald.\n\nTo his surprise, the Republican front-runner, responded, \"Don't forget I'm married to an Eastern European woman. They don't play around when it comes to this kind of stuff.\" Cohen also alleged that Donald wanted Daniels to be on The Apprentice for 'better ratings'. He recounted the twice-indicted president telling him, \"Man, she would have been great for ratings. And great for me.\" Additionally, Cohen also recalled a phone call with Melania. \"Melania didn't sound pleased to be on the phone. I knew Mrs Trump well and I could tell instantly from the tone of voice that she had been compelled to participate in the call,\" he wrote in the book.\n\n\"As I droned on about the Daniels affair, I was interrupted by the First Lady. 'I know all of this.' It was evident to me she didn't believe the story or want anything further to do with the transparent lies the President was childishly attempting to tell her via me. As usual with the Trumps when this kind of subject came up the First Lady changed the subject,\" Cohen explained.\n\nOriginally published on September 8, 2020, Disloyal was Cohen's attempt to publicly acknowledge or 'reverse' what he's done while working for Donald. The memoir was the lawyer's act of 'redemption'. But, his claims about Donald also succeeded in painting him in a bad light. The Trump White House condemned Cohen's accounts. \"Cohen is a disgraced felon and disbarred lawyer, who lied to Congress,\" said former press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, as per BBC. \"He has lost all credibility, and it's unsurprising to see his latest attempt to profit off of lies.\" However, as Donald's hush money trial unfolds in New York, several witnesses have come forward and corroborated some of Cohen's claims.", "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Inquisitr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apprentice_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Apprentice (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disbarment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disbarment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayleigh_McEnany", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kayleigh McEnany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/694650/uploads/f471f400-169d-11ef-b3c0-bd671d4087e7_800_420.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598874", "eventUri": "eng-9598874", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-09-08", "textStart": 2135, "textEnd": 2152}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 97, "relevance": 1}

Plus, \"Meet the Press\" moderator Kristen Welker dives into how voters are feeling about the state of American democracy.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has largely steered clear of former President Donald Trump's legal woes. But with a verdict in the hush money trial coming as soon as next week, Biden's campaign is exploring a shift to a new, more aggressive posture, according to two people familiar with the strategy.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, top Biden campaign officials plan to stress to voters that Trump will be on the ballot in the fall and that no potential court proceeding will change that fact.\n\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know\n\nA person familiar with the discussions summed it up this way: \"Donald Trump's legal troubles are not going to keep him out of the White House. Only one thing will do that: voting this November for Joe Biden.\"\n\nIf Trump is found guilty at his trial in New York City, the Biden campaign will also have to consider whether to brand him as a \"convicted felon,\" this person added. \"It's an open question.\"\n\nThe campaign views the conclusion of the trial as one of the 2024 election's inflection points, when the minute-by-minute sideshow of courtroom drama will end and the time for voters to focus on what's at stake in November will arrive, one of the sources said.\n\nThe Biden team expects to send a message that if Trump is acquitted, or if there is a hung jury, voters shouldn't wait for the outcome of his other legal issues to be determinative, either.\n\nFor the most part, Biden has been careful about directly commenting on the trial, avoiding playing into Trump's narrative that his legal issues amount to election interference from the Biden administration.\n\nBut the president made a splash last week when, in a video posted to social media, he agreed to debate Trump, musing, \"I hear you're free on Wednesdays.\" Biden was referring to Trump's courtroom schedule, which has allowed a day off each Wednesday. The line was widely shared across social media platforms, and the campaign started selling T-shirts with it.\n\nRead more \u2192\n\nSo many issues are at stake in November -- the economy, abortion, immigration, foreign affairs, even the future of the Supreme Court.\n\nBut also hanging over the 2024 election is the state of America's democracy.\n\nJust take a look at these data points:\n\nEighty-one percent of voters -- including supermajorities of both Democrats and Republicans -- believe democracy in America is under threat, according to a recent Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service poll.\n\nNearly a third of voters feel so strongly about it that they say they will vote for or against a candidate solely on that issue, last month's national NBC News poll showed.\n\nA national CNN poll also found last month that a third of voters -- including 68% of Republicans -- said they did not believe that President Joe Biden won the 2020 election, confirming that election denialism remains in the background of the 2024 contest.\n\nAnother third of voters say they're not confident votes in the election will be counted accurately, according to a recent national Quinnipiac University poll.\n\nHalf of swing state voters worry about political violence resulting from the election and its aftermath, according to the latest Bloomberg/Morning Consult polling.\n\nAnd then there's this: Nearly 40% of the local election officials surveyed this year by the Brennan Center for Justice said they have experienced threats, harassment or abuse.\n\nThat includes four secretaries of state -- from Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania -- who will join me this Sunday to talk about the threats they and their families faced in the aftermath of the 2020 election.\n\nFor more on these issues and many more, tune into \"Meet the Press\" this Sunday for a bipartisan conversation about America's democracy -- and how to safeguard it.\n\nThat's all from The Politics Desk for now.

We are experimenting with our new artist series giveaway tomorrow. Enjoy the Joel Mesler created totebag. Feedback appreciated.\"\n\nUnfortunately for Cohen though, his excitement quickly turned into dismay as the Mets went on to lose that night in truly horrendous fashion. The team embarrassingly blew a 6-2 lead with two outs in the eighth inning to the San Francisco Giants and went on to fall by an 8-7 final score.\n\n\"What a stretch, mind boggling,\" Cohen wrote in a post after the game. \"I know how disheartening this is for our fans. Ty for caring so much.\"\n\nThe set of back-to-back posts by Cohen quickly created a hilariously sad visual that went viral online.\n\nThat definitely sums up the New York Mets experience this season pretty well. They are now 21-29 on the year and continued to humiliate themselves during the next day's game against the Giants too.\n\nAs for Cohen, it could always be worse.

At the end of his long career and incredible life, Leonard Cohen, now a celebrated artist, was still a writer. That one vocation serves as the key to every other role he took on and everything he ever made. Really, the only way to understand the music is to engage with the poetry.\n\nCohen was a relative latecomer to music. It wasn't until 1967 that he began to put any real effort into making and releasing music, already aged 33. For people who look at him just as a musician, Cohen's story starts slowly and somewhat randomly. It could be seen that he just landed in New York with a few songs, keen to integrate into the new folk scene there. After Judy Collins made his song 'Suzanne' a hit, that moment could be marked as the start of his career.\n\nBut the truth of his story started long before that. Cohen began as a writer, planning to always and only be a writer. From being a young school child in Canada, where he met his teacher and mentor Irving Layton, his interest was captured by poetry. With Layton's signature \"tell it like it is\" style, merged with the richer, more imagery-driven works he was learning back through his interest in Spanish Poetry and Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, those two key inspirations serve as a perfect blueprint for Cohen's own style.\n\nThat dual voice, merging the spontaneous and straight with the flowery and thought-out, is seen in his lyricism. But most evidently, it's seen in his poetry. In his collection, Book Of Longing, each new page seems to flit between them. One poem, 'The Sweetest Little Song', reads only, \"You go your way / I'll go your way too\". Two pages on, 'Stanzas for H.M' is almost more like a Keats piece than any modern piece, opening, \"O perfect gentleman, and champion / of the Royal Throne; O unbroken stone\". As Cohen moved between the two schools of writing he was raised on, his own language found unique ground that was somehow able to be grand yet intimate and organic.\n\nIt is impossible to separate Cohen, the musician, from Cohen, the writer, because one seemed to fall accidentally out of the other. From those early days in school, he appeared to be wandering down a singular path. Cohen would be a writer. He went to school and studied as he wrote poetry, publishing his first collection in 1956 and several more after. When he finished school, he wandered off to the Greek island of Hydra, where he wrote more poetry as well as his debut novel, The Favourite Game. This was his plan. He was going to write books and poems and be a celebrated writer like his heroes of Layton, Lorca, Walt Whitman or William Butler Yeats.\n\nBefore Cohen had any music out, he was already well-established with four poetry collections and two novels. In the traditional sense, he had the mental process and work ethic of a writer, dealing with his ideas and thoughts through the lens of poetry or prose rather than songs. So even when things did switch, and he turned his attention to music after failing to get the attention he hoped for as a writer, that mindset never changed.\n\nA well-known fact about Cohen is that the man was an obsessive perfectionist. Songs would often take him years to complete, being drafted over and over with countless verses written and then reworked. \"To know my father was (among many other wondrous things) to know a man with papers, notebooks, and cocktail napkins -- distinguished handwriting on each -- scattered (neatly) everywhere,\" Adam Cohen said of his father, recalling his habit for working a song over and over again.\n\nFamously, his hit 'Hallelujah' took him years to complete as he wrote somewhere between 80 and 180 drafted verses. Even as it stands, with six verses that meander through a series of rich images, 'Hallelujah' is more like an epic poem than any typical song. The same goes for 'So Long Marianne', one of his earliest tracks, which always feels more like a piece of writing that happens to be sung rather than a song specifically crafted to a strict rhythm or style.\n\nIt always felt that Cohen refused to sacrifice his poetry for any constraints of music, leading to the exact type of dense, lyrical compositions he made and his history of demos, drafts and long-lost older versions. With his slow, careful process, his songwriting feels more like book editing than the divine strikes of inspiration that other musicians claim to have. \"If it is your destiny to be this labourer called a writer, you know that you've got to go to work every day, but you also know that you're not gonna get it every day,\" he said of his process, which was always more rooted in real work, than a flouncy artist. The idea of going to work daily feels more like the slow and dedicated work of the novelist he started out as.\n\nSome of those early drafts exist first amongst his poetry. 'A Thousand Kisses Deep' is found in its original form in Book Of Longing, clearly first written for the page before being adapted to music. But perhaps more so than any of his poetic lyrical peers, Cohen blurred the lines between the two forms completely. \"All of my writing has guitars behind it, even the novels,\" he said of his work, proving that to him, music and writing were always one and the same, but also that his role as a writer was still held firmly, even when he was a musician.\n\nReally, it was in the years before Cohen made any music that his future was set. In the years he spent writing and only writing, he drew out the blueprint for the voice and style the world would come to know best through his songs.

The British government has said it's up to Ukraine how to use missiles supplied by the U.K., as long as international law is upheld.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Zelenskyy said he was seeking clarification about Ukraine's ability to use Storm Shadow missiles supplied by Britain against targets in Russia. The Storm Shadow is an air-launched cruise missile with a range of more than 250 kilometers (155 miles).\n\n\"We need a decision about long-distance weapons, long range, to use it,\" Zelenskyy said. \"We need it very much. They're targeting our hospitals, schools. We just want to answer exactly to the point where from they target us.\"\n\nU.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said Ukraine already has permission to use the missiles against Russia, but the rules for exactly what can be targeted and under what circumstances are \"complex questions\" that are the subject of intense negotiations.\n\n\"We're providing weapons to Ukraine for their defense of their sovereign country, and that does not preclude them hitting targets in Russia, but that must be done by the Ukrainians. It must be done within the parameters and the bounds of international humanitarian law,\" Healey told the BBC.\n\nThe United States, Ukraine's biggest military backer, recently shifted its position, with the Pentagon saying last month that Ukraine could use longer-range missiles provided by the U.S. to strike targets inside Russia if it is acting in self-defense.\n\nSince the beginning of Russia's 2022 invasion, the U.S. had maintained a policy of not allowing Ukraine to use the weapons it provided to hit targets inside Russia for fear of further escalation.\n\nZelenskyy received a standing ovation from Starmer's government as he entered the Cabinet room at 10 Downing St. The last foreign leader invited to address a Cabinet meeting in person was U.S. President Bill Clinton in 1997.\n\nZelenskyy briefed ministers on the situation in Ukraine and the need for European countries to ramp up defense production in the face of Russian aggression.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine had repelled Russian attempts to advance on northeastern Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, showing that \"we can stop any Russian attempt to expand the war.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian army is having a harder time in the eastern Donetsk region, however. That's where a pulverizing Russian onslaught in recent months has forced Kyiv's troops to withdraw from some towns and villages.\n\nThe latest targets are the mining town of Toretsk and the city of Pokrovsk, where Russia is stepping up its assaults. Ukrainian forces repelled 20 and 27 attacks on those areas respectively over the previous 24 hours, Ukraine's General Staff said Friday. That was almost double the number of assaults recorded at other hot spots along the front line, it said.\n\nStarmer, whose center-left Labour Party government was elected two weeks ago, is keen to stress that the U.K.'s strong support for Ukraine will continue on his watch.\n\nStarmer said the U.K. would \"double down\" on support for Ukraine, including with a treaty that aims to help both countries ramp up military production. The U.K. is also giving Ukraine access to 3.5 billion pounds ($4.5 billion) of export financing to purchase weapons.\n\n\"Ukraine is, and always will be, at the heart of this government's agenda, and so it is only fitting that President Zelenskyy will make a historic address to my Cabinet,\" Starmer said in a statement. \"Russia's incremental gains on the battlefield are nothing compared with the collective international support for Ukraine, or the strength of ties between our people.\"\n\nDuring a visit to Britain that included a summit of the European Political Community on Thursday, Ukraine's president repeated his increasingly urgent calls for more ammunition and weapons and tougher sanctions on Russia.\n\nEuropean leaders at the summit agreed to tighten sanctions against a \"shadow fleet\" of hundreds of illegitimate and often decrepit ships the West says Russia is using to transport oil and evade sanctions.\n\nLeaders expressed support for Ukraine and concern about the direction of the United States on Thursday at the security-focused summit, which was clouded by worries about whether the U.S. will remain a reliable ally if Donald Trump wins a second presidency.",

It has also launched missile and drone attacks across Ukraine, killing dozens and hitting targets including a Kyiv children's hospital.\n\nSome of Kyiv's allies are reluctant to let Ukraine use their weapons to strike Russian territory because of concerns that the West could be drawn into direct conflict with Russia. The British government has said it's up to Ukraine how to use missiles supplied by the U.K., as long as international law is upheld.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Zelenskyy said he was seeking clarification about Ukraine's ability to use Storm Shadow missiles supplied by Britain against targets in Russia. The Storm Shadow is an air-launched cruise missile with a range of more than 250 kilometers (155 miles).\n\n\"We need a decision about long-distance weapons, long range, to use it,\" Zelenskyy said. \"We need it very much. They're targeting our hospitals, schools. We just want to answer exactly to the point where from they target us.\"\n\nU.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said Ukraine already has permission to use the missiles against Russia, but the rules for exactly what can be targeted and under what circumstances are \"complex questions\" that are the subject of intense negotiations.\n\n\"We're providing weapons to Ukraine for their defense of their sovereign country, and that does not preclude them hitting targets in Russia, but that must be done by the Ukrainians. It must be done within the parameters and the bounds of international humanitarian law,\" Healey told the BBC.\n\nThe United States, Ukraine's biggest military backer, recently shifted its position, with the Pentagon saying last month that Ukraine could use longer-range missiles provided by the U.S. to strike targets inside Russia if it is acting in self-defense.\n\nSince the beginning of Russia's 2022 invasion, the U.S. had maintained a policy of not allowing Ukraine to use the weapons it provided to hit targets inside Russia for fear of further escalation.\n\nZelenskyy received a standing ovation from Starmer's government as he entered the Cabinet room at 10 Downing St. The last foreign leader invited to address a Cabinet meeting in person was U.S. President Bill Clinton in 1997.\n\nZelenskyy briefed ministers on the situation in Ukraine and the need for European countries to ramp up defense production in the face of Russian aggression.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine had repelled Russian attempts to advance on northeastern Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, showing that \"we can stop any Russian attempt to expand the war.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian army is having a harder time in the eastern Donetsk region, however. That's where a pulverizing Russian onslaught in recent months has forced Kyiv's troops to withdraw from some towns and villages.\n\nThe latest targets are the mining town of Toretsk and the city of Pokrovsk, where Russia is stepping up its assaults. Ukrainian forces repelled 20 and 27 attacks on those areas respectively over the previous 24 hours, Ukraine's General Staff said Friday. That was almost double the number of assaults recorded at other hot spots along the front line, it said.\n\nStarmer, whose center-left Labour Party government was elected two weeks ago, is keen to stress that the U.K.'s strong support for Ukraine will continue on his watch.\n\nStarmer said the U.K. would \"double down\" on support for Ukraine, including with a treaty that aims to help both countries ramp up military production. The U.K. is also giving Ukraine access to 3.5 billion pounds ($4.5 billion) of export financing to purchase weapons.\n\n\"Ukraine is, and always will be, at the heart of this government's agenda, and so it is only fitting that President Zelenskyy will make a historic address to my Cabinet,\" Starmer said in a statement. \"Russia's incremental gains on the battlefield are nothing compared with the collective international support for Ukraine, or the strength of ties between our people.\"\n\nDuring a visit to Britain that included a summit of the European Political Community on Thursday, Ukraine's president repeated his increasingly urgent calls for more ammunition and weapons and tougher sanctions on Russia.\n\nEuropean leaders at the summit agreed to tighten sanctions against a \"shadow fleet\" of hundreds of illegitimate and often decrepit ships the West says Russia is using to transport oil and evade sanctions.\n\nLeaders expressed support for Ukraine and concern about the direction of the United States on Thursday at the security-focused summit, which was clouded by worries about whether the U.S. will remain a reliable ally if Donald Trump wins a second presidency.\n\n___\n\nSamya Kullab in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source": {"uri":

It has also launched missile and drone attacks across Ukraine, killing dozens and hitting targets including a Kyiv children's hospital.\n\nSome of Kyiv's allies are reluctant to let Ukraine use their weapons to strike Russian territory because of concerns that the West could be drawn into direct conflict with Russia. The British government has said it's up to Ukraine how to use missiles supplied by the U.K., as long as international law is upheld.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Zelenskyy said he was seeking clarification about Ukraine's ability to use Storm Shadow missiles supplied by Britain against targets in Russia. The Storm Shadow is an air-launched cruise missile with a range of more than 250 kilometers (155 miles).\n\n\"We need a decision about long-distance weapons, long range, to use it,\" Zelenskyy said. \"We need it very much. They're targeting our hospitals, schools. We just want to answer exactly to the point where from they target us.\"\n\nU.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said Ukraine already has permission to use the missiles against Russia, but the rules for exactly what can be targeted and under what circumstances are \"complex questions\" that are the subject of intense negotiations.\n\n\"We're providing weapons to Ukraine for their defense of their sovereign country, and that does not preclude them hitting targets in Russia, but that must be done by the Ukrainians. It must be done within the parameters and the bounds of international humanitarian law,\" Healey told the BBC.\n\nThe United States, Ukraine's biggest military backer, recently shifted its position, with the Pentagon saying last month that Ukraine could use longer-range missiles provided by the U.S. to strike targets inside Russia if it is acting in self-defense.\n\nSince the beginning of Russia's 2022 invasion, the U.S. had maintained a policy of not allowing Ukraine to use the weapons it provided to hit targets inside Russia for fear of further escalation.\n\nZelenskyy received a standing ovation from Starmer's government as he entered the Cabinet room at 10 Downing St. The last foreign leader invited to address a Cabinet meeting in person was U.S. President Bill Clinton in 1997.\n\nZelenskyy briefed ministers on the situation in Ukraine and the need for European countries to ramp up defense production in the face of Russian aggression.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine had repelled Russian attempts to advance on northeastern Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, showing that \"we can stop any Russian attempt to expand the war.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian army is having a harder time in the eastern Donetsk region, however. That's where a pulverizing Russian onslaught in recent months has forced Kyiv's troops to withdraw from some towns and villages.\n\nThe latest targets are the mining town of Toretsk and the city of Pokrovsk, where Russia is stepping up its assaults. Ukrainian forces repelled 20 and 27 attacks on those areas respectively over the previous 24 hours, Ukraine's General Staff said Friday. That was almost double the number of assaults recorded at other hot spots along the front line, it said.\n\nStarmer, whose center-left Labour Party government was elected two weeks ago, is keen to stress that the U.K.'s strong support for Ukraine will continue on his watch.\n\nStarmer said the U.K. would \"double down\" on support for Ukraine, including with a treaty that aims to help both countries ramp up military production. The U.K. is also giving Ukraine access to 3.5 billion pounds ($4.5 billion) of export financing to purchase weapons.\n\n\"Ukraine is, and always will be, at the heart of this government's agenda, and so it is only fitting that President Zelenskyy will make a historic address to my Cabinet,\" Starmer said in a statement. \"Russia's incremental gains on the battlefield are nothing compared with the collective international support for Ukraine, or the strength of ties between our people.\"\n\nDuring a visit to Britain that included a summit of the European Political Community on Thursday, Ukraine's president repeated his increasingly urgent calls for more ammunition and weapons and tougher sanctions on Russia.\n\nEuropean leaders at the summit agreed to tighten sanctions against a \"shadow fleet\" of hundreds of illegitimate and often decrepit ships the West says Russia is using to transport oil and evade sanctions.\n\nLeaders expressed support for Ukraine and concern about the direction of the United States on Thursday at the security-focused summit, which was clouded by worries about whether the U.S. will remain a reliable ally if Donald Trump wins a second presidency.\n\n___\n\nSamya Kullab in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source": {"uri":

Some Kyiv allies are reluctant to provide such authorization because of concerns it could draw the West into direct conflict with Russia.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine needed the missiles to counter Russian attacks on his country.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, left, receives Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy outside 10 Downing Street in London, Friday, July 19, 2024. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung)\n\n\"We need very strong support from (the) prime minister,\" he told the BBC. \"We need a decision about long distance weapons, long range, to use it. We need it very much. They\u00b4re targeting our hospitals, schools. We just want to answer exactly to the point where from they target us.\"\n\nThe Storm Shadow is an air-launched cruise missile with a range of more than 250 kilometers (155 miles).\n\nU.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said Ukraine already has permission to use the missiles against targets in Russia, but the rules for exactly what can be targeted and under what circumstances are \"complex questions\" that are the subject of intense negotiations.\n\n\"We're providing weapons to Ukraine for their defense of their sovereign country, and that does not preclude them hitting targets in Russia, but that must be done by the Ukrainians. It must be done within the parameters and the bounds of international humanitarian law,\" Healey told the BBC.\n\nLeaders from across Europe expressed support for Ukraine and concern about the direction of the United States on Thursday at a security-focused summit in the U.K. clouded by worries about whether the U.S. will remain a reliable ally if Donald Trump wins a second presidency.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, right, and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak during a bilateral meeting at 10 Downing Street in London, Friday July 19, 2024.

He referenced Zelenskyy's previous request for additional air defenses before the new school year, stating:\n\n\"That really struck me because returning to school after the summer break, that should be a moment of joy, of excitement for children, new uniforms, new exercise books, saying how much their friends have grown over the summer holidays and reuniting with friends. How could anyone consider that a target?\"\n\nAddressing the summit, Zelenskyy warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin might attempt to approach individual countries or parties to undermine the group, potentially \"trying to tempt or pressure you or blackmail you so that one of you betrays the rest,\" SkyNews reports.\n\nHe emphasized that the use of Western weapons has not escalated the war with Russia and called for fewer restrictions on Ukraine's use of these armaments, saying,\n\n\"The fewer restrictions we have on the use of effective weapons, the more Russia will seek peace.\"\n\nZelenskyy specifically appealed to the US, UK, France, Germany, Poland, and \"other friends\" to provide additional resources, particularly for shooting down drones. He concluded by urging nations to continue their diplomatic support for Ukraine.\n\nAccording to Zelenskyy's Telegram message, his UK visit includes meetings with King Charles III, Prime Minister Starmer, government officials, and defense company executives. He plans to sign an intergovernmental agreement on supporting Ukraine's defense industry and discuss future defense cooperation.\n\nThis marks the fourth European Political Community summit, with the first having taken place in Prague, Czech Republic, on 6 October 2022.\n\nIn January 2024, Ukraine and the United Kingdom signed a security agreement that provides for a 100-year partnership, annual

The PM said the summit was an opportunity to \"set a new path on illegal migration\" and say \"no more\" to the \"crisis\" of people smuggling.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benjamin_lynch@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Benjamin Lynch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blenheim_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blenheim Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Political_Community_(2022)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Political Community (2022)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Opening_of_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State Opening of Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smuggling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smuggling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical_Personages", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical Personages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33276226.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Leaders-Meet-For-The-European-Political-Community-Summit.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743623", "eventUri": "eng-9743623", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

People targeted on our streets. Military planes entering our air space. Ships patrolling our coastlines,' he said, adding 'this is the moment for us all to do more.'\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a key guest at the summit, spoke soon after, praising European support for Ukraine, saying, 'Putin cannot sustain relationships with truly strong leaders. And this is our advantage.'\n\nBut Zelenskyy warned, 'It remains an advantage only as long as we are united.'\n\nZelenskyy, without mentioning Prime Minister Orban by name, called out the Hungarian leader's recent visit to Moscow.\n\n'If someone in Europe tries to resolve issues behind others' backs, or even at the expense of someone else,' Zelenskyy said, 'if someone wants to make some trips to the capital of war to talk and perhaps promise something against our common interests, or to the expense of Ukraine or other countries, then why should we consider such a person?'\n\nHungary assumed the rotating presidency of the European Union on July 1, and on July 5, Orban traveled to Moscow, where he met with Putin on what he called a 'peace mission.' Orban also visited Kyiv, where he met with Zelenskyy, and took trips to Beijing, and the United States, where he met with former U.S. president Donald Trump.\n\nOrban is also attending the summit in Britain. As he arrived, he told reporters he supported Ukraine, but added that he does not believe Ukraine can defeat Russia and the conflict cannot be resolved on the battlefield. He said he supports a cease-fire and negotiations to end the war.\n\nAhead of the meeting, on his official account on the X social media platform, Zelenskyy said while in Britain, he would hold a separate meeting with Starmer, and they would 'sign an intergovernmental agreement on support for the Ukrainian defense and industrial complex,' as well as discuss future defense cooperation.\n\nZelenskyy said he also would meet with King Charles.\n\nFILE - Soldiers stand in line at a training site as they undergo maintenance training on Leopard 1 A5 tanks, at the German army Bundeswehr base, part of the EU Military Assistance Mission in support of Ukraine in Klietz, Germany, Feb. 23, 2024.\n\nNew NATO command for Ukraine\n\nAhead of the meeting NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday the alliance's new command for coordinating military aid and training for Ukraine's military - to be located in Germany - will be operational in September. The command will be led by a three-star general with a team of 700 personnel.\n\nNATO leaders agreed at a summit earlier this month to launch the effort, with the aim of better coordinating Ukraine aid efforts and making that assistance more predictable.\n\nStoltenberg spoke ahead of a meeting of about 50 European leaders in Britain. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was also taking part in the summit and said he expected to sign new security agreements.\n\nUkraine's military said Thursday it intercepted 16 Russian aerial drones and two guided missiles that targeted Ukraine in overnight attacks.\n\nThe Ukrainian air force said the intercepts took place over the Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Poltava and Zaporizhzhia regions.\n\nSerhiy Lysak, the regional governor of Dnipropetrovsk, said on Telegram the Russian attacks injured two people and damaged 14 residential buildings.\n\nThreats of aerial attacks prompted alarms in Kyiv, but Ukrainian air defenses shot down Russian drones before they reached the area, according to Serhiy Popko, head of the Kyiv city administration.\n\nRussia's defense ministry said Thursday it destroyed 33 Ukrainian aerial drones and 10 naval drones.\n\nThe naval drones were heading toward the Russia-occupied Crimean Peninsula, while the aerial drones were shot down over Crimea and Bryansk, the ministry said.\n\nBryansk Governor Aleksandr Bogomaz reported on Telegram there were no casualties or damage in his area.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov told the Aspen Security Forum on Wednesday that 500,000 Russian troops are surrounding Ukraine and Russia is looking to add 200,000 to 300,000 more in the coming months.\n\nHe told the annual meeting in Aspen, Colorado, that 550,000 Russians have been killed or wounded so far in the 2-year-old war and that Russia is relying heavily on mercenaries, including those from Africa.\n\nOn Ukraine's push to loosen restrictions by the U.S. and some others on the use of long-range weapons against targets deep inside Russia, Umerov said, 'We want to change it from a limit on length to a focus on functional[ity].'\n\n'The work is still in progress,' he added. 'We want to say it loudly. We are focusing on the military targets.'\n\nRussia and Ukraine swapped 95 prisoners each on Wednesday, exchanging 190 prisoners in total.\n\nIt was the third prisoner swap between the two countries in seven weeks - the 54th since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The United Arab Emirates helps facilitate the swaps, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the UAE for assisting in Wednesday's exchange.\n\nVOA National Security Correspondent Jeff Seldin contributed to this story.

Some Kyiv allies are reluctant to provide such authorization because of concerns it could draw the West into direct conflict with Russia.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine needed the missiles to counter Russian attacks on his country.\n\n\"We need very strong support from (the) prime minister,\" he told the BBC. \"We need a decision about long distance weapons, long range, to use it. We need it very much. They're targeting our hospitals, schools. We just want to answer exactly to the point where from they target us.\"\n\nThe Storm Shadow is an air-launched cruise missile with a range of more than 250 kilometers (155 miles).\n\nU.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said Ukraine already has permission to use the missiles against targets in Russia, but the rules for exactly what can be targeted and under what circumstances are \"complex questions\" that are the subject of intense negotiations.\n\n\"We're providing weapons to Ukraine for their defense of their sovereign country, and that does not preclude them hitting targets in Russia, but that must be done by the Ukrainians. It must be done within the parameters and the bounds of international humanitarian law,\" Healey told the BBC.\n\nLeaders from across Europe expressed support for Ukraine and concern about the direction of the United States on Thursday at a security-focused summit in the U.K. clouded by worries about whether the U.S. will remain a reliable ally if Donald Trump wins a second presidency.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Our European values remain the same and consistent, regardless of what any other country decides to do\" said Simon Harris, Prime Minister of Ireland, referring to the upcoming election in the United States.\n\nHarris thinks it is important that the European family prepares to stand by Ukraine for however long it takes and hopes that in other parts of the world, including the US, support for Ukraine will remain strong.\n\nAs the possibility of a \"Trump presidency\" rises, Europe feels the need to take its own steps and measures for defence. \"European countries must stand on their own legs more than ever,\" Netherlands Prime Minister Dick Schoof said.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by several other leaders, but not by Hungary's pro-Russia Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n. He said a Trump victory would be \"the best news for everybody because he's a man of the people.\"\n\nZelenskyy appeared to refer to Orb\u00e1n when he urged European nations to remain united.\n\n\"If someone wants to make some trips to the capital of war to talk and perhaps promise something against our common interests, or to the expense of Ukraine or other countries, then why should we consider such a person?\" Zelenskyy said. \"The EU and NATO can also address all their issues without this one individual.\"\n\nDonald Trump already has bad relations with Ukraine's President Zelenskyy having tried to blackmail him in 2019 by threatening to withhold military aid.\n\nTrump's pick for Vice president J.D. Vance has regularly stated he doesn't agree with military support for Ukraine.\n\n\"A very important commitment was made again today, including supporting energy needs ahead of winter. So, getting ahead of this winter and cracking down on the ships that are helping Russia to evade sanctions. Now, we need to be clear,\" said Starmer and reaffirmed his pledge to support Ukraine for as long as it takes.\n\n\"Ukraine is fighting not just for the Ukrainian people, but for the European people, for freedom, democracy and the rule of law. And our security therefore starts in Ukraine,\" he said.\n\nThe new UK government says it was also a reason to reset relations and reaffirm the continent's defence of Ukraine.\n\nThe venue for the European Political Community summit, Blenheim Palace, was the birthplace of Britain's World War II Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Starmer said the leaders were meeting \"as a new storm gathers over our continent.\"\n\nEuronews correspondent Shona Murray notes that the EPC coinciding with the Republican National Convention is helpful as it gives the European continent the first chance to prepare for a more hostile US.\n\n\"Although the subject matters from today - defence, democracy and illegal migration are shared issues with the US, there is at least a tactic acknowledgement from many leaders that depending on who is in the White House will decide how well these matters are resolved\" Murray reports.\n\nAmid a surge in far-right extremism across the globe, another major topic in the EPC was migration.\n\nA brainchild of Macron, the EPC was established in 2022 as a forum for countries both inside and outside the 27-nation EU after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine shattered Europe's sense of security.

That is why we have once again promised President Zelenskyy that we will stand with Ukraine, as we have done before, and we will support Ukraine, as we have done, for as long as it takes,\" the British Prime Minister said.\n\nHe emphasised that support for Ukraine \"remains as strong as it has ever been\" and, obviously, \"has become even stronger with 46 European leaders here today\".\n\nStarmer stressed that the UK will continue to play a leading role in supporting Ukraine's efforts to repel Russian aggression. \"I am very proud of the role we have played in relation to Ukraine. It was a leading role.

The U.K. is also giving Ukraine access to 3.5 billion pounds ($4.5 billion) of export financing to purchase weapons.\n\n\"Ukraine is, and always will be, at the heart of this government's agenda, and

collective international support for Ukraine, or the strength of ties between our people.\"\n\nDuring a visit to Britain that included a summit of the European Political Community on Thursday, Ukraine's president repeated his increasingly urgent calls for more ammunition and weapons and tougher sanctions on Russia.\n\nEuropean leaders at the summit agreed to tighten sanctions against a \"shadow fleet\" of hundreds of illegitimate and often decrepit ships the West says Russia is using to transport oil and evade sanctions.\n\nLeaders expressed support for Ukraine and concern about the

However, the United Kingdom has clarified that it has not permitted Ukraine to use Storm Shadow missiles inside Russian territory, contradicting earlier statements. This clarification has created an awkward diplomatic moment for Sir Keir Starmer.\n\nAccording to reports, the UK government has suggested that deploying British missiles is ultimately a decision for Ukraine, provided international law is respected.\n\nFollowing their meeting, both leaders shared updates on social media platform X.

Therefore, there are more and more voices in favor of achieving peace through diplomacy.\n\nThe power of diplomacy can indeed work, but the world must help Ukraine enter the negotiations in a strong position and pressure Russia to start them. This was stated by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an interview with the BBC.\n\nAfter more than two years of full-scale war, there are more and more calls for its end not on the battlefield but at the negotiating table. After the first Peace Summit in Switzerland in June of this year, Zelenskyy said that he believed it would be appropriate for Russia to participate in the second summit, which is scheduled to take place in November.\n\nSo Kyiv is not ruling out a diplomatic way to end the war, but, as the Ukrainian president noted, the whole world should put pressure on Russia to convince it to sit down at the table and consider ending the war.\n\n\"This does not mean that all territories are won by force. I think the power of diplomacy can help,\" the president emphasized.\n\nZelenskyy is also convinced that the weaker Russia is at the start of the negotiations, the stronger the position Ukraine will take.\n\n\"By putting pressure on Russia, I believe that it is possible to agree to a diplomatic settlement,\" the head of state said.\n\nAt the same time, he emphasized that Ukraine has not yet received the F-16 fighter jets promised by its partners, which it had hoped would arrive this summer.\n\n\"18 months have passed, and the planes have not reached us,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that Ukrainians are grateful to their allies for the assistance they have received.\n\nHowever, according to the president, Western fighters are very much needed by the Ukrainian army, which is holding back the occupiers on a long front line, under constant Russian attacks on peaceful cities and their attempts to advance, in particular in the Kharkiv region. And F-16s would help overcome Russian air dominance and \"unlock the sky.\"\n\nEarlier, Zelenskyy spoke about cooperation with Trump if he wins the US election. He believes that working with this president's administration will be \"difficult,\" but Ukrainians are \"hardworking people.\"\n\nIt was also reported that the day before the Ukrainian president arrived on an official visit to Britain.\n\nThe program of the visit includes meetings with King Charles III and the newly appointed Prime Minister of the British government, Keir Starmer. Zelenskyy also held a series of important talks with foreign leaders, signed bilateral agreements with Slovenia and the Czech Republic, and met with representatives of British defense companies, after which he announced the prospects for joint arms production.", "source": {"uri": "eng.obozrevatel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Obozrevatel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_War_of_Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatian War of Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head of state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bilateralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i2.obozrevatel.com/news/2024/7/19/gettyimages-21609911351.jpg?size=2010x1050", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743623", "eventUri": "eng-9743623", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

People targeted on our streets. Military planes entering our air space. Ships patrolling our coastlines,\" he said, adding \"this is the moment for us all to do more.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a key guest at the summit, spoke soon after, praising European support for Ukraine, saying, \"Putin cannot sustain relationships with truly strong leaders. And this is our advantage.\"\n\nBut Zelenskyy warned, \"It remains an advantage only as long as we are united.\"\n\nZelenskyy, without mentioning Orban by name, called out the Hungarian leader's recent visit to Moscow.\n\n\"If someone in Europe tries to resolve issues behind others' backs, or even at the expense of someone else,\" Zelenskyy said, \"if someone wants to make some trips to the capital of war to talk and perhaps promise something against our common interests, or to the expense of Ukraine or other countries, then why should we consider such a person?\"\n\nHungary assumed the rotating presidency of the European Union on July 1, and on July 5, Orban traveled to Moscow, where he met with Putin on what he called a \"peace mission.\" Orban also visited Kyiv, where he met with Zelenskyy, and took trips to Beijing, and the United States, where he met with former U.S. president Donald Trump.\n\nOrban is also attending the summit in Britain. As he arrived, he told reporters he supported Ukraine, but added that he does not believe Ukraine can defeat Russia and the conflict cannot be resolved on the battlefield. He said he supports a cease-fire and negotiations to end the war.\n\nAhead of the meeting, on his official account on the X social media platform, Zelenskyy said while in Britain, he would hold a separate meeting with Starmer, and they would \"sign an intergovernmental agreement on support for the Ukrainian defense and industrial complex,\" as well as discuss future defense cooperation.\n\nZelenskyy said he also would meet with King Charles.\n\nNew NATO command for Ukraine\n\nAhead of the meeting, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday the alliance's new command for coordinating military aid and training for Ukraine's military -- to be located in Germany -- will be operational in September. The command will be led by a three-star general with a team of 700 personnel.\n\nNATO leaders agreed at a summit earlier this month to launch the effort, with the aim of better coordinating Ukraine aid efforts and making that assistance more predictable.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian troops retreated from Urozhaine, a village in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk, a military spokesperson said Thursday, though he did not clarify when the withdrawal happened.\n\n\"As the enemy destroyed almost everything in Urozhaine, the defense forces withdrew to other positions,\" said Nazar Voloshyn. \"A decision was made to preserve the lives and health of our servicemen who were maintaining defense there.\"\n\nRussia took control of Urozhaine shortly after the invasion started in 2022. Almost a year ago, Ukrainian troops recaptured it, but Russia's defense ministry claimed that its army regained control several days ago.\n\nUkraine's military on Thursday also said it intercepted 16 Russian aerial drones and two guided missiles that targeted Ukraine in overnight attacks.\n\nThe Ukrainian air force said the intercepts took place over the Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Poltava and Zaporizhzhia regions.\n\nSerhiy Lysak, the regional governor of Dnipropetrovsk, said on Telegram that the Russian attacks injured two people and damaged 14 residential buildings.\n\nThreats of aerial attacks prompted alarms in Kyiv, but Ukrainian air defenses shot down Russian drones before they reached the area, according to Serhiy Popko, head of the Kyiv city administration.\n\nRussia's defense ministry said Thursday it destroyed 33 Ukrainian aerial drones and 10 naval drones.\n\nThe Ukrainian naval drones were heading toward the Russia-occupied Crimean Peninsula, while the aerial drones were shot down over Crimea and the Russian city of Bryansk, the Russian ministry said.\n\nBryansk Governor Aleksandr Bogomaz reported on Telegram there were no casualties or damage in his area.\n\nVOA

Credit: Screenshot from the video BBC\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that global pressure on Russia is necessary to bring about negotiations to end the war, the BBC reports.\n\nIn a recent interview with BBC, Zelenskyy expressed his willingness to work with any US administration, including a potential Trump presidency, despite concerns about future US support for Ukraine.\n\n\"By putting pressure on Russia, I think it is possible to agree to a diplomatic settlement,\" Zelenskyy told the BBC. He emphasized that diplomacy could play a role in resolving the war, saying, \"It doesn't mean that all territories are won back by force. I think the power of diplomacy can help.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian president's comments come as his country faces ongoing challenges on the battlefield. The BBC reports that Ukrainian troops have recently withdrawn from the village of Krynky on the occupied eastern bank of the Dnipro river, and are struggling to hold back Russian forces along an extended front line in the east.\n\nRegarding potential negotiations, Zelenskyy indicated that Russia should attend a peace summit planned for November. He argued that a weakened Russia on the battlefield would strengthen Ukraine's position at the negotiating table.\n\nRegarding US support, Zelenskyy addressed concerns about working with Donald Trump if he were to be re-elected. \"Maybe he really doesn't understand what goes on in Ukraine, so we have to work with the United States,\" Zelenskyy said, adding, \"It will be hard work, but we are hard workers.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian president also discussed his country's military needs, particularly the delayed arrival of promised F-16 fighter jets.\n\n\"It's been 18 months and the planes have not reached us,\" he said.\n\nDuring his visit to the UK, Zelenskyy met with Prime Minister Keir Starmer and is set to address the UK cabinet, becoming the first foreign leader to do so since US President Bill Clinton in 1997. The BBC reports that a \u00a33.5bn ($4,5 bn) defence export finance deal is expected to be signed during the visit.", "source": {"uri": "euromaidanpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euromaidan Press"}, "authors": [{"uri": "maria_tril@euromaidanpress.com", "name": "Maria Tril", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_News_Ukrainian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC News Ukrainian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnieper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dnieper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://euromaidanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/\u0417\u043d\u0456\u043c\u043e\u043a-\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430-2024-07-19-103224-2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743623", "eventUri": "eng-9743623", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Based on a survey of over 550 small business owners, our recent 10,000 Small Businesses UK report, \"Generation Growth: The Small Business Manifesto,\" outlines key policies that our programme alumni believe will support future growth.**\n\nTOP OF THE NEWSLIST\n\nHISTORY IN DOWNING STREET, FARCE ON THE INTERNET: Keir Starmer departs for Chequers after overseeing the goosebumps moment of Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressing the U.K. Cabinet -- and what Labour see as a very good two days of diplomacy for the new PM. Unfortunately for that historic moment, it was all overshadowed by ... the internet breaking.\n\nZelenskyy at No. 10: As trailed by Downing Street overnight, the Ukrainian president popped up at the home of the PM this morning, where he addressed the Cabinet as part of a big show of solidarity with Kyiv from the new government. Here's the pic of a suit-clad Starmer shaking the hand of Zelenskyy, in his trademark olive army fatigues, outside the famous black door.\n\nBut outside Downing Street: All hell was breaking loose as a global IT outage caused chaos (more on that below).\n\nBefore addressing Cabinet ... Starmer and Zelenskyy sat for a one-on-one tete-a-tete lasting about 35 minutes, No. 10 said, before a wider bilateral meeting between the pair and key staff. Starmer told Zelenskyy he hopes to \"return to Ukraine at the earliest opportunity.\"\n\nAnd then: Zelenskyy joined the full government Cabinet, which gave him a long standing ovation. He sat between Starmer and Shadow Defense Secretary John Healey. \"This is a very, very important meeting for us and you're very welcome here,\" Starmer said.\n\nHistory -- made: \"This is a real piece of history,\" Starmer added at Cabinet. Which is true -- No. 10 has been saying that Zelenskyy is the first foreign leader to address Cabinet in person since Bill Clinton nearly 30 years ago. As friend of the newsletter David Frost pointed out, former German Chancellor Angela Merkel actually addressed a virtual Cabinet in 2021 before she stepped down -- but maybe Zoom doesn't count.\n\nAs for the substance: Zelenskyy's main ask of Starmer was for him to \"show your leadership\" -- by granting Ukraine Britain's full blessing to use Western-made weapons on targets within Russia. He stressed that \"if the restriction on Western weapons is lifted\" it would help Kyiv to strengthen its defense and secure its frontline positions.\n\nHitting inside Russia ... with Western weapons is something many of Ukraine's allies are squeamish about -- fearing the reaction it could provoke from Vladimir Putin. Toeing a middle line on the Today program this morning -- before he sat next to Zelenskyy later -- Healey said the U.K.'s provision of weapons to Ukraine \"does not preclude them hitting targets in Russia\".\n\nBut but but: Healey added that this must be done \"within the parameters and the bounds of international humanitarian law\" -- and that the U.K. government is \"having intense discussions\" on this issue. Unsurprisingly, he wasn't up for providing further details, such as the still rumbling question of whether Ukraine can actually use long-range British-made missiles to hit deep into Russian territory.\n\nFrom opposition to government: One person familiar with the Cabinet meeting said Zelenskyy's appearance was another vivid reminder to Labour ministers that after years in grueling opposition, they are now in the hot seats at the heart of power. This person said it was thrilling and humbling to be in the same space as the face of Ukraine's resistance to Putin.\n\nBut even still: It's hard to knock \"global internet chaos\" down the headlines. It's the tech trouble, rather than the money-shot of Starmer and Zelenskyy, that's leading the news bulletins.\n\nWhat we actually know: The entire world has been hit with a mass IT outage, causing travel chaos and hitting the email and internal systems of banks, healthcare services and many other places that use Microsoft software. Even upmarket bakery Gail's was affected -- sorry Lib Dems. You'll have probably already seen that Sky News was forced offline for hours earlier. The cyber-security firm Crowdstrike has said the problem was caused by an update to its antivirus software.\n\nIs this good? As it stands at 5 p.m. following a full day of broken internet, nothing appears to have been really fixed. Crowdstrike's CEO George Kurtz told NBC News earlier it \"could be some time\" before everything is back to normal -- while Microsoft is still advising people to turn their devices off and on again.\n\nWhich all begs the usual question ... of why the tech systems we rely on appear to be held together by bits of (virtual, I guess?) string prone to breaking at any moment. Asked if Keir Starmer is concerned that an error from a company no one has heard of had the capacity to break everything, the PM's deputy official spokesperson told journalists he is \"certainly aware of the disruption this is having on services.\"\n\nAssemble the officials! No. 10 also confirmed a COBR meeting of senior officials was quickly called this morning, and that ministers were being kept up to date. No. 10 said it wasn't aware of any impact on government systems -- though one Home Office official told Playbook PM the department had been having \"trouble\" with Teams all day.\n\nNeedless to say: Playbook PM hopes you've been able to actually read any of this.\n\nIN THE COMMONS\n\nNEW GOVERNMENT, NEW GAZA POSITION: David Lammy stood up in the Commons this morning and announced the government's first big shift in its policy on the war in Gaza since Labour took charge.\n\nUNRWA funds, restored: The foreign secretary -- flanked by ministers Anneliese Dodds, newbie Middle East Minister Hamish Falconer and Defense Minister Luke Pollard -- told MPs in a rare Friday statement that the U.K. would resume funding to UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees. Lammy said he'd received assurances about the agency's neutrality, after Britain suspended donations in January amid allegations from Israel that some staff were involved in the October 7 attacks.\n\nThe Lammy words: \"UNRWA has acted. Active partners like Japan, the European Union and Norway have also now acted. This government will act. I can confirm to the House that we are overturning the suspension of UNRWA funding,\" Lammy told an audience of (mostly) Labour MPs, who purred and roared with approval. He talked up the importance of a two-state solution and said the Palestinian people had \"been in purgatory for decades\".\n\nWhich is a shift because ... the previous Conservative government view things the same way, despite a U.N. review finding no evidence for Israel's claims being published back in ... April.\n\nNot so special: The move also draws a dividing line between the Labour government's policy and that of the U.S, which is now the only country not to have restarted donations. In opposition Starmer's party sought to closely mirror U.S. policy on the conflict. Will that continue to change in government?\n\nNow: Development Minister Dodds met with UNRWA Commissioner Philippe Lazzarini this afternoon to discuss how the return of funding will work, Playbook PM is told.\n\nNext targets: Firm pro-Palestine MPs in Labour and some in the opposition parties welcomed the move -- before moving on to call for Labour to go further and recognize Palestine as a state and end arms sales to Israel. Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran -- who is of half Palestinian descent -- said she was \"disappointed\" Lammy refused to pull the statehood lever, while Labour veteran Barry Gardiner and Green MP Ellie Chowns hit out at Lammy's refusal to countenance a blanket ban on arms exports. Labour will continue to face pressure on those issues despite setting down a clear marker that it isn't going to strictly follow the last government's Gaza policy.\n\nBut anyone who watched ... might have noticed the Commons was pretty sparse for Lammy's statement beyond the Labour benches, with only a smattering of Tories present, a Trump-sized handful of Lib Dem MPs and few others beyond the single Green. None of the independent MPs elected on a pro-Gaza ticket were there, and the same goes for the SNP's last nine MPs standing -- who all made a big play out of their pro-Gaza credentials during the election.\n\nA loser making the point: Deposed MP-turned Labour Together boss Jonathan Ashworth was tweeting about Shockat Adam, who defeated him in Leicester South then declared the victory was for Gaza, not making it along to the statement. Ashworth was one of many Labour bods bruised by the party's positioning on Gaza when polling day came around.\n\nBut to be fair: The statement was announced Friday morning (Playbook AM got wind of it late Thursday) on a day when most MPs not planning to speak in the king's speech debate would have already been back in their constituencies. An SNP official told Playbook PM the statement was \"sprung upon MPs\" and that parliament was initially due to be debating only English and Wales matters -- and that's why SNP MPs traveled northward on Thursday as normal and weren't in the chamber.\n\nAs for the Tories: A handful of eyebrows were raised as Alicia Kearns, the former chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee who was only just elevated to the front bench, responded to the statement for the Tory opposition in the absence of Lammy's shadow Andrew Mitchell. Kearns has long been more critical of Israel compared to many of her Tory colleagues -- and she did not criticize the return of funding to UNRWA, instead asking only for a timeline of when funds will return as she struck a mainly constructive tone.\n\nHolden me back: Therefore it fell to the former Tory Chair Richard Holden to push back. \"I am concerned by the government's decision to resume funding to UNRWA. UNRWA schools have been repeatedly used by terrorists both to store weapons and to launch attacks, and over 100 UNRWA staff have had links to terrorist groups in the region,\" he said, citing those allegations that the U.N. said Israel has yet to prove. Holden was one of just two Tory MPs to speak up alongside Kearns, and was the only MP to speak in opposition to returning donations.\n\nIt's an obvious point, but ... this is clearly a very different parliament to the one before the election -- and that includes parliament's overall position on the war in Gaza. The Labour government will have to navigate a significantly more pro-Palestine parliament -- including a number of independents elected on a pro-Gaza ticket -- than the Conservatives ever did. And ministers will no doubt be aware that plenty of former Labour voters who didn't back the party on July 4 are watching closely.\n\nDRIVETIME DEBRIEF\n\nFULL SHADOW TEAM REVEALED: In case you were confused by Alicia Kearns' appearance on the Tory front bench earlier ... the Conservatives have now released confirmation of further appointments to their (interim) front bench, including Kearns to the shadow FCDO team. Read them all here via the Indy's John Rentoul.\n\nJUST ANNOUNCED: David Lammy will visit India next week, before flying on to attend the ASEAN summit in Laos.\n\nARRESTS IN LEEDS: Those scenes of chaos in Harehills, Leeds, that gripped Twitter last night have resulted in a number of arrests, West Yorkshire Police said today -- though they weren't up for specifying how many. The upheaval -- which police confirmed began after social workers were called to an address -- was condemned by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and by Keir Starmer's spokesperson earlier.\n\nFOREVER INDEBTED: Public sector net debt reached 99.5 percent of GDP in June, 2.8 percentage points higher than in June 2023 and the highest since 1962 according to ONS figures. Borrowing fell by \u00a33.2 billion to \u00a314.5 billion. More details from the Beeb here.\n\nBENEFITS OF HINDSIGHT: Former Post Office Minister Jo Swinson admitted she wished she'd \"asked more questions or intervened more\" during her time in the role between 2012 and 2015. The ex-Lib Dem leader was being grilled this morning by the Post Office inquiry, and added that former Post Office CEO Paula Vennells told her some sub-postmasters \"had their fingers in the till.\"\n\nJUST IN: The i's Kitty Donaldson, Hugo Gye and Richard Vaughan reported just before Playbook PM went to inboxes that Tories and some in Reform now expect Suella Braverman to defect to Reform U.K. A spokesperson for Braverman told the i this isn't true.\n\nHORRIBLE NEWS: One person died overnight after a boat carrying asylum seekers across the Channel ran into \"difficulty,\" French authorities said. It is thought that 86 people were on board. The numbers arriving on small boats in 2024 meanwhile passed 15,000, more than 1,000 higher than the same time in 2023. Sky has more information.\n\nBIT THORNY: Emily Thornberry ain't at all pleased at being snubbed for a Cabinet role.

Napoleon Bonaparte. They found that in a straight fantasy contest between Macron and the former emperor, Napoleon would romp home with 62 percent to Macron's 38 percent.

The survey of more than 550 alumni finds that these companies are, overall, optimistic about doing business in the UK and have embraced advanced technology like generative artificial intelligence surprisingly quickly. But these business owners also see areas where government support is greatly needed to help them be more efficient. Increasing productivity for small and medium-size enterprises, improving access to financing, as well as support in areas like climate, regulation and AI could have an impact that could boost the entire UK economy.

the first to address a full cabinet since US President Bill Clinton in 1997.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy will visit Number 10 on Friday as the UK government promises to lead a \"crackdown\" on Russian oil vessels.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader, who has been in the country for the European Political Community (EPC) summit, will meet the whole of the new cabinet in Downing Street to brief them on the ongoing war and \"the need to ramp up Europe's defence industrial base to outpace the Russian threat\".\n\nIt will be the first time Sir Keir Starmer has hosted a foreign leader since becoming prime minister, as well as the first time a president has addressed the cabinet in person since former US president Bill Clinton in 1997.\n\nPolitics live: Reaction to summit at Blenheim Palace\n\nThe meeting comes after 44 European countries and the European Union agreed at the EPC summit to work together to disrupt Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\".\n\nIt is a group of around 6,000 vessels that carry 1.7 million barrels of oil a day, which the government says the country uses to \"generate significant funds to fuel its war machine\", with some thought to act as listening stations or to transport weapons.\n\nThe UK and Ukrainian defence ministers are also expected to sign a new defence export support treaty, worth \u00a33.5bn and agreed by the two leaders, to increase military hardware and weapons production for the war effort.\n\nPresident Zelenskyy also met representatives of the UK defence industry and UK Defence Secretary John Healey on Wednesday to discuss how to deepen cooperation and boost defence industrial production.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the meeting, Sir Keir said: \"Ukraine is, and always will be, at the heart of this government's agenda and so it is only fitting that President Zelenskyy will make a historic address to my cabinet.\n\n\"Russia's incremental gains on the battlefield are nothing compared with the collective international support for Ukraine, or the strength of ties between our people.\n\n\"And alongside our European partners, we have sent a clear message to those enabling Putin's attempts to evade sanctions - we will not allow Russia's shadow fleet, and the dirty money it generates, to flow freely through European waters and put our security at risk.\"\n\nRead more from Sky News:\n\nTwo men deny murder after remains

The agreement involves a loan worth two \u00a3billion pounds to finance Ukraine's defense needs.\n\nThe deal confirms the UK's financial support for strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities, including the purchase of modern weapons, military equipment, and other defense equipment in accordance with NATO standards.\n\n\"We have to remember that in many aspects, Russia is weaker. Their intelligence is weaker. Their diplomacy has turned into mere bribes, lies, or threats. Economically, they are not strong.\n\nThe only competitive advantage Putin still has is a large supply of Soviet-era weapons, money, and a complete disregard for human life. Quite a dangerous mix.

He has not said how he'd do so. At his debate against President Joe Biden in June, Trump criticized the large amount of military aid going to Ukraine, but also said Russian President Vladimir Putin's terms to end the war are \"not acceptable.\"\n\nAs for Ukraine's president, Trump said, \"Every time Zelenskyy comes to this country, he walks away with $60 billion. The greatest salesman ever.\"\n\nThe selection of JD Vance as Trump's running mate has also raised concerns in Kyiv, given his longtime criticism of U.S. aid to Ukraine. In the leadup to the Russian invasion in 2022, Vance said on a podcast: \"I don't really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.\"\n\nRussian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov praised Trump's choice of Vance earlier this week, saying, \"He's in favor of peace, in favor of ending the assistance that's been provided and we can only welcome that. that's what we need -- to stop pumping Ukraine full of weapons. Then the war will end.\"\n\nZelenskyy, who quickly condemned Saturday's assassination attempt on Trump on social media, told reporters on Monday he'd work with whoever is elected president in November.\n\n\"If Mr. Donald Trump becomes president, then we will work with him. I am not afraid of it,\" Zelenskyy said at a press conference in Kyiv, according to Politico.\n\nZelenskyy said earlier this month that he didn't know Trump very well, but he'd \"had meetings with him, and we had we had good meetings when he was the president.\"\n\nTheir first interaction, however, led to Trump's first impeachment by the then-Democratically controlled House of Representatives. Trump was impeached on charges he abused his power by pressuring Zelenskyy to announce investigations into then-presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son while withholding almost $400 million in aid, and that he had obstructed Congress by refusing to release any documents related to his actions.\n\nTrump denied any wrongdoing and maintained the call was \"perfect.\" He was acquitted at his trial before the Senate.\n\nBiden has been a staunch ally of Ukraine, sending the country hundreds of billions of dollars in aid. He met with Zelenskyy last week at the NATO summit in Washington, D.C., and mistakenly introduced him to the crowd as \"President Putin.\"\n\nTrump said Biden's gaffe was \"not good.

The Ukraine defence loan will run for 15 years, with the possibility of an extension, and has been provided at a \"favourable\" interest rate, the Ukrainian MoD stated.\n\n\"According to the framework agreement, the loan will be utilised for implementing large-scale initiatives aimed at enhancing Ukraine's defence capabilities. This will reduce the burden on the state budget and allow in the short term to obtain the necessary weapons for the defence of our state, first of all, in the field of air defence,\" said Umerov.\n\nOf particular note was the formation of a \"joint panel\", comprising officials of both governments, that would \"oversee the targetted use of the loan\", the statement continued.\n\nThe focus on air defence is also key, with Zelenskyy regularly calling for additional air defence capabilities, such as the Patriot system, to protect critical national infrastructure.\n\nCoinciding with the signing of the defence loan agreement, Zelenskyy addressed the UK Government cabinet meeting, where he called on the UK to \"show its leadership\" in convincing \"other partners\" to remove operational limitations on long-range strike weapons already provided.\n\nThe UK, France, and the US have all sent long-range strike munitions to Ukraine with the Storm Shadow/SCALP and ATACMS missiles respectively.\n\nHowever, the US has stated publicly that at present it does not allow Ukraine to strike at military targets inside Russian territory, with Washington concerned over escalation risks.\n\nIndeed, it was only after France and UK first approved the provision of Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missiles that Washington relented to permit ATACMS to be sent to Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking on 12 July, a US DoD spokesperson said that the Pentagon was \"always mindful of escalation\", which appears to be the primary reason for the current ban on long-rang strikes by Ukraine inside Russia using ATACMS.\n\nBizarrely, in a press briefing on 18 July, a US Department of Defense spokesperson stated that Ukrainian forces continued to \"dig in and push the Russians back\" in the battlefield of eastern Ukraine, responding to media queries on US commitment to Kyiv.\n\nIt is an accepted reality that Russia has in fact been forcing Ukraine back on a number of fronts in its 2024 summer offensive, made partly possible through the intransigence of US lawmakers in delaying a 2023 multi-billion-dollar military assistance package due to political infighting, starving Ukraine of critical equipment and ammunition.", "source": {"uri": "army-technology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Army Technology"}, "authors": [{"uri": "richard_thomas@army-technology.com",

{"id": 232039122, "title": "Michael Mosley: TV presenter found dead on Greek island, wife confirms", "text": "The wife of the British TV presenter Michael Mosley has confirmed the \u201cdevastating\u201d news that her husband has been found dead on the Greek island of Symi. Dr Clare Bailey said she and the couple\u2019s four children took comfort in the fact that he \u201chad almost made it\u201d, after his body was found close to a coastal resort on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re taking comfort in the fact that he so very nearly made it. He did an incredible climb, took the wrong route and collapsed where he couldn\u2019t be easily seen by the extensive search team.\u201d Mosley, 67, went missing after going for a walk on the island on Wednesday, sparking an intensive five-day search. Confirming that he had been found, Bailey said she did not \u201cknow quite where to begin\u201d. In a statement she said: \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to have lost Michael, my wonderful, funny, kind and brilliant husband. We had an incredibly lucky life together. We loved each other very much and were so happy together.\u201d Bailey, who met Mosley at medical school, said she was \u201cincredibly proud\u201d of the couple\u2019s children and of their resilience and support. \u201cMy family and I have been hugely comforted by the outpouring of love from people from around the world. It\u2019s clear that Michael meant a huge amount to so many of you,\u201d she said. She added that Mosley \u2013 who repeatedly tested scientific theories on his own body \u2013 was an adventurous man, which was \u201cpart of what made him so special\u201d. She added: \u201cWe are so grateful to the extraordinary people on Symi who have worked tirelessly to help find him. Some of these people on the island, who hadn\u2019t even heard of Michael, worked from dawn till dusk unasked. We\u2019re also very grateful to the press who have dealt with us with great respect. \u201cI feel so lucky to have our children and my amazing friends. Most of all, I feel so lucky to have had this life with Michael.\u201d On the fifth day of what had become an increasingly frantic hunt, Mosley was reportedly discovered by a camera operator working with the state broadcaster ERT. His body was discovered on rocky terrain close to a fence, next to a small resort which is accessible only by boat or by foot. The resort is on the opposite side of the bay from where he had left his wife and friends and around 30 minutes\u2019 walk from Pedi, where he was last seen. Extreme weather warnings have been in place this week in Symi, where temperatures have reached above 40C (104F) in the afternoon. \u201cIt is clear from his watch and clothes that it is Dr Mosley,\u201d a police spokesperson, Konstantina Dimoglou, said. It was unclear how long he had been dead, Dimoglou said. A police source told BBC News the deceased had been dead \u201cfor a number of days\u201d. A news camera crew said they had spotted the body from a boat in the bay of Ayia Marina, having zoomed in on an image they had captured. \u201cWe located him [from a boat] when we went into the bay of Ayia Marina,\u201d said the ERT journalist Aristides Miaoulis, who described how when the team\u2019s camera operator looked back at his footage he noticed \u201csomething strange\u201d. \u201cLooking back at the material he had got, he saw something strange near a fence, about 50 metres from the sea, and then we could see, once we zoomed in, that it was this man because his watch was glinting [in the sun].\u201d The island\u2019s mayor, who was with the media team, said previously 200 people had searched the site and yet, Mosley had not been found. The Hellenic coastguard was immediately called to the area, and it was taped off. The discovery was made on the day search teams had turned their focus to a set of caves belonging to a rocky outcrop close to Ayia Marina beach. Images, which had been intentionally blurred, showed the remains were found on rocky land by a chain link fence close to the beach resort. The father of four is thought to have been walking from St Nikolas beach to the port of Symi Town where he was staying in a house with friends, a walk of a little over 2 miles. At around 2pm local time (12pm BST) on Sunday, firefighters arrived at the marina by boat and carried an orange stretcher and large black bag to where the body was found; others in plain clothes and carrying briefcases went up the rocky hill, PA Media reported. Five firefighters left the island by boat with the body on a stretcher at around 2.45pm local time. On Saturday, an emergency services helicopter spent hours flying across the mountainous search site on Symi between Pedi bay and Ayia Marina. The discovery of the body came amid a massive air, land and sea operation to find the TV presenter and health guru, who popularised intermittent fasting and designed the 5:2 diet. Mosley set off hiking from St Nikolas beach at 1.30pm local time on Wednesday, bound for the port town of Symi when he vanished outside the seaside village of Pedi. CCTV images of Mosley taken about 20 minutes after he was last seen showed him shielding himself against the fierce sun under an umbrella. His wife raised the alarm at 7.30pm after he failed to return to the house where the couple were staying with British friends who live part of the year on the island and where Mosley had left his mobile phone. A search and rescue operation was launched to locate Mosley, who is best known for his appearances on The One Show and This Morning. Bailey was later joined by the couple\u2019s adult children on the island. The search included police, firefighters, coastguard officials, drones, helicopters, divers and a specially trained sniffer dog brought in from Athens. It was one of the biggest operations of its kind in living memory. Initially, investigators had focused the search on the clifftop path Mosley had taken from the beach as he headed towards Pedi. Mosley, a columnist for the Daily Mail, made a number of documentaries about diet and exercise, including the Channel 4 show Michael Mosley: Who Made Britain Fat? He was also part of the BBC series Trust Me, I\u2019m a Doctor. He lived with tapeworms in his gut for six weeks for the documentary Infested! Living With Parasites on BBC Four. Mosley was also credited for the rising popularity of the 5:2 diet, which involves fasting for two days a week to lose weight. He was named medical journalist of the year by the British Medical Association in 1995.", "summary": "<p>Dr Clare Bailey says her husband \u2018almost made it\u2019 after his body was found close to a coastal resort in Symi</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/jun/09/michael-mosley-tributes\">\u2018He was a hero to me\u2019: Michael Mosley\u2019s friends and peers pay tribute</a></li></ul><p></p><p>The wife of the British TV presenter Michael Mosley has confirmed the \u201cdevastating\u201d news that her husband has been found dead on the Greek island of Symi.</p><p>Dr Clare Bailey said she and the couple\u2019s four children took comfort in the fact that he \u201chad almost made it\u201d, after his body was found close to a coastal resort on Sunday.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/jun/09/body-of-man-believed-to-be-tv-doctor-michael-mosley-found-on-greek-island-authorities-say\">Continue reading...</a>", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/jun/09/body-of-man-believed-to-be-tv-doctor-michael-mosley-found-on-greek-island-authorities-say", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d6878a6cc21a6f5dc8a5c55c890c94be36af66a/262_225_2526_1514/master/2526.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZ", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:56:22", "author": "Alexandra Topping,Helena Smith", "authors": ["Alexandra Topping", "Helena Smith"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.069}

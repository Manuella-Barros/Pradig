Will and Carlton start their summer with summer jobs but face unexpected challenges. The upcoming season explores themes such as partnership differences, family pressures, and romantic hurdles for the characters.\n\nSchool may be out for the cast of Bel-Air, but that doesn't mean their struggles as a family unit are over in the upcoming third season, which just got its first trailer. The dramatic reimagining of the beloved sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Bel-Air Season 3 will have Will (Jabari Banks) and the rest of the Banks family continue to deal with a variety of serious topics. Other big developments for the upcoming season of Bel-Air include the return of Will's infamous father Lou (Marlon Wayans) and a surprise-yet-welcome appearance of Joseph Marcell, who played Geoffrey in the original Fresh Prince of Bel-Air series.\n\nThe for Bel-Air Season 3 begins with Will and the Banks family planning for their summer vacation, but none of them really have any idea of what's in store. Things seem pretty low-key to start with, as Will and Carlton (Olly Sholotan) get summer jobs at the local country club. However, things take an immediate left turn for Will and the rest of his family as soon as his father Lou enters the picture. The official plot synopsis for Bel-Air Season 3 reads as follows:\n\nIn season three, school's out for the summer, and Will is doing Bel-Air his way. Being a part of the Banks family has given him a new perspective - it isn't just about wealth, it means that Will now has options to lean into other things that excite him and has the privilege to dream bigger. As Will makes an exciting pivot, he finds a partner in Carlton, who desperately wants to leave his life of addiction behind and rebuild his damaged reputation. And while the dynamic duo has a lot of exciting wins, working together also reveals fundamental differences in their backgrounds and worldviews. Can a partnership of such extremes work? Pressure at work and home will also pose challenges for Viv and Phil. How does a couple hold strong when their lives are at sea? Hilary's romantic journey with LaMarcus will face some shocking hurdles, and Ashley's views on romance will start to blossom as she comes of age the summer before she starts high school, and Geoffrey's London past will come a little too close to home.\n\nWho Stars in 'Bel-Air' Season 3?\n\nClose\n\nMost of the series regulars from the past two seasons of Bel-Air will be returning for Season 3. Jabari Banks (American Dream: The 21 Savage Story) as Will Smith, Adrian Holmes (Star Trek: Strange New Worlds) as Philip Banks, Cassandra Freeman (Luke Cage) as Vivian Banks, Olly Sholotan (Cruel Summer) as Carlton Banks, Coco Jones (Vampires vs. the Bronx) as Hilary Banks, Akira Akbar (Captain Marvel) as Ashley Banks, Jimmy Akingbola (In the Long Run) as Geoffrey Thompson, Jordan L. Jones (All Rise), and Simone Joy Jones (Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead). Additionally, fans of the show can also expect to see Air star Marlon Wayans as Will's father, Lou, as well as original Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star Joseph Marcell in a special mystery role.\n\nBel-Air Season 3 will debut exclusively on Peacock with a three-episode premiere on Thursday, August 15th, 2024.

On Friday, Peacock released the official trailer for Bel-Air Season 3, which revealed Marcell as part of the cast of the new installment.\n\nThe trailer, which you can watch below, sees Marcell enter at around the 1:30 mark. He's obviously not reprising his role as Geoffrey, as that character is played by Jimmy Akingbola in this series, but details regarding his mystery character are scarce. All that's known at this point is that Marcell will be appearing as a \"mysterious member of the Banks family' past.\"\n\nBel-Air returns to Peacock for Season 3 on August 15th.

Just like Tatyana Ali's guest appearance as Mrs. Hughes in Season 2, Marcell will make his \"Bel-Air\" debut as a yet-to-be-named \"mysterious member of the Banks' family's past.\"\n\nBanks-Waddles said they knew they wanted an original \"Fresh Prince\" star to join the cast this season, but nailing down how and when was the toughest battle due to the Marcell's distance and hefty schedule.\n\n\"We had a couple of ideas, but we weren't sure on availability and storyline, and he's the one that made sense. It was even tough for him because he doesn't live here; he lives in London,\" Banks-Waddles told TheWrap. \"He's very much a working actor, does plays, was in the middle of a play, so just getting getting him here to L.A. for the availability was a feat. We weren't even sure that was going to work out. So we had a couple of ideas for ways to get some O.G. cast in, and he was at the top of that list.\"\n\nThough Banks-Waddles said the show doesn't want to flood \"Bel-Air\" with \"Fresh Prince\" cameos, she acknowledged that it's nostalgic for viewers.\n\n\"We try not to overdo it, but get excited when when it happens. So yeah, look for him this season. In a very key role, someone from the past of the Banks family.\" Banks-Waddles explained. \"I'm just thankful and grateful that we had the support of the studio and the network to just get him here. It was exciting. Everybody on set [wanted] pictures, to meet him. He was just just a lovely man.\"\n\n\"Bel-Air\" Season 3 will premiere with three episodes on Aug. 15. Here's Peacock's synopsis of \"Bel-Air\" Season 3.\n\n\"School's out for the summer, and Will is doing Bel-Air his way. Being a part of the Banks family has given him a new perspective - it isn't just about wealth, it means that Will now has options to lean into other things that excite him and has the privilege to dream bigger. As Will makes an exciting pivot, he finds a partner in Carlton, who desperately wants to leave his life of addiction behind and rebuild his damaged reputation. And while the dynamic duo has a lot of exciting wins, working together also reveals fundamental differences in their backgrounds and worldviews.\"\n\nThe full cast set to return for Season 3 includes Jabari Banks, Olly Sholotan, Coco Jones, Akira Akbar, Adrian Holmes, Cassandra Freeman, Jimmy Akingbola, Jordan L.

His yet-to-be-named character forewarns, \"There's always going to be a price, and that's on you.\"\n\nIt's summertime in Bel-Air, and the rest of the trailer sees Will (Jabari Banks) working at his uncle Phil's (Adrian Holmes) country club and clashing with his father, Lou (Marlon Wayans).

Original star Smith executive produces alongside the original creative team: Andy and Susan Borowitz, Benny Medina, and Quincy Jones.\n\nMarcell's casting comes after original star Tatyana Ali, who played Ashley Banks on the sitcom, guest starred in season 2 as Ms. Hughes, a teacher to this iteration's Ashley (Akira Akbar).\n\nShowrunner Carla Banks-Waddles told TheWrap getting Marcell was a \"feat\" given the actor's schedule and location (Marcell lives in London). \"We weren't even sure that was going to work out,\" Banks-Waddles said. \"We had a couple of ideas for ways to get some O.G. cast in, and he was at the top of that list.\"\n\nThough the show tries not \"to overdo it\" with cameos, Banks-Waddles was very much for the nostalgic surprise. \"We try not to overdo it but get excited when it happens,\" she explained. \"I'm just thankful and grateful that we had the support of the studio and the network to just get him here.

A new trailer for season 3 of the hit Peacock series based on the iconic Will Smith-led comedy sitcom is here, and it looks like we are in for a hot, drama-filled summer.\n\nWill (Jabari Banks) and the Banks family are enjoying summer in the third season of the show, and at one point, they claim they didn't want it to happen.\n\nWhile the trailer shows plenty of fun in Bel-Air, there has to be some drama involved. Carlton (Olly Sholoton) and Will still have an interesting relationship/friendship but also have to get summer gigs, so Uncle Phil (Adrian Holmes) suggests they work at the country club.\n\nThe idea of having a summer job doesn't sit well with Will and especially Carlton because he's an entitled brat, but they don't have a choice in the matter.\n\nBut the new job is a blessing in disguise for both of them because they both discover summer love. As we see in the trailer, both Will and Carlton are also dealing with demons, whether it's Will trying to make his basketball team and dealing with his deadbeat dad or Carlton still trying to kick his drug habit.\n\nHillary (Coco Jones) and Jazz (Jordan L. Jones) have seemingly moved on but still have the hots for each other. Uncle Phil and Aunt Viv's (Cassandra Freeman) marriage is still experiencing issues as Ashley (Akira Akbar) is still going through growing pains as a young teenager, coming to terms with her sexuality and being a young activist.\n\nFormer house manager/Uncle Phil's fixer Geoffrey (Jimmy Akingbola) is still as mysterious as ever.\n\nA description from Peacock about the third season reads:\n\nSeason 3 explores questions like, how do you prove yourself in a world that views you in limited ways? How do you reach beyond your comfort zone to create new opportunities for yourself? How does a family rebuild broken trust?\n\nBel-Air season 3 will continue the trend of cast members from the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air appearing in the Peacock series.\n\nLast season, Tatyana Ali joined the cast. This season, we will see the original Geoffrey, Joseph Marcell, join the cast in a role still yet to be revealed.\n\nWho knows? When we spoke with both actors back in March 2022, they suggested that Garcell might play Akingbola's Geoffrey's uncle in the series.\n\nVic Mensa and Dul\u00e9 Hill also join the cast in season 3", "source": {"uri": "cassiuslife.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cassius | born unapologetic | News, Style, Culture"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bel-Air_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bel-Air (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banks_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banks (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Holmes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Akingbola", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Akingbola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Marcell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Marcell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dul\u00e9_Hill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dul\u00e9 Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatyana_Ali", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tatyana Ali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talent manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vic_Mensa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vic Mensa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air_Quality", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air Quality", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cassiuslife.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/47/2024/07/17214110251658.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=560&crop=0,0,100,320px", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747608", "eventUri": "eng-9747608", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Will Smith (Jabari Banks) and Carlton Banks (Olly Sholotan) are encouraged to get jobs...\n\n...Hilary Banks (Coco Jones) struggles between old and new loves, while also trying to balance life as an influencer...\n\n...Philip Banks (Adrian Holmes) and Vivian Banks (Cassandra Freeman) are still as beautiful as ever, but there seem to be outside sources looking to interrupt their happy home...\n\n...and Ashley Banks (Akira Akbar) is still on a mission to spread peace, both in and outside her family, while also on her own journey of self-discovery.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bel-Air_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bel-Air (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlton_Banks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlton Banks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fresh_Prince_of_Bel-Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coco Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Holmes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Hunger_Relief", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Hunger Relief", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bQIjS4ADWt0E1laULuv3sQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTc7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/buzzfeed_articles_778/00df9e0a22b68f3909f1e8d8ab0537ae", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747608", "eventUri": "eng-9747608", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

The show is set in the summer and with that, you're going to see characters try to figure out new ways to find success. Will, for example, is still trying to find a way to continue to pursue his dreams while also working at a country club. Carlton, meanwhile, is trying to recover after all his struggles with addiction.\n\nIf you head over to the link here, you can see the trailer that teases family issues, new romances, and Geoffrey's story starting to ignite in some new ways.\n\nIf this is not enough for you for whatever reason, we suggest checking out the full logline:\n\nIn season three, school's out for the summer, and Will is doing Bel-Air his way. Being a part of the Banks family has given him a new perspective - it isn't just about wealth, it means that Will now has options to lean into other things that excite him and has the privilege to dream bigger. As Will makes an exciting pivot, he finds a partner in Carlton, who desperately wants to leave his life of addiction behind and rebuild his damaged reputation. And while the dynamic duo has a lot of exciting wins, working together also reveals fundamental differences in their backgrounds and worldviews. Can a partnership of such extremes work? Pressure at work and home will also pose challenges for Viv and Phil. How does a couple hold strong when their lives are at sea? Hilary's romantic journey with LaMarcus will face some shocking hurdles, and Ashley's views on romance will start to blossom as she comes of age the summer before she starts high school, and Geoffrey's London past will come a little too close to home.\n\nBe sure to share right now in the attached comments!

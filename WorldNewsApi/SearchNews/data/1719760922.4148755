Merchan chastised Merchan vehemently, telling the Trump attorney, \"That was outrageous, Mr. Blanche\u2026. Someone who's been an attorney as long as you have knows that is highly inappropriate.\" The following day \u2014 with jury deliberations only hours away \u2014 former federal prosecutor and ex-FBI general counsel Andrew Weissmann appeared on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" and emphasized that Merchan was right to admonish Blanche.

So, he's like, don't think about it, but essentially saying: to the extent that that is now in your head, you need to remember there may be no jail here because it's not required.

Q: Describe the challenge of now going against Saquon Barkley twice a year? A: It\u2019s going to be very challenging. I saw it on the practice field every day. He\u2019s a very good route-runner, he\u2019s a very patient runner, he\u2019s physical, he\u2019s a big back, strong legs. He\u2019s a pretty total package back, so it\u2019ll be a great challenge for us. Q: Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said he told a heckling Giants fan, \u201cWe got your best player.\u201d A: I still see Dexter [Lawrence] and A.T. [Andrew Thomas] on the field, so I think we\u2019re good (laugh). Q: Devin Singletary is Saquon\u2019s replacement. A: Very veteran presence. He\u2019s a pro\u2019s pro. He knows how to practice hard. He\u2019s a good running back, physical, patient, good vision. He\u2019s gonna be a great addition for us. Q: What\u2019s it like standing behind Sexy Dexy on gameday? A: It\u2019s great. It makes my job A lot easier. He takes up two, three blocks at a time, and allows me to just go run and hit. Q: I know you were upset when Wink Martindale left. Describe new defensive coordinator Shane Bowen. A: Yeah, Wink was my guy, I loved him. But Shane is an incredible defensive coordinator. He\u2019s very smart, he has a very bright football mind, and I\u2019m glad he\u2019s my defensive coordinator. Q: What changes as far as defensive philosophy? A: I think we\u2019re going to have a lot more rules, a lot more process of decision-making that\u2019s going to allow us to play fast. Q: What can Brian Burns mean for this defense? A: He could be a game-changer. He\u2019s an electric athlete, fast, physical, silky when he pass rushes. He can take over games. Q: How would you describe Kayvon\u2019s Thibodeaux\u2019s style? A: Kayvon\u2019s dominant, Kayvon\u2019s physically dominant. He\u2019s strong as an ox, and he\u2019s very technically sound. Q: Sounds like it\u2019s going to be \u2026 A: Thunder and Lightning (laugh). Q: What is Dex? A: Dex is \u201cThe Hammer\u201d (laugh). Q: What do you think the on-field personality of this defense can be or will be? A: Imposing. Imposing of our will. Imposing of our physical dominance. Yeah we\u2019re just going to take over. Q: Can this be a top-five defense? A: Easily. Q: Thoughts on first-round draft pick Malik Nabers? A: I love him. He has elite body control. Great ball-tracking skills. He\u2019s a guy who\u2019s made for the bright lights. Q: How much better can Nabers make Daniel Jones? A: They talk about a thing called youthful exuberance, and I think that\u2019s what Nabers has. He has energy, he has confidence, I think that\u2019s going to inspire Daniel and everybody on offense. Q: What is your level of confidence in Jones? A: Very high. Q: You weren\u2019t here when he won a playoff game. A: I\u2019ve seen the competitor he is for about a year-and-a-half now. Obviously I played him [with the Colts] in 2022. \u2026 Me and Daniel had our couple collisions, obviously I got to see the competitor he is. But getting to know him, he\u2019s a great guy. He\u2019s a very down-to-earth guy, he\u2019s close with the offensive guys, and he\u2019s a good leader. Q: What do you remember about those collisions you had with him? A: I got flagged for a personal foul on one of them. I almost took off his head. And the other one he scored a touchdown, so it was good back and forth. Q: Describe your linebacking partner Micah McFadden. A: I love him. I think he\u2019s blossoming into a very talented player in this league. Q: Tyler Nubin? A: He\u2019s got great energy and great poise. He communicates a lot which is very important for us at the back end, and I think he\u2019s going to help us a lot this year. Q: Deonte Banks? A: He could be one of the best corners in this league. He\u2019s got all the physical tools, he\u2019s got the mentality, and I\u2019m just excited for him to keep growing. Q: Are you made for the bright lights? A: I am. Q: Why do you say that? A: They call me \u201cBroadway Bobby\u201d (laugh). Q: I saw clips of you singing and performing in \u201cChicago The Musical.\u201d A: That was fun. I sang choir in high school, we did some musical theater stuff, so it\u2019s not new to me. Q: Do you get into Manhattan a lot? A: Maybe once a week. I try to stay out of there. \u2026 It\u2019s a little too fun (laugh). Q: Any favorite New York City things? A: Central Park is a very beautiful place. It\u2019s calming. Soho House is very nice. Lagos the restaurant has good food. And then Broadway shows. Q: It\u2019s the New York Giants\u2019 100th anniversary season. A: It\u2019s a very important year, for our organization, for our front office, for our owners \u2026 an organization to just remind people the pride of the New York Giants. Q: Thoughts on the Century Red uniforms? A: I like them. It\u2019s a throwback to the original New York Giants. Paying homage to the guys who have paved the way. Q: What did you know about New York Giants tradition before you came here? A: Obviously won Super Bowls here. Had a lot of pride. And just had a lot of great players. You see guys like Osi Umenyiora, Justin Tuck, Eli Manning, all those guys come back. It\u2019s a very historic or prestigious organization. Q: What does it mean for you to be a captain, and does anything change with Saquon, Xavier McKinney, and Adoree\u2019 Jackson and Leonard Williams gone? A: It means a lot to be Captain, because my teammates trust me. It means my teammates see how hard I\u2019m working, and see how much I care about them. And yeah, with that void of leadership, obviously Saquon is an incredible leader. X. has been here for a while, was a very good leader. Adoree\u2019, Leonard like we talked about. \u2026 Yeah, it\u2019s an opportunity for me to step up, be more vocal, just be myself. I\u2019ve had success in this league, I know what it takes, I\u2019ve been around great leaders and great players, so just trying to impart that wisdom on the young guys. Q: You had 149 tackles last season. What can you do for an encore? A: 150 (laugh). Q: That\u2019s realistic. A: For sure. I had [151] the other year. Yeah, just trying to set personal records. Q: You didn\u2019t miss a snap last season. How do you explain your durability? A: Discipline. I had a very disciplined routine, from my sleep to nutrition to recovery. I was always in the training room stretching, trying to do prehab as opposed to rehab, just staying on top of it \u2026 controlling everything I can. Q: Did it tick you off not making the Pro Bowl? A: A little bit. There were definitely great players who earned it. So now I got to just do better and leave no doubt. Q: Describe your on-field mentality. A: Dogmatic. Mentally, physically, emotionally dominant. Q: What are you like standing in the tunnel before running out on the field? A: I\u2019m feeling all the emotions. I\u2019m feeling energy, passion, excitement, love for the game. \u2026 I\u2019m yelling, screaming, hyping people up. I\u2019m ready to go. Fired up. Q: What adjectives would you use to describe you off the field? A: Stoic. Calm, cool, collected (laugh). Personable. Q: How has the \u201cHard Knocks\u201d experience been? A: It\u2019s been subtle. There\u2019s not too much fanfare about it. I know they got cameras in the building, but business as usual. Q: You were part of in-season \u201cHard Knocks\u201d with the 2021 Colts. A: That was a little bit of fanfare (laugh) \u2026 cameras, episodes were debuting as we\u2019re practicing. It was an interesting experience. Q: Do you enjoy playing chess with the quarterback? A: I do. It\u2019s a little cat-and-mouse game for sure, especially as the game gets going, you get a feel for them, what their quick game looks like, what their dropback play-action looks like. \u2026 It\u2019s fun. Q: What was it like matching wits with Aaron Rodgers? A: It\u2019s kind of like playing against Philip Rivers. Obviously I got to play with Philip every day in practice [with the 2020 Colts]. The way they process everything on the field, it\u2019s like a radar gun. They see something\u2019s off or they see a coverage or they see someone disguising or pretending to blitz, it clicks to them and they\u2019re making the right check, and obviously their arm talent is off the charts. Very dynamic players. Q: Your thoughts about Rodgers at age 40 coming off a torn Achilles? A: Incredible. Obviously the guy loves football. Q: You wouldn\u2019t be surprised by anything he does? A: No. I mean, he\u2019s one of the best quarterbacks to play this game. Q: C.J. Stroud said he would rather have Eli Manning\u2019s career, two rings, than Rodgers\u2019, one ring. A: You ask most guys, they\u2019d say Eli. You play to win. Q: Has Dexter been taking food off Brian Daboll\u2019s plate? A: He might have. That might explain the weight loss (laugh). Q: Jets coach Robert Saleh was named the sexiest head coach. Where does Daboll rank? A: I think Daboll does well for himself (laugh). Q: Do you like the new look? A: I like the new look. I think it fits him well. He\u2019s got good energy. Q: Who are linebackers you like watching now? A: Fred Warner, Roquan Smith, Matt Milano. Q: If you could go one-on-one in the open field against any RB in NFL history, who would it be? A: Barry Sanders. Q: You can defend one TE in NFL history? A: [Rob] Gronkowski. Q: You can intercept one quarterback in NFL history? A: Peyton Manning. Q: What was it like interning for Condoleeza Rice? A: That was really cool. I was there at the prestigious Hoover Institution [Stanford]. In the summer I got to work with her for her KPMG program, where she brought underprivileged girls in and held a golf tournament for them. Q: Is politics something you would ever consider? A: Sure. Growing up, if you asked me what I wanted to be when I was a kid, I would have told you president of the United States. Yeah, I think politics would potentially be in my future. Q: You have to be 35 to be president. A: I got some time (laugh). Q: You\u2019d be the first Nigerian-American president. That would be a source of pride, wouldn\u2019t it? A: Very. Q: Politics is such a headache. Why would you want to \u2026 A: I feel like I\u2019ve grown up wanted to help people. Being a first-generation Nigerian-American, understanding the struggle that my parents went through and some of my relatives go through back in Nigeria \u2026 being a Boy Scout, I was an Eagle Scout. So over my time, did a lot of community service projects, helped with the homeless. Q: What drives you? A: Wanting to be the best. First and foremost is my heritage. That fuels me every day. Q: Have you been to Nigeria? A: I have. I went for the first time in 2020, and I\u2019m going back this June. Q: What was it like? A: It was an incredible experience. I was in Lagos for about three, four days, and then I went to the village and got to see my grandma, I got to see where my parents grew up. Q: Fill in the blank: If you were NFL commissioner, you would \u2026 A: Make every field grass. From an injury-prevention standpoint, I think if you ask majority of players they\u2019ll tell you they feel better playing on grass than turf. Grass gives. If you slip, you\u2019ll tear up a piece of grass. If you slip on turf, you\u2019re not tearing up that piece of turf, knock on wood tearing something up. Q: Thoughts on Caitlin Clark? A: Dynamic. She\u2019s paving the way for a lot of people. Q: What do you make of the jealousy of her? A: Obviously you don\u2019t want to see her get hurt, so you\u2019d like it to just be healthy competition. Q: Tell me about your Presidential Travel Services. A: It\u2019s a luxury chauffeur service company I started in Miami. We have about 10 partnerships right now, in hotels and restaurants and lounges in Miami. It\u2019s been a very fun business venture. Q: Any of your teammates take you up on being chauffeured? A: Yeah, a couple. Burns has used it, Darnay [Holmes] has used it. Q: Why this particular industry? A: I vacation in Miami a couple of times, and I\u2019ve used the service and saw the demand for it. People want to ride in style, they kind of want that luxury care and service while you\u2019re on vacation. I just want to provide that for teammates and just other potential colleagues. Q: Would you ever bring it to New Jersey? A: I\u2019m thinking about it. I want to dominate in Miami, kind of set roots down there, and then transition once you get past that stage. Q: What is so great about the cars? A: They\u2019re the best of the best. \u2026 Cadillac ESV\u2019s. We got a sport, we got a regular. We got stars on the roof in one, we got another panoramic roof. We got Forgiato rims. It\u2019s just a luxury experience. Q: How involved are you? A: Pretty involved. There\u2019s probably not a day that goes by that I\u2019m at least not checking in, talk to my business partner [Sarah Singley], talk to the drivers, going over our financial statements. Q: Describe St. Elmo\u2019s shrimp cocktail in Indianapolis. A: Very good \u2026 exhilarating experience (laugh). Q: You\u2019ve been to the Indy 500? A: I have. It was cool. It was crazy to see the whole town be out, like roads blocked off for miles. Q: Three dinner guests? A: Will Smith, Barack Obama, Elon Musk. Q: Why Elon Musk? A: I think Elon\u2019s one of the smartest people in our generation right now, and he\u2019s probably on the cutting edge of innovation. Q: Why Obama? A: He\u2019s an incredible leader, obviously the way he was able to captivate America in his time. I feel like I learned a lot from him. He seems like a very poised individual, very comfortable public speaking, very personable. Just an incredible presence. Q: Will Smith? A: One of the best entertainers of our generation for sure. Just his personality, he\u2019s vivacious but he\u2019s inspirational, he\u2019s funny \u2026 he\u2019s the total package. Q: Favorite movie? A: \u201cI Am Legend.\u201d Q: Favorite actor? A: Will Smith. Q: Favorite actress? A: Angelina Jolie. Q: Favorite singer/rapper/entertainer? A: Giveon. Q: Favorite meal? A: Sushi. Shrimp tempura roll. Q: What did you think about the way the Knicks and Rangers captivated New York? A: It was inspiring. It showed us the potential that we have to really make our mark. Q: What are Giants fans like? A: I love them. They\u2019re very into the game. They love you when you\u2019re up, they talk s\u2013t when you\u2019re down. But ultimately they just want to see you win. Q: What message would you have for fans about a) Bobby Okereke, and b) the 2024 New York Giants? A: I said this for a while, I\u2019m a sideline-to-sideline, physical linebacker \u2026 I\u2019m a great leader, I love this game of football, and I\u2019m going to give you guys everything I have. And the 2024 New York Giants are going to be a tough, gritty, dominant team. We have no false pretenses. No one\u2019s coming in here thinking we\u2019re hot s\u2013t, we\u2019re going to earn everything we get, and we\u2019re going to work hard every day. Q: So in your view, the division is wide open? A: Yeah. Obviously we got a tough division. Dallas is a very tough team, the Eagles are a tough team, and the Commanders did a lot of work this offseason. It\u2019ll be great competition for us. Q: Nobody believes in this team. What are your thoughts on that? A: I love it. You know when you\u2019re an underdog, you fight a little harder, you\u2019re a little hungrier.", "summary": "Giants linebacker Bobby Okereke, a free-agent addition before the 2023 season, tackles some Q&amp;A with Post columnist Steve Serby.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/sports/bobby-okereke-sees-a-giants-defense-thats-just-going-to-take-over/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-ixxd5bvon-1717861771844.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1717847426&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:12:04", "author": "Steve Serby", "authors": ["Steve Serby"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.287}

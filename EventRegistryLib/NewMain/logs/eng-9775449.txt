'On the contrary, it is an expression of confidence in the judiciary, which alone is capable of putting an end to an abuse, in this case a judicial abuse attributable to one of the more than 5,000 judges who exercise their functions in Spain.'\n\n'You cannot separate one person into two and claim that you are going to question him as the spouse, when what determines the subject of the investigation ... is the fact that the husband of the person under investigation is the head of government,' the lawsuit stated.\n\nS\u00e1nchez has called the case a 'smear campaign' aimed at damaging the left-wing coalition government led by his Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE).\n\nSpain's Public Prosecutors' office recommended the probe be thrown out, but a provincial court ruled that the lower-court judge could continue the investigation.

The judge has not commented.\n\nJudge Carlos Peinado, who is leading the investigation, was the first magistrate to enter the Moncloa Palace complex, to take a statement from a sitting prime minister.\n\nMr S\u00e1nchez was not obliged to testify because under Spanish law he is not required to do so against his wife.\n\nThe court has said the investigation seeks to evaluate Ms G\u00f3mez's conduct since Mr S\u00e1nchez became prime minister in 2018.\n\nAt the time the judicial probe was launched, Mr S\u00e1nchez stunned the country by taking five days off official duties to consider his future but then returned to his post.\n\nThe Spanish government has pointed out that a police investigation, carried out in response to the judge's probe, found no evidence of wrongdoing by Ms G\u00f3mez.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "graham_keeley@aol.co.uk", "name": "Graham Keeley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_S\u00e1nchez", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_residence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official residence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Moncloa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palace of Moncloa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_(political_party)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vox (political party)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manos_Limpias", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manos Limpias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mani_pulite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mani pulite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence_peddling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influence peddling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Peinado", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Peinado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magistrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Spain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/IBkWdYuu9Hh1iipbeFnwsw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_the_telegraph_624/70815d69f1eb53cbfeb98901e9ba74da", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775449", "eventUri": "eng-9775449", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Peinado has said the testimony needed to be given in person at Moncloa because he wanted to question S\u00e1nchez as G\u00f3mez's spouse, rather than as prime minister.\n\n\"This isn't an attempt to suggest that someone should not be investigated within our legal system; it is about the way in which the investigation is pursued,\" said the suit. \"In this specific case, the investigation is being directed to ends that are far from judicial, and in such a way that decisions are being made not for summary reasons, but for exaggerated effect.\"\n\nThe suit argued that Peinado could not seek to question S\u00e1nchez solely in his capacity as G\u00f3mez's husband because the entire investigation is based on what G\u00f3mez is alleged to have done as the wife of the prime minister.\n\n\"One person cannot be separated out, and it cannot be claimed that a person is going to be questioned as a husband when the determining feature of the investigation is, as we have said, the fact that the husband of the person under investigation is the prime minister,\" it said.\n\nThe complaint also stressed that the suit was \"not an attack on judicial power\" but rather an effort to protect the office of the prime minister from arbitrary legal onslaughts.\n\n\"This lawsuit is intended to respect the independence of the judiciary, but also to defend it from the practices of those who operate for political motives and outside the law,\" said the government's spokesperson, Pilar Alegr\u00eda.\n\nS\u00e1nchez, who has described the case against his wife as \"an ugly fit-up driven by the far-right groups behind the complaint,\" paused his public duties for five days at the end of April while he considered whether he wanted to continue in office because of what he termed the \"harassment and bullying operation\" he and his wife were enduring.

The case, which started in April, centres on allegations of influence peddling and corruption against his wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, over her business dealings in academia.\n\nThe lawsuit against the judge says that the government led by S\u00e1nchez \"has been wronged by the crime allegedly committed\" by Peinado. Beyond displaying a \"lack of precision\" in the case, Peinado is accused of targeting G\u00f3mez only because her husband is the prime minister.\n\nPilar Alegr\u00eda, government spokesperson, said: \"This lawsuit is intended to respect the independence of the judiciary, but also to defend it from the practices of those who operate for political motives and outside the law.\"\n\nS\u00e1nchez met the judge for two minutes on Tuesday and answered two questions, according to Antonio Camacho, his wife's lawyer.\n\nAsked if he was related to any of the people under investigation, S\u00e1nchez replied that G\u00f3mez was his wife. Asked whether he wanted to testify, he replied that he did not.\n\nPeinado was also accompanied by a lawyer for the far-right Vox party, which joined the case against G\u00f3mez.\n\nThe G\u00f3mez investigation was triggered by a complaint from Manos Limpias or Clean Hands -- a group with far-right links and a history of launching politically slanted legal cases.\n\nAfter taking five days to reflect on his future in April, S\u00e1nchez announced that he would carry on as prime minister. When G\u00f3mez was placed under formal investigation in June, he said: \"I will not be broken.\"\n\nAlberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, leader of the conservative opposition, said: \"S\u00e1nchez has not wanted to testify before the judiciary, but he will answer to the Spanish people for so many injustices.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danilo_Peinado", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Danilo Peinado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_S\u00e1nchez", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Peinado", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Peinado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examining_magistrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Examining magistrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilar_Alegr\u00eda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pilar Alegr\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judicial independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smear_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smear campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence_peddling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influence peddling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_(political_party)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vox (political party)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manos_Limpias", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manos Limpias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_N\u00fa\u00f1ez_Feij\u00f3o", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252F7a583efc-f6c5-42d9-9b64-f597cd5bcea0.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775449", "eventUri": "eng-9775449", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

S\u00e1nchez offered to provide written evidence to Judge Juan Carlos Peinado, but this was rejected. Peinado insisted on questioning S\u00e1nchez as G\u00f3mez's spouse, rather than as Prime Minister. S\u00e1nchez then invoked his right to remain silent under Article 118 of the Spanish Criminal Procedure Law, which grants broad scope for the right to remain silent during investigations, trials, or appeals.\n\nThe Spanish General Council of the Judiciary (CGPJ) announced that a lawsuit had been filed against Peinado for alleged abuse of power by insisting S\u00e1nchez testify in person rather than allowing written evidence.\n\nIn a recent press release, the activist group Manos Limpias accused the CGPJ of publicly discrediting Judge Peinado to influence his future decisions. Manos Limpias has addressed their complaint to the European Commissioner for Justice, urging protection for Judge Peinado against the CGPJ's actions, which they claim threaten the rule of law and judicial independence.\n\nIn May, the Public Prosecutor's Office asked the court to dismiss the allegations against G\u00f3mez due to a lack of evidence, finding no indication of potential criminal activity. However, the investigation continued in a lower court.\n\nGovernment spokesperson Pilar Alegr\u00eda told local reporters that the allegations are a \"hoax,\" with the \"clear objective\" of eroding the president's image.\n\nThe case was initiated by Manos Limpias, which translates to \"Clean Hands.\" In April, when the investigation began, S\u00e1nchez took five days off to consider his future but ultimately decided to remain in office.", "source": {"uri": "jurist.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "JURIST"}, "authors": [{"uri": "newcastle_law_school@jurist.org", "name": "Newcastle Law School", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "saffire_penn@jurist.org", "name": "Saffire Penn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danilo_Peinado", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Danilo Peinado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_S\u00e1nchez", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Council_of_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General Council of the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_silence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Right to silence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Peinado", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Peinado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manos_Limpias", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manos Limpias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_of_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abuse of power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilar_Alegr\u00eda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pilar Alegr\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_Commissioners_for_Justice_and_Equality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of European Commissioners for Justice and Equality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judicial independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mani_pulite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mani pulite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hoax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.jurist.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/03/Spain_Flag_1648339055.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775449", "eventUri": "eng-9775449", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

S\u00e1nchez was \"absolutely calm\".\n\nGomez also invoked her right to remain silent under questioning by the judge earlier this month.\n\nShe has not spoken publicly about the case but S\u00e1nchez has denied any wrongdoing by his wife and dismissed the allegations as part of a right-wing smear campaign against his left-wing government.\n\nThe case has stoked acrimony and the main opposition conservative opposition Popular Party (PP) has urged S\u00e1nchez to resign.\n\n\"S\u00e1nchez has not wanted to testify before the courts but he will answer to the Spanish people,\" PP leader Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o wrote on social network X shortly after the hearing ended.\n\n'Looks bad'\n\nG\u00f3mez is being investigated for alleged influence-peddling and corruption following a complaint filed by an anti-graft NGO \"Manos Limpias\" -- Spanish for \"Clean Hands\" - which has links to the far right.\n\nThe only time a sitting Spanish prime minister has testified in a judicial case was in 2017, when Mariano Rajoy was summoned in a graft case that led to the conviction of several members of his party, the PP.\n\nS\u00e1nchez asked to testify in writing, as allowed under Spanish law for top government officials, but Peinado rejected the request, arguing he would quiz him in his role as G\u00f3mez's spouse.\n\nThe premier has the right to remain silent but \"politically this could look bad\", University of Alicante criminal law professor Bernardo del Rosal told AFP.\n\n\"It could create the image that he is arrogant,\" he added.\n\nS\u00e1nchez presided over a regular cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning and is set to travel to the Mediterranean island of Mallorca for a summer holiday audience with King Felipe VI.\n\nG\u00f3mez, who has worked in fundraising for years, is alleged to have used her husband's position as leverage within her professional circles, notably with businessman Juan Carlos Barrab\u00e9s, who was seeking public funding.\n\nIn his testimony, Barrab\u00e9s -- who teaches part of a master's course at Madrid's Complutense University that is run by G\u00f3mez -- acknowledged meeting her several times at the premier's official residence.\n\nS\u00e1nchez was present at two of those meetings, he said.\n\nBarrab\u00e9s - who obtained two letters of recommendation from G\u00f3mez before pitching for a public tender worth several million euros (dollars) - said they only talked about matters of innovation, judicial sources said.\n\nControversial decisions\n\nSpanish prosecutors have failed to have the case dismissed.\n\nS\u00e1nchez's supporters have accused Peinado, whose daughter is a PP city councillor, of political bias.\n\nThe judge has taken controversial decisions seen as favouring the right.\n\nIn 2015 he accepted another Manos Limpias complaint over tweets made by two left-wing Madrid city councillors deemed offensive.\n\nPeinado allowed a lawyer from the far-right party Vox to accompany him to question S\u00e1nchez as part of the probe.\n\nVox is taking part in the investigation as a so-called \"popular prosecutor\" -- a set-up under Spanish law that allows citizens or organisations to be an accuser in court.\n\nWhen the probe was opened in April, S\u00e1nchez took five days off to consider his future but ultimately stayed on.\n\nS\u00e1nchez, who has been in office since 2018, has struggled to pass legislation since he returned to power last year after an inconclusive general election.", "source": {"uri": "thelocal.es", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Local

Mr S\u00e1nchez lodged the complaint via the state lawyer, who claimed that the magistrate Juan Carlos Peinado had perverted the course of justice with his inquiry. Mr Peinado is investigating allegations of influence trafficking against the prime minister's wife Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez.\n\nIn a highly controversial move the judge questioned Mr S\u00e1nchez in his official residence as a witness in the investigation on Tuesday morning. The Socialist leader refused to respond to questions, according to his constitutional right. Ms G\u00f3mez also refused to answer when the judge questioned her earlier this month.\n\nThis was the first time that a prime minister had been summoned to testify as a witness in a criminal investigation since 2017. Mr S\u00e1nchez had asked that he be allowed to give written answers instead of facing the judge in person, a request Mr Peinado refused.\n\nThat refusal was at the root of Mr S\u00e1nchez's subsequent legal complaint. He alleged that the law allowed him to given written answers due to his position as prime minister. However, the judge insisted that he was not questioning Mr S\u00e1nchez in that role but exclusively as the husband of Ms G\u00f3mez.\n\n\"It is [Mr S\u00e1nchez's] position, not his civil status, which is the only relevant issue when it comes to any question linked to this investigation,\" read the complaint against Mr Peinado presented by the state lawyer, which described as \"incomprehensible, legally speaking\" that the prime minister should not be able to give written answers.\n\nThe judge opened the investigation in April after a far-right campaign group claimed that Ms G\u00f3mez had used her position as wife of the prime minister to influence the awarding of government contracts and Covid bailout money to firms with which she had links. More recently the investigation has focused on whether she had unlawfully secured sponsors for a university course she ran.\n\nThe government and its allies have attacked the investigation as an attempt by the political right to destabilise Mr S\u00e1nchez's coalition government. Government spokeswoman Pilar Alegr\u00eda said Mr Peinado's visit to the prime minister's residence was \"a set-up\" which aimed to \"erode the image of the government\".\n\nThe opposition, meanwhile has called on Mr S\u00e1nchez to resign over the issue. Santiago Abascal, leader of the far-right Vox party, which has joined the lawsuit against Ms G\u00f3mez, said that the prime minister's legal complaint means \"he is going to start a witch hunt against the judges who dare observe the law\".", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.mr", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": ".mr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_residence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Official residence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Magistrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_S\u00e1nchez", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danilo_Peinado", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Danilo Peinado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Peinado", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Peinado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ms", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": ".ms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilar_Alegr\u00eda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pilar Alegr\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_(political_party)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vox (political party)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Abascal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Abascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bailout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Witch-hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/S6QZPNWQCKJHKP3UAB5STAWYV4.jpg?smart=true&auth=e570f40a8db2043932e6ca0e1edf813707235d5291ec8907b5b3c8fa626bdb51&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775449", "eventUri": "eng-9775449", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The Prime Minister's decision has drawn both criticism and support from various political factions and the public.\n\nThe case, which has been under investigation for several months, involves accusations that G\u00f3mez was involved in a corruption scheme related to government contracts. Despite mounting pressure, S\u00e1nchez has maintained that he has no pertinent information to provide and that his testimony would not contribute to the investigation.\n\nCritics argue that S\u00e1nchez's refusal to testify raises questions about transparency and accountability at the highest levels of government. Opposition leaders have called for greater scrutiny and have demanded that the Prime Minister cooperate fully with the investigation to uphold the integrity of public office.\n\nSupporters of S\u00e1nchez, however, contend that the Prime Minister's decision is within his rights and that the investigation should proceed based on evidence rather than political pressure. They emphasize that S\u00e1nchez has consistently upheld the rule of law and has taken steps to combat corruption throughout his tenure.\n\nAs the case continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how S\u00e1nchez's refusal to testify will impact both the investigation and his political standing. The situation underscores the ongoing challenges and complexities of addressing corruption within government institutions.\n\nThe proceedings are part of a preliminary investigation into whether his wife, Begona Gomez, used her position as the prime minister's wife to secure sponsors for her master's degree at the university.\n\nSanchez has repeatedly denied the charges against her, saying they were baseless and orchestrated by right-wing political enemies, and on Tuesday the state attorney general's office filed a lawsuit on his behalf against the investigating judge for alleged malfeasance.\n\n\"This lawsuit aims to respect the independence of the judiciary, but also to defend it against the practices of those who act for political reasons and outside the law,\" said government spokeswoman Pilar Alegria.\n\nGomez has not publicly commented on the case.\n\nHer lawyer, former Interior Minister Antonio Camacho, said that Sanchez's testimony lasted two minutes, and Judge Juan Carlos Peinado asked him two questions - whether he was related to any of the people under investigation and whether he wanted to testify.", "source": {"uri": "sarajevotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sarajevo Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_S\u00e1nchez", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bego\u00f1a_G\u00f3mez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Peinado", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Peinado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Camacho", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Camacho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interior minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judicial independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master's_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Master's degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sarajevotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pedro-sanchez.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775449", "eventUri": "eng-9775449", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

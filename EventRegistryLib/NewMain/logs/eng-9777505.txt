These attacks came in sequential waves from specific directions toward Kyiv. Despite this, none of the drones could hit their intended targets.\n\nAir defense forces took down several more enemy attack drones.\n\nOverall, during these two waves combined, air defense successfully shot down over forty enemy UAVs in the airspace of Kyiv and near the capital.\n\nThe Air Force of Ukraine will provide exact figures.\n\n\"Under the conditions of such a dense and massive air attack, our forces and means of air defense worked just perfectly!\" Popko noted.\n\nThe massive attack on Kyiv became another test for the capital's residents. Despite the enemy's efforts, thanks to the professional work of Ukrainian air defense forces, it was possible to avoid casualties and significant destruction.\n\nFor reference:\n\nOn July 25, the forces and means of air defense eliminated all the attack drones that the Russian invaders launched at Kyiv during the night attack.", "source": {"uri": "rubryka.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rubryka"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernihiv", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chernihiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chernihiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poltava", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Poltava"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Poltava"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kropyvnytskyi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kropyvnytskyi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kropyvnytskyi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherkasy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cherkasy"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cherkasy"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhansk", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luhansk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Luhansk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sumy"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sumy"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainian Air Force"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air_Quality", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air Quality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Airguns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Airguns", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://rubryka.com/wp-content/uploads/ogimages/en_674126_1722407757najmasovanisha-ataka-na-kyyiv-povitryana-tryvoga-tryvala-ponad-7-godyn-ppo-znyshhyla-desyatky-vorozhyh-droniv.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777505", "eventUri": "eng-9777505", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 16, "textEnd": 23}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 2314, "textEnd": 2321}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

However, not a single drone achieved its goal.\n\nIn general, over four dozen Russian UAVs were shot down in the airspace of Kyiv and on the outskirts of the capital during these two waves.\n\nUkraine's State Emergency Service reported that a residential building burned down in the Kyiv Oblast at night as a result of falling debris.\n\nHe emphasized the Russian military's evolving tactics, noting on 30 June that \"the aggressor is trying new tactics -- it is looking for the right time, methods, and means to hit Kyiv.\"\n\nThis attack follows a pattern of intensified drone assaults on the Ukrainian capital. On 30 June, Popko warned via Telegram about the changing approach of Russian forces, suggesting a deliberate strategy to probe Kyiv's defenses.", "source": {"uri": "euromaidanpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euromaidan Press"}, "authors": [{"uri": "maria_tril@euromaidanpress.com", "name": "Maria Tril", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KMVA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "KMVA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv Oblast"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(messaging_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telegram (messaging service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airspace"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://euromaidanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/kyiv-31-july-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777505", "eventUri": "eng-9777505", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 367, "textEnd": 374}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 1304, "textEnd": 1311, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Authorities said 13 houses in the Kyiv region were hit by falling debris and the rest of the drones were downed outside of residential areas.\n\nExplosions were reported in four other Ukrainian regions -- Mykolayiv, Dnipro, Sumy and Poltava.\n\nIt was the first nationwide attack since July 8, when Russian missiles overpowered Kyiv's air defences, killing 42 people and injuring 190 in an attack on a children's hospital and several residential buildings.\n\nRussian drone attacks on Kyiv have become rare since 2023 when Ukraine built up strong air defences around the capital, which include US-made Patriot systems.\n\nUkrainian drone strikes in Russia have also intensified, with several reported over the past week. On Wednesday, Kyiv's forces claimed to have hit a weapons depot in the Kursk region near the Ukrainian border. The Russian defence ministry said its forces destroyed 19 drones launched by Ukraine overnight.\n\nOn Sunday, Ukraine said its drones had damaged two Tu-22M3 bomber planes at an airfield in Murmansk, in the far north of Russia.\n\n\"Destroying the enemy's aircraft that is striking Ukraine is a priority. We can reach it everywhere,\" said the head of Ukraine's presidential administration Andriy Yermak.\n\nThe aerial attacks come as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has increased his diplomatic efforts to get more countries behind his peace formula and as Russia's land offensive made incremental gains along the 1,000km-long frontline.\n\nOn Monday, Russia announced that it had taken the village of Vovche, near the strategic town of Pokrovsk, which, if captured, would make it very difficult for Ukrainian forces to hold the line.\n\nWhile Russia has said it is open to talks, its conditions are unacceptable for Ukraine, as they include occupying four Ukrainian regions, including territory it does not currently hold.\n\nBeyond the peace overtures, both sides are making efforts to recruit more soldiers and arm themselves for a long war.\n\nThe long awaited F-16 fighter jets are due to arrive in Ukraine in August. Ukraine has said it hopes that they can be used to shoot down Russian bomber planes and intercept missiles.\n\nBut some experts are sceptical of just how much the F-16s will change the dynamic of the war, especially given the time Russia has had to prepare for their arrival.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

\"the most massive attack of 2024,\" while Russian shelling of the Kharkiv, Donetsk, and Kherson regions killed at least four people, according to local officials.\n\nDuring the Kyiv air-raid alert, which lasted for more than seven hours, Russian drones attacked the capital in two waves coming from all directions, Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv's military administration, said.\n\nUkraine's Air Force said its air defenses destroyed all 89 drones launched at the capital, as well as an X-59 guided missile.\n\n\"This is one of the most massive drone attacks,\" the commander of Ukraine's Air Force, General Mykola Oleschuk, wrote on Telegram.\n\nThe attack was the seventh launched on Kyiv this month, Popko said, adding, \"At this moment, according to the operational report at this moment, there are no casualties or damage in Kyiv.\"\n\nUkraine's State Emergency Service said that in the larger Kyiv region a house caught fire from falling drone debris and was partially destroyed, but there were no casualties and the fire was extinguished.\n\nRussian shelling killed one resident of the town of Toretsk, Donetsk regional Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on July 31, while in the northeastern region of Kharkiv, regional Governor Oleh Synyehubov reported that two civilians were killed by Russian artillery over the past 24 hours.\n\nIn the southern city of Kherson, one person was killed and one was wounded by Russian shelling from across the Dnieper River, the head of the city's military administration, Roman Mrochko, reported.\n\nKherson was liberated by Ukrainian troops in November 2022, but Russian forces that withdrew across the Dnieper continue to pound the city on a daily basis, causing victims among civilians and damaging infrastructure.\n\nSince the beginning of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, Moscow's forces have systematically targeted Ukrainian energy and civilian infrastructure facilities, causing casualties and huge damage.\n\nIn turn, Ukraine has started targeting oil-refining facilities and other energy infrastructure inside Russia that mainly work for the military.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said on July 31 that its air defenses had destroyed 19 Ukrainian drones that attacked five of its regions as well as the Moscow-occupied Ukrainian region of Crimea.\n\n\"Air-defense systems intercepted and destroyed 11 drones over Belgorod, 4 over Bryansk, one each over the Kursk, Kaluga, and Rostov regions,\" and one in Crimea,\" the ministrysaid in a message on Telegram.", "source": {"uri": "rferl.org", "dataType":

Local authorities had not reported any damage there as of Wednesday morning.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Russia.\n\nKyiv and most of central and eastern Ukraine were under air raid alerts from 2000 GMT on Tuesday.

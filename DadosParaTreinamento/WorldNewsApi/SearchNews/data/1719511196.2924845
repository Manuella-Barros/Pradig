Now, after overcoming the challenges of that time, the graduates and their family filled the NOW Arena in Hoffman Estates Friday for the commencement ceremony the superintendent said the students are definitely worthy of. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty safe to say that no class in the history of Illinois has got off to a more inauspicious start. It was a challenge for them,\u201d Stevenson High School District 125 Superintendent EricTwadell told Pioneer Press. \u201cThey learned great skills of resilience and adaptability and kind of stick\u2013to\u2013itiveness and they did a great job.\u201d The superintendent said the 1,100 seniors in the graduating class \u201cproved themselves worthy of a four year journey and graduating today. It\u2019s impressive.\u201d Stevenson mascot Pat Riot entertained the audience Friday, as people started taking their seats for the afternoon ceremony. The Stevenson Graduation Orchestra also performed. Kendell Williams and Kashyap Rajesh were the senior speakers and both delivered an address. Rajesh talked about the past four years and Williams spoke of the future for her fellow grads. \u201cSo Class of 2024, we began high school in an era of TikTok addictions, a Chiefs Super Bowl victory and two presidential candidates in their late 70s,\u201d said Rajesh. And now we leave in an era of TikTok addictions, a Chiefs Super Bowl victory and the same two presidential candidates.\u201d The audience laughed. School leaders boast that 96% of this year\u2019s graduating class is headed to college or trade school. Thirty-seven are National Merit Scholarship finalists. Many are continuing their education at such schools as University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Illinois at Chicago, Indiana University, Purdue University, The Ohio State University, Illinois State University, University of Iowa, DePaul University and Loyola University, according to district officials. Twadell said the graduates, collectively, excelled academically, in extra curricular activities and in sports. He also pointed out their philanthropic efforts. \u201cOver their four years, they\u2019ve raised over $100,000 for different charities and organizations. So I think that initial adversity (of the pandemic) and challenge and setback turned into something positive for this particular group of kids,\u201d the superintendent said. Graduate Alexis Trojan, 18, of Hawthorn Woods, reflected on the pandemic and said, \u201cIt is so much better being able to be in-person and being able to really like, fully connect with my peers, it\u2019s just been a dream.\u201d Shreya Patel, Ishita Tyagi and Medha Mamidipaka, all from Buffalo Grove, agreed with Twadell that Stevenson sends a solid message about philanthropy. \u201cI\u2019m really proud to be in Stevenson,\u201d Patel said. \u201cI really like how they help the community around them a lot and they take care of others.\u201d Tyagi said, \u201cIf you have the privilege, you should be giving back to the community. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important,\u201d Tyagi added. Mamidipaka said being at Stevenson, \u201cteaches you a lot for the future because I think, especially in college, there are a lot of ways that you can give back.\u201d In her address as a senior speaker, Williams also spoke of the influence of TikTok but said that pop culture aside, \u201cGuess what? You\u2019re the author of your story.\u201d \u201cDo not regret what you have and have not done yet,\u201d Williams said.", "summary": "As freshmen, the now-graduating Adlai Stevenson High School Class of 2024 got off to a challenging start \u2013 beginning high school amid a global pandemic, in isolation and guided by national, state and local public health instructions.

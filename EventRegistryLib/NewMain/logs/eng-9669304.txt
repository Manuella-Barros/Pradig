These abuses against our children have been occurring with great intensity for years,\" said the mayor, Gutierrez.\n\nAccording to city hall, the number of visitors to Medellin has increased sevenfold in less than a decade, with 1.5 million coming to the city last year, half of them foreigners.\n\nThe city expects a record number of visitors this year.\n\n\"Most tourists don't come looking for sex... of course we have some.

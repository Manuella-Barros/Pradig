{"id": 223705780, "title": "Putting community front and centre - Kilkenny election hopeful", "text": "Local Election candidate Joe Sheridan has vowed to prioritise the needs of elderly people and to create \u2018thriving\u2019 and \u2018active\u2019 communities if elected to Kilkenny County Council in the upcoming Local Elections on Friday, June 7. Mr Sheridan joins Maria Wall and Jenny Catt Slattery along with nine sitting Fianna F\u00e1il councillors bidding for a seat in four Local Electoral Areas. The Kells native is vying for a seat in the Callan-Thomastown Municipal District which will be fiercely contested following news that both Patrick O\u2019Neill (Fine Gael) and Matt Doran (Fianna F\u00e1il) will not seek re-election in the area. For Mr Sheridan, the transition from community man to potential councillor has been an exciting process and believes his community ethos can be an asset at local government level. \u201cI want to be a bit of a bridge between community people and the council to see what can be done,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a leap, there\u2019s no question about it, but I was born into a household that was embedded in the community. My dad was hugely involved in community stuff so, from a very young age, we were always encouraged to partake in some way in the community,\u201d he said. FOR MORE ELECTION NEWS, CLICK HERE \u201cI\u2019ve been on nearly every committee throughout from fundraising to development to planning,\u201d he added. Local facilities including playgrounds and sites and equipment for minority sports \u2018must be enhanced through Sports Capital Funding\u2019 according to the Fianna F\u00e1il candidate, adding, \u2018accessibility to sports equipment in public areas must be increased\u2019. Mr Sheridan also believes his voice can be a support mechanism as a local representative in tackling social issues such as gambling for young people as well as challenges such as loneliness facing older people. \u201cI went to Lourdes on a few occasions and it was amazing how the elderly mixed with the youth. They got so much from each other, it was unbelievable,\u201d he said, adding he would push for similar engagements to support the elderly in becoming more involved in the community.", "summary": "<table><tr><td><img src=\"https://www.kilkennypeople.ie/resizer/300/200/true/2024_05_21/Joe_Sheridan_-_Callan-Thomastown_%281%29-1716306724270.jpg--putting_community_front_and_centre___kilkenny_election_hopeful.jpg?1716306725024\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\" />Local Election candidate Joe Sheridan has vowed to prioritise the needs of elderly people and to create \u2018thriving\u2019 and \u2018active\u2019 communities if elected to Kilkenny County Council in the upcoming Local Elections on Friday, June 7.

The raid on Wednesday was the biggest arrest this year, the Immigration agency said. Bali immigration director Saffar Muhammad Godam told reporters authorities would soon deport the Taiwan passport holders after arresting them in a sting operation at a villa in Bali's Tabanan district.

Those arrested were also suspected of misusing their visas, he added. However, Taiwan's foreign ministry said its de facto embassy in the country had been told that of the 103 foreign nationals arrested, at least 14 were suspected of being Taiwanese.

Reuters could not immediately contact legal representatives of the arrested Taiwanese. Godam said the scam was targeting people from overseas and not Indonesians.

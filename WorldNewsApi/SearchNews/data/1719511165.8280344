After his Edmonton Oilers saw an opportunity to truly grab hold of the Western Conference final \u2014 especially in an opening 20 minutes heavily tilted in their favour \u2014 the team\u2019s head coach departed American Airlines Center with a sour feeling. Mason Marchment scored the winner early in the third period Saturday as the Dallas Stars beat the Oilers 3-1 to even a series with razor-thin margins 1-1. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been nice to come out of here 2-0,\u201d said Knoblauch, whose group picked a 3-2 double overtime victory Thursday. \u201cDallas has a lot to say about that.\u201d Jamie Benn, with a goal and an assist, and Esa Lindell, into an empty net, provided the rest of the offence for the Stars. Jake Oettinger made 28 saves \u2014 including 15 in the opening 20 minutes \u2014 for Dallas, which was minus No. 1 centre Roope Hintz (lower-body injury) for a fourth straight game. Wyatt Johnston had two assists. \u201cI just don\u2019t think we were good enough in the first,\u201d said Marchment, whose team blocked 22 shots. \u201cJakey stood on his head and allowed us to get our feet wet. \u201cAfter that we took over and started playing our game.\u201d Connor Brown replied for Edmonton, which got 22 stops from Stuart Skinner. \u201cThey defend well,\u201d Oilers captain Connor McDavid said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing a good job of getting into lanes \u2014 passing lanes, shooting lanes.\u201d The Stars lost their seventh straight Game 1 some 48 hours earlier, but have rebounded with a Game 2 victory in five of those series. The best-of-seven matchup shifts to Edmonton for Games 3 and 4 beginning Monday. \u201cI guess that\u2019s a positive,\u201d McDavid said of heading home knotted 1-1. \u201cWe had a big opportunity tonight, and we didn\u2019t capitalize.\u201d Marchment snapped a 1-1 tie at 3:41 of the third when he tipped a knuckling Ryan Suter point shot through the legs of Oilers defenceman Vincent Desharnais and past Skinner for his second goal of the post-season. \u201cThey came with a big push,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe know we can be better.\u201d That breakthrough came shortly after Stars rookie Logan Stankoven sent a puck through Edmonton\u2019s crease with Skinner down and out. Ekholm had a couple chances late in the third \u2014 including a shot off the knob of Oettinger\u2019s stick \u2014 before Lindell scored his second into an empty net with 2:03 remaining in regulation. There appeared to be a mixup moments earlier with Edmonton changing as Skinner headed to the bench for an extra attacker. \u201cIt\u2019s always difficult at the end of the game when to pull your goalie,\u201d Knoblauch said. \u201cYou want to get your best players out there and have it set up, but you also don\u2019t want to have too much time pass by without getting them out there. \u201cWe probably would\u2019ve liked to wait just a little bit longer.\u201d Dallas opened the scoring at 3:39 of the opening period when Benn fired his fourth off a 2-on-1 on the Stars\u2019 first shot. Edmonton responded 44 seconds later when Brown slid a rebound past Oettinger for the second playoff goal of his career \u2014 and first since April 2018 when he was with the Toronto Maple Leafs. \u201cReally liked our start,\u201d Oilers defenceman Mattias Ekholm said. \u201cWe knew they weren\u2019t happy with the loss in Game 1. They were going to come out hot, but I thought we took that away from them.\u201d Skinner made a couple of big stops later in the period despite Edmonton holding a 16-4 shot advantage, denying Wyatt Johnson and two chances off the stick of Tyler Seguin. He made another huge save on Evgenii Dadonov six minutes into the second as the Stars surged forward before the Oilers killed off their 20th straight penalty to improve to an outstanding 38-for-41 in these playoffs. Oettinger then made a good stop on a Mattias Janmark wraparound chance to keep the score at 1-1 through 40 minutes before Marchment nudged Dallas ahead to even the series. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit more bitter when you win the first one and lose the second,\u201d Knoblauch said. \u201cWe\u2019re just excited to go back to Edmonton and play on our home ice.\u201d Henrique sits The Oilers were once again without veteran forward Adam Henrique, who has played just once since suffering a suspected ankle injury in Game 5 of his team\u2019s first-round series. Faksa out Dallas forward Radek Faksa (undisclosed) was scratched. Ty Dellandrea took his spot in the lineup. Taking it in Travis Kelce of the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs watched the game from a private suite along with professional golfer Bryson DeChambeau and former Major League Baseball pitcher Cole Hamels. Kelce was booed when shown on the big screen in the second period.", "summary": "The Dallas Stars evened up the NHL\u2019s Western Conference final Saturday night after beating the Edmonton Oilers 3-1 in the second game of the series.", "url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10525578/stars-beat-oilers-3-1-to-even-up-western-conference-final/", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240525230528-6652ad05b1496be6ad0943d3jpeg.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:32:41", "author": "Aaron Sousa", "authors": ["Aaron Sousa"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": -0.137}

I've got to make sure I take in the moment and enjoy it, showcase my skills and do what I'm good at.\n\n\"It will be great if we can get promoted. If you had told me at the start of the season that I would be playing in the National League South playoff final I would have said 'Yeah, alright mate.'\n\nWright, who recently signed a new deal until 2026, joined Worthing after fellow Saints youth keeper Josh Jeffries suffered a season-ending injury.\n\nIn the same week that Jeffries got injured, Wright was passed fully fit to return to regular action between the sticks.\n\nIt did not take him long to decide he wanted to join Worthing after hearing of their interest.\n\n\"When I heard about Josh's injury, I rang my goalkeeper coach and we agreed it was the best place to go.\n\n\"They replicate Southampton's first team with the way they play out from the back. My time at Worthing has been brilliant.\n\n\"I've had two loan moves this year, it's been a rollercoaster of a season with injuries. I'm really grateful that Worthing took me on and gave me the opportunity to play senior football.\n\n\"The lads have been brilliant, as has the goalie coach John Keeley. I've learned so much from him.\"\n\nAccording to Wright, the physical disparity between youth team football and the senior game has been the biggest shift for him this season.\n\nHe feels he has adjusted well, particularly when commanding his box. Playing more regularly has also been a welcome change compared to the erratic Premier League 2 schedule.\n\n\"I've played 25 competitive games this season and I was out for four months. Last year I only played 17 games and I was fit all season.\"\n\nTravel has also been a big change for the Bath-born shot-stopper. Worthing only train twice a week. On days when the NLS outfit are not training, Wright trains at Staplewood.\n\n\"I didn't think it would make much of a difference but it really has. The staff at Southampton have been really good.\n\n\"Ryan Flood, Southampton's goalie coach, has been really good for me. He's looked after me and made sure I'm always ready for Saturday games.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailyecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Southern Daily Echo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worthing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Worthing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Worthing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(English_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (English football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braintree_Town_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Braintree Town F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bath City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_under-21_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national under-21 football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Somerset"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Somerset"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southampton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southampton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_South", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League South"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Daily_Echo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Daily Echo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Development_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Development League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Youth system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southampton F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/resources/images/18046305/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555127", "eventUri": "eng-9555127", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

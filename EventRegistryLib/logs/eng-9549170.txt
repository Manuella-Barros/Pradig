The \"unlimited friendship\" proclaimed by presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin in Beijing in February 2022, just before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, moved closer to a potential two-front deadly conflict between the West and the Moscow-Beijing Axis.\n\nThe revelation came days after the House of Representatives finally passed the much-anticipated foreign aid package, which allocated $95 billion to foreign partners. Taiwan and the surrounding region will receive less than $4 billion from Washington. President Joe Biden signed the bill while Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Beijing, warning China about aiding Russia in Ukraine. China lambasted U.S. aid to Taipei, which has become the latest flashpoint in Sino-American rivalry.\n\nImmediately after Blinken's departure, China responded by probing Taiwan's air defenses. Aside from its strategic importance in the first island chain (an expanse that stretches from the Philippines via Taiwan and Ryukyu Islands to Japan and the Aleutians) and being a computer chip and semiconductor superpower, it is symbolically vital as a free and prosperous culturally Chinese state. Taiwan is officially named \"The Republic of China,\" and its thriving democracy is a solid rebuttal to Beijing's hollow arguments on the incompatibility of Chinese culture and democracy.\n\nReclaiming control over the island has risen to the top of Xi's priority list. At last year's Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Congress, he restated that Beijing would be willing to use force against Taiwan if the two could not agree on a peaceful solution. When Xi made the same claim two years earlier at the National People's Congress, he was greeted with thunderous applause.\n\nChina continues to step up its \"grey zone\" tactics. Incursions into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) are now routine, and China has also stepped up its military exercises in the Taiwan Strait. The election of Lai Ching-te as president of Taiwan will only exacerbate these trends. In January, Xi even called his election a \"choice between peace and war.\"\n\nWashington and Taipei must adopt a more active approach to deterring China as tensions rise. Taiwan, with only 2.6 percent of its GDP spent on defense, is still unprepared to resist a Chinese invasion. Admittedly, Taiwan's former President Tsai Ing-Wen made strides in addressing military shortcomings. She oversaw a robust drone program, introduced longer compulsory service requirements, and announced a historic increase in national defense spending. Unfortunately, these measures were insufficient.\n\nChina's increasing threats are forcing Taiwan to reevaluate its strategic partnerships, and its deterrence capacity. Being a \"porcupine,\" -- a static but strategically difficult, and dangerous obstacle that forces China to reevaluate the utility of attacking the island, is a good start. Taiwan must embrace a more dynamic defensive strategy that can independently deter, or at least stall, Beijing.\n\nFirst, the prestigious big-ticket weapons systems embraced by Taiwan, such as its many armored vehicles and conventional fighters, are large and easily tracked, making them prime targets for China's advanced missiles and satellite-guided munitions -- a challenge for Taiwan due to the sheer number of such weapons in China's arsenal. Taiwan must embrace interdiction and interception by focusing on a decentralized and quantitative acquisition plan. For Taiwan, many drones would better serve it than a handful of jets. If it doesn't, it may have to re-learn the same harsh lessons that Armenia learned in 2020 in the war with Azerbaijan or Russia learned in 2022-2023 in Ukraine.\n\nSecond, Taiwan cannot win a protracted contest of military might. If China establishes a beachhead on Taiwan that can be reliably resupplied, defeat is a matter of time. Instead, Taiwan needs to invest in front-ended weapons and tactics designed to deny this beachhead as long as possible. Land-based anti-ship weapons, mortars, light artillery, rapid mine-deploying vehicles, and more mobile surface-to-air missile systems are needed.\n\nThird, Taiwan needs to build up vast quantities of ammunition. The wars in Ukraine, Yemen, and Gaza demonstrate that modern warfare consumes copious amounts of bombs and shells. Taiwan must become a massive \"weapons depot,\" self-sustaining until American help can arrive. The West's lagging defense industrial base, incapable of even supplying Ukraine at sufficient levels, needs re-investment, and Taiwan independently must acquire and produce as much ammunition as possible.\n\nFourth, Taiwan needs to redirect the economic burden of warfare to China. Investing in defensive weapons like anti-satellite (ASAT) and anti-radiation missiles (ARMs) will go a long way. The rationale must always be that crucial and expensive Chinese assets should be threatened by cheaper, defensive assets.\n\nTo maximize the impact of this proposed strategy, Taipei must also make better use of its geography. Much of the island's coast is covered in cliffs and mudflats, meaning only 10 percent is suitable for landing. This makes it easier for Taiwan to concentrate its defense. The island's rugged terrain also significantly protects critical weapon systems if Taiwan leverages it strategically. Taipei is already aware of this reality, as shown by its construction of aircraft hangars inside mountains. Doubling down on these efforts will be essential in a high-intensity conflict.\n\nThe \"porcupine\" strategy may save the island money and resources, but it won't stand up to Beijing's efforts if its quills aren't sharp. China plans to increase military spending by 7.2 percent in 2024; meanwhile, after years of neglect, Washington still struggles to revive its sluggish defense industrial base. Taiwan's Pacific partners, including Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea, must contribute financially to ensure that Taiwan can defend itself.\n\nTaipei and Washington must act fast. Large-scale shifts in military strategy take years to implement, and this prescribed approach will be no different. Often, wars are won years in advance through the right procurement strategy. America's spectacular victories in World War II, which were based on massive naval and air fleets, are the best testimony to this. Russia and China are explicit about their intentions. The clock is ticking.\n\nAriel Cohen is a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center and a member of the Council of Foreign Relations.

The conference zeroed in on business opportunities in Taiwan and how Canadian companies can capitalize on investment opportunities there following the signing of FIPA this past December.\n\nFIPA helps provide more relaxed investment procedures for businesses making investments in each other's territory by streamlining the process or foreign regulations and reducing some burdens on the licensing or reviewing process, according to Liu.\n\nThe Taiwan government hopes that FIPA will help attract more investments from Canada and deliver the image of Taiwan as a welcoming market for foreign investors, she added.\n\n\"It is just the beginning because it takes time for both sides to digest and to get to know each other more.\"\n\nThere is \"huge space\" for growth in trade volume and business partnerships between Canada and Taiwan, especially at a time when both countries are looking to reduce their economic reliance on China, according to Huai-Shing Yen, deputy executive director of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research.\n\nTaiwan was Canada's 12th-largest trade partner in 2022. Canada's exports to Taiwan accounted for less than 0.5 per cent of its total exports and Canada's imports from Taiwan accounted for one per cent.\n\n\"This suggests that Taiwan is not yet considered as a main supply source for Canada and the same situation applies the other way around,\" said Yen.\n\nShe said the bilateral investment between both countries is also \"lower than ideal\" as Canada accounted for 0.1 per cent of the foreign investment in Taiwan over the past 10 years. And some areas have significant potential for growing trade and partnerships between Taiwan and B.C.\n\n\"The first potential is for agricultural products. And the second potential I would say is about the critical mineral supply, because Taiwan has a growing demand of some critical raw materials on which we want to diversify our import suppliers,\" she said.\n\nThere are about 30 critical raw materials that Taiwan is highly dependent on China, and Canada has great potential to become Taiwan's new partner in mineral supply, she added.\n\nInformation and Communications Technology (ICT) is another sector Taiwan companies are looking to relocate their investment to countries other than China.\n\n\"I understand that Canada wants to develop a strong ICT industry and it's also an important area B.C. would like to further develop. ... We can provide the ICT products and also can be your new source of ICT investments in B.C. as well as in Canada,\" said Yen.\n\nLiu said FIPA is a great step further but she also hopes the Canadian government seriously considers Taiwan's application to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) to unlock more trade and investment opportunities between the two countries.\n\n\"[We] encourage CPTPP members, including Canada, to start informal discussion and negotiations with Taiwan, so we can at least start the negotiation informally.\"\n\ndxiong@biv.com\n\ntwitter.com/xiong_daisy", "source": {"uri": "princegeorgecitizen.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Prince George Citizen"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republic of China (Taiwan)"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of China (Taiwan)"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Foreign direct investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Place", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada Place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei_Economic_and_Cultural_Representative_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of the Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communications_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information and communications technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raw material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_and_Progressive_Agreement_for_Trans-Pacific_Partnership", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Industrial_Hemp", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Industrial Hemp", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/biv/images/business/2023_09_canada-taiwan-flags-oleksiiliskonih-istock-gettyimagesplus.jpg;w=938;h=527;mode=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549170", "eventUri": "eng-9549170", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

What has emerged, instead, is an increasingly contentious world plagued by authoritarian aggression, most dangerously exemplified by the \"no-limits partnership\" between China and Russia, through which the two countries have bolstered each other's repressive, expansionist agendas.\n\nThis remains, however, a globalized world of interconnected economies and societies: a single, indivisible theater in which the security of every country is intimately linked to the security of every other. That is particularly true of the world's democracies, whose alliances and partnerships have come under assault by authoritarian powers intent on splitting and dividing the democratic world.\n\nSome have argued that international support for defending Ukraine from Russian aggression is draining attention and resources away from the task of standing up to Chinese aggression. According to this view, the defense of Ukraine has left democracies such as Taiwan more vulnerable.\n\nBut that argument underestimates the extent to which the geostrategic interests of the world's democracies are linked -- as are the agendas of Moscow and Beijing. U.S. officials have concluded that since at least the second half of 2023, China has been providing military support short of lethal arms to Russia, a significant shift since the initial phase of Russia's war on Ukraine, when Beijing took a somewhat more neutral stance. China has clearly decided that it has a strong interest not just in propping up Russia but in reshaping the geopolitical landscape in Europe.\n\nWith China and Russia in such close alignment, it is all the more imperative for democracies to act in coordination. To that end, the democracies of the world, led by the United States, must sustain their military, economic, and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. The objective of this support goes beyond returning to the status quo ante in the European continent. By helping Ukraine, democracies can increase their relative strength against the Chinese-Russian coalition.\n\nIn this spirit, Taiwan welcomes the U.S. Congress's recent decision to continue American military support for Ukraine. Such a display of unabated and unquestionable resolve to safeguard democracy does not detract from the defense of places such as Taiwan: in fact, it is a key deterrent against adventurism on Beijing's part.\n\nJust as the fight to protect democracy in Ukraine has global implications, so, too, does the defense of Taiwan. According to Bloomberg Economics, a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would cost the global economy around $10 trillion, the equivalent of nearly ten percent of global GDP -- dwarfing the impacts of the war in Ukraine, the COVID pandemic, and the global financial crisis of 2008-9. A Chinese blockade of Taiwan would result in less immediate destruction but would still cost the global economy around $5 trillion.\n\nThe reason is simple: over 90 percent of advanced chips are produced in Taiwan, and approximately half of the global fleet of ships that carry shipping containers pass through the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan is an indispensable and irreplaceable part of the global supply chain, and defending it requires a global effort. But the value of Taiwanese security is not merely economic; it is also geostrategic. Preserving the status quo in the strait is vital to maintaining the U.S. alliance system, the regional balance of power, and nuclear nonproliferation. These three critical pillars have kept the Indo-Pacific region stable and prosperous for generations and would be threatened were China to gain control of Taiwan. Economic losses and supply chain disruptions could be mitigated over time. But a geostrategic shift to the advantage of China's authoritarian expansionism would harm the world for decades to come.\n\nIn April, as Taiwan endured its biggest earthquake in the last 25 years, China continued to send warships and aircrafts across the strait -- even as its delegation to the UN had the audacity to thank the world for expressions of sympathy about the earthquake, as if Beijing spoke on Taiwan's behalf. In sharp contrast to China's feigned concern, over 80 countries expressed support for Taiwan, for which I extended my sincerest gratitude.\n\nBy helping Ukraine, democracies can increase their relative strength against the Chinese-Russian coalition.\n\nThis is what Taiwan faces every day. But when China seeks to sow fear among the people of Taiwan through military coercion, diplomatic isolation, and information warfare, the Taiwanese people respond with a whole-of-nation effort. Taiwan is particularly proud to have multiple grassroots organizations dedicated to strengthening civil defense and countering Chinese disinformation. They are emblematic of Taiwan's democracy and resilience.\n\nTaiwan's government has made great strides in meeting the security challenge posed by China. Under President Tsai Ing-wen's leadership, Taiwan has ramped up its efforts to enhance its self-defense. Last year, Taiwan increased its defense budget by around 14 percent, to approximately $19 billion, or 2.5 percent of national GDP. Eight years ago, the defense budget equaled less than 2.0 percent of GDP.\n\nTaiwan spends its resources on its most pressing needs. The primary focus has been on developing asymmetric warfare capabilities, implementing civil-defense reforms, and accelerating the indigenous defense industry. With broad public support, Taiwan also extended its training period for military conscripts from four months to one year.\n\nTaiwan can expect robust support from like-minded countries only if it makes a strong commitment to self-defense. That was the first and most important lesson Taiwan learned from Ukraine's defense against Russia; because the Ukrainians were willing to fight for their democracy, the rest of the world was willing to help. And our determination to defend ourselves will grow only stronger under our new president, William Lai.\n\nChina has already altered the status quo in several ways in the Indo-Pacific region. For starters, Beijing has militarized the South China Sea despite its public pledge not to do so. The Chinese have built ports with potential military uses under its \"string of pearls\" strategy, including in Bangladesh, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Last year, Beijing signed a security pact with the Solomon Islands and similar agreements with other Pacific island countries.\n\nChina's strategy rests on two assumptions. The first is that China must lower the potential cost of annexing Taiwan by force by making it harder for the United States to carry out a military deployment to defend the island in the event of a Chinese attack. The second is that controlling Taiwan would help Beijing project power beyond the so-called first island chain, threatening access to shipping lanes and reducing the security of many U.S. allies in the region.\n\nPreventing those developments will require an unprecedented level of determination and coordination on the part of the world's democracies. The long-standing trilateral security relationship among Australia, Japan, and the United States, and the emerging AUKUS partnership among Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, provide an anchor of stability. The nascent partnership among Japan, the Philippines, and the United States will complement those arrangements. And the recently upgraded security cooperation among Japan, South Korea, and the United States will ensure stability in Northeast Asia, which is closely linked to peace in the Taiwan Strait. These interconnected coalitions are the strongest guarantor of a favorable geostrategic environment in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nIndeed, peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait can be maintained only by viewing and treating it as an international issue. Leaders on the other side of the strait claim otherwise, of course, and tirelessly frame the future of Taiwan as an issue to be resolved among \"the Chinese.\" But the harder Beijing pushes that false narrative, the more Taiwan is proved to be on the right track.\n\nStill, the international community could do even more to deter Chinese aggression. There are three areas that like-minded countries could address more assertively to preserve the status quo.\n\nThe first is China's gray-zone coercion, which involves activities such as disinformation campaigns, election interference plots, and military provocations such as jet sorties that routinely cross the median line of the Taiwan Strait. Such operations pose a daily psychological and security challenge to Taiwan that is no less dire than the threat of a blockade or an invasion, and failing to respond to them would have a disastrous impact on Taiwan's morale. In addition to providing Taiwan with political and moral support in the face of this coercion, other democracies should also put a price tag on such Chinese tactics, demonstrating to Beijing that provocations have consequences.\n\nThe second area where Taiwan needs more help is economic integration. China must not be allowed to dictate Taiwan's economic ties with the world. And strengthening economic partnerships with Taiwan would help other democracies foster resilient supply chains for their own economies. Taipei and Washington are currently negotiating the second phase of the U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st Century Trade, a trade deal that will help Taiwan's small and medium-sized enterprises integrate into the global trading system. Once that agreement is completed, Taiwan hopes to sign an economic partnership agreement with the European Union and to join the trade deal known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). These agreements will not only strengthen the economies of Taiwan and its partners but demonstrate to Beijing that the world's democracies are making long-term investments in Taiwan's future.\n\nThe third area where Taiwan's friends could do still more is in pushing back against the misinterpretation of a UN resolution that Beijing promulgates to justify its encroachments on Taiwan's rights. Taiwan urges like-minded countries to join the United States in rejecting China's distortion of UN General Assembly Resolution 2758, which was adopted in 1971 and gave the so-called Chinese seat at the UN to the government in Beijing -- but did not, as China claims, enshrine into international law the false idea that Taiwan is a mere province of China. More countries should also exercise their right to freedom of navigation in the Taiwan Strait, which Beijing refuses to recognize as international waters. When China sees countries keeping their ships out of the strait, it concludes that its bullying tactics are working.\n\nTaiwan is a responsible member of the international community, and its position on maintaining the cross-Strait status quo will not change. But it needs the world's democracies to do their utmost to help maintain peace through strength and unity. By continuing to support Ukraine in its fight for survival in the face of Russian aggression, the world's democracies have demonstrated exactly the kind of resolve and moral clarity that Taiwan also needs from them. We cannot allow this century to witness the birth of a world order in which authoritarians can stamp out justice and freedom.

No, Taiwan has another international superstar and media darling now, thanks to Taiwanese-American Nymphia Wind's recent victory in season 16 of RuPaul's Drag Race. Each week on Drag Race, contestants serve charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent to win mini and maxi challenges, and eventually the crown.\n\nNymphia Wind's victory has come at a time when military, economic, and political pressure from the People's Republic of China (PRC) against Taiwan has increased ahead of Lai's inauguration on May 20. But her victory on RuPaul's mainstage has introduced Taiwan to new audiences around the globe. And she will continue to do so on her upcoming world tour. The more new, international audiences are exposed to Taiwan, the greater the ire from Beijing, which seeks to diminish Taiwan's status and image globally in an effort to shape policy conversations through its \"One China Principle.\" It is a policy that holds countries around the world to abide by Beijing's vision of cross-Strait relations: \"There is but one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China.\"\n\nIt may be a stretch to say that Nymphia Wind's Drag Race victory threatens the One China Principle, but her new elevated platform, and as a result, Taiwan's, will paint Taiwan in a new light, one that is separate from China. Demonstrating Taiwan's separateness from China is an unacceptable outcome for Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials.\n\nWhat does Nymphia Wind's Drag Race victory mean for Taiwan? How can Taiwan capitalize on her victory? The simplest answer is to let Nymphia be Nymphia. She won the hearts of the judges on Drag Race to secure her victory, and her legions of fans will continue to follow her post-victory. Where she goes, so, too, will Taiwan. Her Taiwanese identity immediately elevated her victory from just winning a prestigious reality show to taking on added geopolitical relevance.\n\nUpon winning her crown, Nymphia Wind exclaimed, \"Taiwan, this is for you.\" Throughout the season, she would regularly refer to Taiwan as a \"country\" and showcased Taiwanese symbols and images like boba tea and the magpie. Wind \"came here to represent [her] country\" and wanted to do so through cultural symbols, not political ones. She did not want to represent Taiwan \"by putting a flag on [her] dress.\" Such outfits would not necessarily be a major issue for another contestant, but the Taiwanese-ness of Wind's choices help to portray it as a normal country, and not \"the most dangerous place on earth\" as a now-infamous 2021 Economist headline once claimed. Taiwan's culture and society often get overshadowed by its unique place in geopolitics, so having a Taiwanese person amplify cultural symbols treats Taiwan like a normal place.\n\nAs Wind continues to speak about her Drag Race victory and what being Taiwanese means to her, Taiwan can continue to take pride in being the only Asian country to have legalized same-sex marriage, which was legalized in 2019 after a 2017 Constitution Court ruling. Taiwan also hosts Asia's largest Pride march, which President-elect (then-Candidate) Lai attended in October 2023, and hosted 200,000 participants in 2019. Taiwan's record is in stark contrast to how China treats LGBTQ+ people, with Shanghai Pride going on hiatus since 2020 amid a general crackdown on LGBTQ+ representation and rights. In March 2023, the Beijing LGBT Center closed down, too.\n\nThroughout her time on Drag Race, Nymphia Wind grew to become a symbol of national pride. People across Taiwan would gather in bars and temples to watch Drag Race this season. Wind even performed at a temple in Taipei, an unconventional location for a drag show. Her victory sparked public support from leaders in Taiwan, which culminated in celebratory and congratulatory messages from President Tsai Ing-wen, who said, \"Taiwan thanks you for living fearlessly,\" and President-elect Lai Ching-te, who thanked her \"for showing our culture in your performances so fearlessly and beautifully.\" Even Taiwan's embassy at the Vatican mirrored Lai's congratulatory message. Other leading politicians and parties, namely the Kuomintang and Taiwan People's Party, were not as vocal or public in their support after her victory.\n\nIn an interview with the Los Angeles Times' Stephanie Yang, Wind spoke plainly about her views on Taiwan. \"Taiwan to me is just a country. . . . If people think otherwise or don't know that Taiwan is a country, then it really is on their educational level. There's only so much you can do, but you can always try to improve awareness of the situation.\" A point that demonstrates why Nymphia Wind's victory and her symbolism for Taiwanese identity are important. After all, whenever something Taiwanese makes headlines outside of the realm of foreign policy and geopolitics, it eventually moves into that space. According to Yang, Paramount would only allow her to interview Wind \"if the reporter agreed not to ask her about geopolitics\" -- conditions which Yang did not agree to and Paramount backed down allowing the interview to occur. Those conditions were likely made out of fear of reprisals against the media company by Beijing.\n\nBeijing has a history of pressuring countries, organizations, and companies into diminishing Taiwan's status. From dropdown menus on websites labeling Taiwan as a part of China, maps including Taiwan as a formal part of the PRC, to organizations removing Taiwanese participants from international conferences, and Chinese Communist Party officials stalking Taiwan's vice president-elect abroad, Beijing regularly uses its political and economic heft to shape the narrative and characterization of Taiwan. Beijing's squeezing of Taiwan's status increased significantly after the election of now-outgoing President Tsai in 2016 due to her refusal to accept the so-called 1992 Consensus. And with her vice president set to take over her position on May 20, 2024, cross-Strait relations will only further diminish.\n\nWithin this context, it makes sense why Paramount would be reluctant to have an interview cover such a \"sensitive\" topic of Taiwan and geopolitics. When President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr., of the Philippines publicly congratulated President-elect Lai on his electoral victory in January 2024, Beijing warned him \"not to play with fire.\" Whenever Taiwan or a Taiwanese person attempts to elevate the country or expand its international presence or status, Beijing responds in kind because it considers Taiwan one of its \"core interests\" and an internal, domestic issue. This track record of reducing Taiwan's international maneuvering space makes Nymphia Wind's victory an interesting case study to watch how Beijing eventually responds to this positive press for Taiwan. After all, many Drag Race winners and participants go on to star in movies and on Broadway. Wind's victory is not the end of her journey, and Yang's interview will not be the only time that someone asks about Taiwan.\n\nDespite that attempted gag order, Nymphia Wind summed up Taiwan's conundrum quite well: \"Taiwan is a small country and it doesn't have a lot of power per se. . . . Which is kind of sad, but this is the situation. You've gotta play with the cards you're dealt, cleverly.\" With her victory, she is now a part of Taiwan's cards, and her ability to reach new audiences in her unique way give Taiwan a new force of nature. Throughout season 16 of Drag Race, she spoke her mind, which can be considered a threat when such comments drift into geopolitics and run the risk of Beijing's ire -- as exemplified by the hesitance of Paramount to let Nymphia address the biggest issues facing Taiwan.\n\nNymphia Wind will continue to shine a special light on Taiwan and its geopolitical plight. Her next big moment -- representing Taiwan at events during the Paris Olympics -- will likely be more scripted than she has been used to; however, she will still showcase Taiwanese culture to attendees (even though it will be under the confusing name of \"Chinese Taipei\"). That is another reason why Wind's presence and consistent use of the word \"Taiwan\" on television was so unique: in major international contexts, Taiwan must be referred to as \"Chinese Taipei,\" \"Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu,\" \"Taiwan, Province of China,\" and even \"Other non-specified areas.\" So, when Wind proclaimed, \"Taiwan, this is for you,\" it carried extra meaning.\n\nIt is these opportunities -- appearing on a widely watched TV show, touring the world, performing at the Olympics, saying the word \"Taiwan\" -- that allow for Nymphia Wind to showcase Taiwanese culture in a seemingly non-political way. And given Beijing's record on LGBTQ+ rights, it is unlikely that fans of Nymphia Wind will fear Beijing's ire. RuPaul did not repress Nymphia Wind's ability to represent her country on Drag Race. Political leaders and private companies should mirror that behavior when approaching Taiwan: Let Taiwan be Taiwan.", "source": {"uri": "fpri.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Foreign Policy Research

After completing his studies, Jarjusey decided to stay because of his Taiwanese girlfriend, the healthcare system, and the convenient lifestyle.\n\nAlthough the Gambia severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 2013, Jarjusey said it did not affect him directly because he obtained a scholarship with his university rather than through a government-to-government program. However, since the Gambia does not have an embassy or representative office in Taiwan, processing documents can be difficult.\n\nJarjusey said there are advantages to living in Taiwan over his native country such as the transportation infrastructure, efficiency of the bureaucracy, and the prevalence of convenience stores. He said that air conditioners are a luxury in his company only seen in offices and cars driven by the wealthy.\n\nWhile pursuing his bachelor's degree, Jarjusey said he met his long-time girlfriend, who has been a major factor in his perseverance. In addition, he said he remained due to a medical condition, for which he can receive regular treatment through Taiwan's National Health Insurance.\n\nIn the English teaching industry, Jarjusey said that he faced some discrimination as an African, but has since overcome it through his experience and network of clients. He said this is an area where he feels Taiwanese could improve, by opening their minds and \"give people the opportunity to show them what they can do rather than just, judge people because of how they look.\"\n\nAs he began to discover Taiwan's scenic beauty, Jarjusey was inspired by a friend to start a YouTube channel covering hot springs and waterfalls called \"Funventures Taiwan,\" but was frustrated by its modest following of 3,700 subscribers. After posting an interview with a friend during a camping trip, he inadvertently discovered a winning formula for his new channel introducing foreigners living in Taiwan.\n\nJarjusey started \"Welcome to Taiwan\" in 2022 and by 2023, it had risen to 11,000 subscribers. The channel has now reached 27,600 subscribers and has videos garnering up to 600,000 views.\n\nWhat brought you to Taiwan?\n\nI didn't know anything about Taiwan. I just wanted to get out of my country to go and study, so I started looking for universities.\n\nA friend was here before, so he told me, \"Hey, I'm in Taiwan. Why not apply for universities in Taiwan? They offer good scholarships and the weather here is similar to the Gambia.\" So I said, \"Okay, let's give it a try.\"\n\nI applied to some universities and got a good package at Kun Shan University. It's a technical university in Tainan.\n\nWhat impact did the severing of ties between the Gambia and Taiwan have on you and your people?\n\nThere were people here on the Taiwan ICDF Scholarship, this government-to-government scholarship. So when the relationship was severed, it affected them.\n\nSome were even worried that they were going to be sent back to the Gambia. But some arrangements were made and those deep in their studies were allowed to stay.\n\nBut, on a personal note, that didn't have any effect on me because I came through the school scholarship. So, I wasn't related to anything that the government had to do. So it doesn't affect me personally.\n\nBut on other matters where you want to maybe change your passport, we don't have any embassy here. We'll have to do it right directly in the Gambia and in any issue that maybe you need, some international issues or do something from the Gambia, you have to do it directly.\n\nThe Gambia is very far away, so we'll have to keep sending our passports. If the embassy was here, if needed something, you could quickly just go to the embassy and sort it out.\n\nSo it's one of the issues that we have to face.\n\nWhat are the advantages of living and working in Taiwan over your country?\n\nThe Gambia is a third-world country, so that's one big difference. You have access to so many things here that you wouldn't have over in the Gambia.\n\nThe road network is fantastic here compared to the Gambia, and the environment is cleaner compared to the Gambia. There are so many things I could go on and go on and go on.\n\nEven the government, the structure of the government, how things work, if you need something in Taiwan, they'll just ask you, \"This and this and this is what you need. You just get them and it's done.\"\n\nBut in the Gambia, you have to go through so many things and people will not be serious about what they're doing. People will not even pay attention to you.\n\nThey won't take anything seriously. So it takes time to get things done.\n\nBut in Taiwan, if you need something, it is quickly sorted out, if you get the right requirements or the right documents.\n\nAnd also in terms of just normal day-to-day living, there are stores everywhere, 7-Eleven, everywhere. We don't have those kinds of stores.\n\nWe have small shops that sell basic needs, but it's not as well advanced as in Taiwan.\n\nIn 7-Eleven, we have air conditioners. In the Gambia, we hardly even have air conditioners in our homes.\n\nYou only have air conditioners in offices. And if the weather is hot, the only time you get AC is when you get into an office, or maybe a car, some rich person's car.\n\nEven taxis don't have AC in the Gambia. So all these things are factors that Taiwan is way better living here than in the Gambia.\n\nWhy do you wish to stay in Taiwan permanently?\n\nAt first, I didn't have any intention of staying longer. I just wanted to come get my degree and get back because I had a very good job in the Gambia.\n\nI was working for a telecommunication company as a senior engineer, and that was a very good opportunity. I was able to travel even while I was there, travel to China, travel to different countries to study.\n\nSo I was okay. I needed to just get my full education, come here, study, and then go back and continue what I'm doing. Then when I came here, because of the ease of living and the ease of access to things, I thought to myself, \"Okay, I did my bachelor's, I want to study further. I did my master's. At least when I get home with my master's degree, I will be able to scale up the ladder, climb up the ladder much faster and easier.\"\n\nThen during my bachelor's degree, I met my girlfriend, who is now still my girlfriend. So that's one of the factors that still keeping me here because of her and also, my lifestyle.\n\nI started enjoying Taiwan. I started going to places and feeling like I belonged. I've traveled almost everywhere in Taiwan.\n\nWhile I was in the Gambia, I didn't go anywhere unless it was a work thing. We don't have anything like \"Go to this place.\"\n\nThere are tourist sites, but Gambians don't do that. We don't travel. We don't go to places like that.\n\nOn weekends we just stay at home, have time with our families, that's all. But while I'm here in Taiwan, I am able to travel to different places.\n\nAnd being in Taiwan, you have access to other countries around. It's easier to travel from Taiwan to other countries, but if you're in the Gambia, it's very difficult to travel around.\n\nEven if you're in the Gambia, and you want to go to the U.S., it's very, very difficult unless you have a very, very good background.\n\nBut in Taiwan all you need is money. You can travel anywhere you want. So one main factor that is keeping me here is the love that I found here.\n\nAlso, I had a medical condition where I had to have surgery in Taiwan, and because of that, I still need to see a doctor every now and then, every month. So my girlfriend and my medical condition, these two together are what are really keeping me here.\n\nWhat are the challenges of being an African English teacher in Taiwan?\n\nThere is a lot of stereotyping. People don't tend to know what you can do. They just see who you are and then make their judgment.\n\nPersonally, I'm able to go through it. I'm able to get my job and I'm doing well. And even not long ago I changed my workplace, I can easily get another one because I have a lot of experience and those who I've worked with, know what I can do, so they're able to continue giving me the opportunity to continue working.\n\nBut, if you apply to a new job, they probably will see, \"Oh, he's a black guy from Africa.\" So probably they'll just assume you won't be able to do a good job in teaching someone.\n\nThat's one of the issues that maybe Black people face here. And I remember one time before I even got my first job, I applied to many different places, and I wasn't even given the opportunity to have an interview or do a demo or so.\n\nThese are some of the things that I would feel if Taiwanese could open up their minds, and try to give people the opportunity to show them what they can do rather than just, judge people because of how they look. That will make a big difference.\n\nDo you face discrimination in any other ways in Taiwan?\n\nI would say no, I don't directly face any discrimination. Just sometimes people will say things to you that you can feel like it's more of ignorance.\n\nJust not long ago, last weekend, I was in Kaohsiung. An old guy was calling me a Negro.\n\nAt first, I asked in Mandarin, \"What are you saying? Are you speaking Chinese or English?\" He kept repeating the word.\n\nI wasn't expecting that in 2024, an old person, not a very old person. He's just a grown-up person who is still not aware of certain things.\n\nI thought he was saying something in Chinese, so I didn't understand and he kept repeating it. At one point, I got closer to him and he said it again.\n\nI then realized this guy was calling me a Negro. So the person that I was with went back to him and said, \"Hey, you don't say this to people.\"\n\nI wasn't offended. I just see him as someone who is ignorant.\n\nThere were a few encounters like that. Some people sometimes.\n\nI was going to Taitung and a person came to me, \"Hey, can I touch your skin?\" I said, \"Why do you have to touch my skin?\"\n\nThe person said in Mandarin, \"I just want to see it.\" I replied in Mandarin, \"What is there to see?\"\n\nSo things like that, I don't easily get offended. I just feel people don't know certain things, but it's surprising that in this age people are still unaware of certain things.\n\nWe have TVs, we have internet everywhere. So people should be able to be knowledgeable to know what is going on around the world.\n\nWe have different races, but still. So those few encounters. But otherwise, I didn't have any real serious discrimination. I didn't encounter any.\n\nWhat was your inspiration to become a YouTuber?\n\nThe YouTube thing started three or four years ago when I started going to hot springs and waterfalls, and a friend suggested to me \"Since you're going out already, why not make videos and put them on YouTube also?\"\n\nI asked, \"But why do I need to put it on YouTube?\" He said, \"People can make a living out of YouTube, one. Two, since you are going there already, why not share it? And many people don't know these places.\"\n\nI spent four years in Taiwan and I didn't know that there is something called something called a hot spring or a waterfall. It's only after I moved to the north. I started seeing these things and hearing about these things more.\n\nI started making videos randomly. I would just go somewhere and start shooting and taking videos and putting them out there, and people started watching them.\n\nI thought this seemed interesting. The more videos I put out there, the more people started subscribing and viewing my videos.\n\nThat first channel was called \"Funventures Taiwan.\" It covered going to hot springs and waterfalls.\n\nI did that for two or three years, but it was not doing well. I would see other YouTubers who were doing the same content, but they were getting thousands of views, while I was not getting those kinds of views.\n\nI heard as a black person, you have to work extra twice, three times harder than other people to get to the same level. But that was just a myth.\n\nI think if you do the right thing, people will reciprocate that to you. I went camping with this friend and he asked \"What is the most asked question people ask you here? It's like, where do you come from? What do you do here? Wanna make a video and put it out there? Probably people might be interested in that too.\"\n\nWe were talking about why my videos were not getting a lot of views because I thought I was making very good content when I went to places. I made my videos very cinematic and I had a drone, I would fly over and show so many things and give detailed explanations, but people didn't view the videos or YouTube was not promoting them for whatever reason.\n\nSo I've had a one-to-two-minute interview with him. I asked questions such as, \"Where do you come from? What do you do here? What's your name? Do you have any good or bad impressions about Taiwan?\" I just posted it on one of my channels and within one day it got about 500 views.\n\nWith my other channel, it would take like a week, two, three weeks before I would get to a thousand views. I thought to myself, \"Why people are watching this one instead of that one?\"\n\nI put a lot of effort into this other one rather than that one. For these interview videos, it will take a day to edit a video, but with the adventure one, it usually takes me a week to finish one video.\n\nI tried another interview video, put it out there within two days, and it received 2,000 views.\n\nI did another one, and within a week it got 10,000 views. I thought to myself, \"Let's do this!\"\n\nSo the idea of that first one was to share what foreigners think about Taiwan. It started with \"Why are you in Taiwan?\"\n\nSo I decided to share why foreigners are in Taiwan. Since Taiwanese tend to ask us \"Why are you in Taiwan?\"\n\nSo I will go around on the streets and ask people, \"Hey, why are you in Taiwan? What do you do here in Taiwan?\" Do you have any good impressions about Taiwan or bad impressions about Taiwan?\" These were the three questions that I was asking.\n\nSince people started getting more and more interested in us, I needed to change this, to make it more informative and more knowledgeable. I would talk to people and let them share detailed information, knowledgeable information about Taiwan, and their experiences here in Taiwan.\n\nBefore the videos were one-to-two minutes in length. Now, it's getting to more like 20-30 minutes per video because I will sit with people in a comfortable environment and we will talk in detail about things that they do here, and how they are contributing to society.\n\nThe idea of this channel is to share how much foreigners are contributing to society. So Taiwanese can really see that, because some people just think that, \"Foreigners are here just to exploit Taiwan, or foreigners are here just to use their medical insurance, or because it's just comfortable.\"\n\nBut it's not only because it's comfortable, because people also have things to do, ways to contribute to society. So this is the idea of sharing.\n\nThe other channel is to show the world how beautiful Taiwan is. So I'll go into hot springs and waterfalls and show people how beautiful the places are.\n\nThis channel is to share what foreigners think and what they do here in Taiwan.\n\nWhat's the most successful episode you've ever done, and why do you think that is?\n\nI did a video one month ago that got about 600,000 views. That's the most successful one.\n\nIts title is \"Taiwan is not good for foreigners anymore.\" So probably people are curious about why Taiwan is not good for foreigners, but because he says he's been here for about 50 years.\n\nWhen he came to Taiwan, there were already many foreigners, and there were a lot of opportunities for foreigners to get jobs and teach in Taiwan. But what a foreigner can do basically is mainly teach or maybe have your own business.\n\nFew will be able to have company jobs, but not many. So that's what he means.\n\nNow we have so many foreigners, so there is less and less chance of getting a job in a company and also less and less English teaching jobs available.\n\nBecause the birth rate in Taiwan is going down, we don't have many children anymore. So this reduces the amount of students, which means fewer teachers are needed.\n\nSo this is what he meant by Taiwan is not good for foreigners anymore. Because if you're coming here to teach we're getting fewer students.\n\nHe means that we don't have many teaching jobs available. I used the title Taiwan is not good for foreigners anymore and then it blew up.", "source": {"uri": "taiwannews.com.tw", "dataType": "news", "title": "Taiwan News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Excerpts:\n\nTaiwan's new government will be inaugurated on May 20, 2024. What are your expectations?\n\nHere are some expectations from Taiwan's new government by Nigeria Trade Office in Taipei: Enhanced Bilateral Relations: Strengthened economic ties, including increased trade and investment opportunities and promotion of economic and cultural interests. Also, we are looking forward to seeing stronger cooperation in the areas of business opportunities, tourism, and cultural exchange.\n\nIs this to say you foresee improved bilateral ties between Nigeria and Taiwan? There could be potential for improved economic collaboration despite the absence of official diplomatic relationships, particularly in trade, investment, technology transfer, and cultural exchanges. Because Nigeria adheres to the \"One China\" policy, major advances in formal diplomatic relations may not occur anytime soon. However, there may still be potential for cooperation and collaboration in other sectors, which might contribute to better relations between the two.\n\nVolume of trade between Nigeria and Taiwan the end of the first quarter of 2024\n\nFrom January to December, 2024, Nigeria and Taiwan's bilateral trade increased, reaching a total of USD395 million. Of this figure, Nigerian exports to Taiwan accounted for USD208 million, while Nigeria imports from Taiwanese accounted for the remaining USD187million. The figure has been rising. This suggests that trade and economic relations are on the upward trend.\n\nItems imported from Nigeria to Taiwan and vice versa\n\nThe overview of the bilateral relation between the two indicates that the main products exported to Taiwan from Nigeria include crude oil, petroleum gas, lead, oil seeds, crustaceans, vegetable fats, chocolate, ivory, precious stones, hides and skin, sea food, cow horn, ginger, natural gums, resins, spices, hibiscus flower, cassava chips, other, soap, locust beans, timber, electronic integrated circuits, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, the major products imported into Nigeria from Taiwan were industrial machinery and equipment, machinery for making rubber or plastics, machine tools, motor vehicle and vehicle accessories and spare parts, communications and information technology products, waste oils, flat-rolled products of iron, oxygen-function amino-compound, molding boxes for metal foundry, printing machinery, automatic data processing machines, polyacetals, spark-ignition reciprocating, synthetic rubber and factice derived from oils, etc.\n\nWould you say that bilateral trade and investment between Nigeria and Taiwan is encouraging?\n\nPost COVID 19 era indicates that bilateral trade and investment between Nigeria and Taiwan is growing appreciably.\n\nAs at today, what is the status of the new Trade Protection Investment Agreement between Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Taiwanese Trade Agency and by extension the MoU between Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Taiwanese Trade Agency? There were also talks about signing MoU between Lagos Chamber Of Commerce with Taiwan Trading Council. What happened?\n\nThis proposed Trade Protection and Investment Agreement and other MoUs are at the negotiation stages.\n\nWhat Nigeria can benefit from Taiwan\n\nTaiwan is renowned for its proficiency in cutting-edge manufacturing processes, especially in the fields of precision engineering, electronics, and semiconductors. Nigeria could acquire up best practices in innovation in technology, quality control, and efficient manufacturing procedures. Taiwan makes large investments in R&D, which spurs innovation and the production of technologically advanced products. Nigeria could look into collaborating on R&D projects with Taiwanese universities to create new products.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign in Nigeria, President Bola Tinubu pledged to make the South East Africa's \"Taiwan.\"The impression created at the time was that he will make South East, particularly Aba an industrial hub by deploying Taiwan's industrial (manufacturing) expertise to the region. Has the Tinubu-led administration asked you to initiate moves on how to deploy Taiwan technology to the South East?\n\nThe Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment have been having discussions with The Taipei Trade Office in Nigeria on strategic ways of deepening trade and investment between Nigeria and Taiwan generally.\n\nDuring a previous interview, you drew attention to the fact that Nigeria's Trade Office in Taiwan operates from outside the capital, Taipei. Why would Nigeria, the Giant of Africa, allow its office to operate from outside the capital? Why is it difficult to address the problem appropriately?\n\nThe movement of the NTO Taipei to New Taipei City was due to reciprocal actions of both sides and the main issue is diplomacy.\n\nIn the area of cultural exchange, what has the Nigeria Office in Taiwan achieved?\n\nAlso, how is the traffic between Nigeria and Taiwan, I'm thinking of the number of Nigerians that travel to Taiwan on business, cultural, health and educational trips and the number of Taiwanese that travel to Nigeria for the same reason.\n\nThe area of cultural exchange is still evolving. The number of Nigerians travelling to Taiwan is increasing year by year. There are currently more than forty (40) Nigerian students studying in various fields including Medicine, Neuroscience, Public Health, Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine, Engineering Information and Communication Technology, Business Administration and Chinese Language, etc. twenty (20) of the students are PhD, 6 Master Degree, 1 post graduate Degree in Medicine, 2 Bachelor Degree programmes and 3 Chinese Language students. Both the PhD and Master Degree students are on full Taiwanese ICDF scholarship. The Office is constantly in touch with the students and offers non-financial assistance to them when required.\n\nWhat are the challenges or bottlenecks that should be addressed to create the necessary enabling environment for more robust bilateral relations between Nigeria and Taiwan? The Economic ties between Nigeria and Taiwan is greatly beneficial to both. The Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment and the Taipei Trade Office in Lagos are working together to ensure stronger ties.", "source": {"uri": "sunnewsonline.com", "dataType": "news",

It provides chips to countries who need them based on the principle of fairness in a free market, he said.\n\nBolstering defense\n\nAs Taiwan's primary arms supplier and strategic partner, the U.S. can help maintain regional security through continued bilateral military exchanges and training, Chen said. Taiwan also needs to acquire more conventional hardware such as submarines and new fighter jets, he said.\n\nSince the Taiwan Strait separates Taiwan from China, a traditional navy and air force can \"effectively keep China in check,\" he said. The body of water prevents it from easily transporting military equipment and assets to Taiwan in an invasion.\n\nIn addition to enhanced military cooperation with the U.S., Taiwan must also increase its defense budget, Chen said. Former President Ma Ying-jeou (\u99ac\u82f1\u4e5d) believed Taiwan was not in danger as cross-strait relations improved, but the risk of conflict was always there.\n\nNumerous think tanks have highlighted the risk of conflict, Chen said. \"Our defense minister and other national security experts must warn the public of these risks.\"\n\nDemocratic alliance\n\nThe other facet of securing Taiwan is to seek more global partnerships, Chen said. As a member of the Taiwan-Balkan Nine Countries Parliamentary Association, the legislator said the Balkan nations were all formerly ruled by the Soviet Union and understood the impacts of totalitarianism on their economic development.\n\n\"Cooperating with them and listening to how they faced certain challenges in the past is extremely valuable to Taiwan,\" he said. In recent meetings with Kosovo and Romania lawmakers, he said they mentioned cooperation in certain areas and brought up Ukraine.\n\nChen acknowledged the Balkan region had deep ties with China but said, \"Things are always changing.\" \"Central and Eastern European countries used to be socialist and China's 16+1 is losing members,\" he said.\n\nThey also see China supporting Russia's invasion of Ukraine and are concerned the war could impact them, as they do not want to return to their Soviet past, he said.\n\nWith so many issues to address, cooperation with the Kuomintang (KMT) party is key, Chen said, but it is \"going to be increasingly difficult.\"\n\nKuomintang collaboration\n\nHe expressed regret over the KMT's fear of asserting Taiwan's sovereignty. \"The party's mindset is still stuck in 1949. It's absurd,\" he said.\n\nChen called out the \"inappropriate timing\" of Ma and Fu Kun-ch's (\u5085\u5d10\u8401) recent trips to China and questioned why they would visit a country that constantly flies military aircraft near Taiwan's airspace.\n\nHe said the party's affinity for China is hindering legislative progress to strengthen Taiwan's international space and diplomacy. \"Their worldview is from the perspective of China. They put China first,\" he said.\n\nNevertheless, Chen said he hoped the DPP and KMT could be on the same page in promoting Taiwan's defense industry, strengthening deterrence, and countering espionage.\n\nChen said he was optimistic about the nation's future, praising its large economy, advanced tech industry, and good international reputation. However, to preserve these strengths \"we need to deter war,\" he said.\n\nHe reiterated that Taiwan must invest more in national defense and diplomacy so other countries will place more confidence in Taiwan and foster mutual support. The costs are \"affordable and necessary.\"", "source": {"uri": "taiwannews.com.tw", "dataType": "news", "title": "Taiwan News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This propaganda framed the electoral choice as a stark dichotomy: align with Beijing or face war\n\nChina has been relentlessly pursuing its expansive territorial claims, asserting its sovereignty through a slew of policies and legislation. At the heart of these territorial ambitions lies Taiwan, officially the Republic of China, a solitary island cleaved from the mainland by the Taiwan Strait. Here, the narrative of expansionism unfolds starkly, as Beijing lays claim to territories beyond its sovereign reach.\n\nIn 1949, following a seismic shift in power, Mao Zedong's Communist forces usurped the reins of governance, compelling the nationalist government under Chiang Kai-shek and his adherents to seek refuge in Taiwan. There, amidst the azure stretches of the Pacific, they erected a new bastion of rule. Since the 1990s, following decades of martial governance under the aegis of Chiang's Kuomintang (KMT) from 1949 to 1987, Taiwan has blossomed into a beacon of democracy.\n\nYet, the People's Republic of China (PRC), under the Communist cloak, persists in its portrayal of Taiwan as a wayward fragment of its historical expanse. The rhetoric of \"peaceful reunification with Taiwan\" has echoed since the 1970s, yet it has gained a sharper, more urgent tone under Xi Jinping's leadership. Xi's vision of expansionism mischievously termed as 'unification' diverges markedly from the paths tread by his predecessors. Xi's stance on Taiwan is steeped in a rigorously assertive and militaristic strategy that has heightened the geopolitical tension across the South China Sea.\n\nSince 2016, the Cross-Strait relations have been marked by growing acrimony, beginning with Tsai Ing-wen's ascent to the presidency of Taiwan under the banner of the Democratic People's Party (DPP). This party, historically allied with the call for Taiwan's formal independence, currently holds a stance of maintaining the 'status quo' in its interactions with China. This stands in stark contrast to the Kuomintang, which has preserved a pro-China orientation, favouring amicable relations without pushing for unification.\n\nIn response to President Tsai's refusal to affirm the 'One China' policy, Beijing severed all diplomatic dialogues with Taipei, casting a shadow of isolation over Taiwan by opposing its participation in international forums and pressuring countries that recognise or maintain formal interactions with Taiwan's self-governing body. The strengthening of Taiwan's ties with the United States during Tsai Ing-wen's tenure has further fuelled China's aggression.\n\nIn 2019, Xi Jinping put forth the \"One Country, Two Systems\" model, mirroring Hong Kong's framework, as a blueprint for Taiwan's integration. This proposal forms a cornerstone of Xi's vision for a rejuvenated China by 2049. Yet, this proposal was met with strong resistance in Taipei, outrightly rejected by Ing-wen herself. Beijing's response has been a ramp-up in its intimidation tactics, notably through an unprecedented number of incursions by Chinese military aircraft into Taiwan's Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ) starting from 2020. This has been perceived by Taiwan as a threat. But Beijing wrongfully defends these frequent military incursions as exercises of its sovereign rights.\n\nThe year 2021 marked the centenary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), during which Xi reiterated the \"peaceful reunification\" with Taiwan as a \"historic mission\" of the CCP, though he stopped short of specifying a timeline. The intensity of aircraft incursions doubled the following year, with 1,727 warplanes, including nuclear-capable bombers, entering the ADIZ. The year 2022 saw the publication of Xi Jinping's White Paper on \"The Taiwan Question and China's Reunification in the New Era,\" which not only intensified but also codified China's coercive strategies. Unlike its predecessors issued in 1993 and 2000, this document ties the reunification with Taiwan to the broader goal of Chinese rejuvenation by 2049, aiming to rectify the historic error of foreign encroachment.\n\nMoving away from the prior commitment to purely peaceful means, the paper still prioritises peaceful reunification but does not dismiss the use of force, if necessary. Additionally, it labels any separatist movements as criminal acts of secession.\n\nThis evolving stance on Taiwan increases the likelihood of military escalation in Beijing's efforts for territorial annexation. Many experts now believe Beijing might resort to military action to achieve reunification, although the timeline remains a subject of debate. Following US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in 2022, tensions escalated towards potential military conflict. Beijing's reaction included \"precision missile strikes\" near Taiwanese waters, declared as part of a military drill -- a first in the history of these confrontations.\n\nA series of Chinese military exercises have been observed near Taiwan, serving a dual purpose of military readiness and strategic intimidation. These acts have become normalised components of China's grey-zone tactics aimed at pressuring Taiwan. Moreover, economic levers have also been employed, with China halting over 2,000 Taiwanese imports and cutting exports, tightening the noose around Taiwan's economy.\n\nBeijing's military endeavours near Taiwan have intensified, signalling a hardening of its stand to reunify the island with the mainland through force. In the shadow of the January 2024 elections, China's intrusive manoeuvres manifested in cyber-attacks and a disinformation campaign aimed at sowing discord within Taipei. This propaganda framed the electoral choice as a stark dichotomy: align with Beijing or face war. Lai Ching-te, the former Vice President and now the president-elect from the Democratic People's Party (DPP), was labelled a \"separatist\" by Beijing in an effort to erode his popular support. Despite these machinations, Lai secured the mandate of Taipei's population, reflecting a resounding rejection of Beijing's tactics.\n\nThis year, Beijing's military budget surged by 7.2 per cent, indicating an increase in aggression towards Taiwan. During the National People's Congress (NPC) meeting in March, Premier Li Qiang's report conspicuously omitted any mention of \"peaceful\" reunification, hinting at a gravitation towards more forceful reunification strategies. The persistent military incursions near Taiwan over the last four years mirror this shift, marking a departure from previous approaches to reunification, now veering towards military confrontation.\n\nThis year, Beijing's shadowy manoeuvres extend across the sky and sea around Taiwan, manifesting in the launch of 'spy' balloon arrays over Taiwanese airspace and the regular patrol of aircraft and warships. These acts, together with the encroachment of dual-use surveillance vessels, are now part of the frequent efforts to push back Taiwan's ruling establishment. According to a recent report from Taiwan's defence ministry, these actions are emblematic of China's irregular grey-zone tactics designed to wear the island nation. Just in April 2024, Chinese military aircraft and naval vessels were detected near Taiwan 207 and 144 times respectively. Furthermore, China has unilaterally opened new air routes close to Taiwanese islands, jeopardising flight safety.\n\nAmidst these tensions, a historic meeting unfolded in Beijing between Xi Jinping and former Taiwanese president and Opposition leader, Ma Jing-Yeou of the Kuomintang, a first of its kind. Leveraging the KMT's warmer ties with Beijing, Xi advocated for reunification, proclaiming that \"external interference cannot halt the historic tide of the family and country's reunion.\" This meeting occurred just a month before Lai Ching-te from the Democratic People's Party is scheduled to take his presidential oath, underscoring China's ongoing efforts to sway cross-strait dynamics as part of its reunification strategy.\n\nThe escalating aggressive incursions by China into Taiwan have significantly shaped the island's public sentiment. The majority of Taiwanese now harbour negative views towards the Chinese government, predominantly favouring a 'status quo' position. This growing discontent makes unification an increasingly unpopular and arduous task for Beijing, explaining its shift towards a more aggressive and militarised approach in pursuing its objectives.",

The CPTPP is a free trade agreement between Canada and countries in the Indo-Pacific region, including Australia, Japan, and New Zealand.\n\n\"Taiwan and Canada are natural allies with alike values. We [believe in] free, open, democratic, and inclusive market systems,\" he said at the event held at the Sir John A Macdonald Building in Ottawa. \"With Taiwan's inclusion in this trade bloc, we stand ready to contribute to a more resilient global supply chain, strengthen the market free from economic coercion, and foster a transparent system where confidence abounds and our enterprises can all flourish and thrive.\"\n\nLiberal, Conservative, NDP, and Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois MPs attended the event.\n\nLiberal MP Judy Sgro, chair of the parliamentary Canada-Taiwan Friendship Group, pointed out the robust trade and economic partnership between Canada and Taiwan.\n\n\"Tonight is truly a celebration of the friendship, the relationship, and the economic ties ... between Canada and Taiwan,\" she said. \"This is one more step forward to ultimately see Canada recognize Taiwan and accept it into the CPTPP so Taiwan can truly continue to flourish.\"\n\nConservative MP Michael Chong, who serves as the foreign affairs critic for his party, described Taiwan as \"a beacon\" of the principles of freedom, human rights, and the rule of law. He also noted that thousands of Taiwanese and Canadians reside in each other's countries, forming robust \"people-to-people ties.\"\n\n\"Taiwan is a shining example of that place in Asia that is a beacon of human rights and freedom. A beacon of the rule of law, a beacon of democracy, and that is why, folks, we must support Taiwan's accession into the CPTPP.\"\n\nThe Republic of China (ROC), was one of the five permanent members of the United Nations' Security Council. However, after losing to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the 1949 Chinese Civil War, it became sidelined internationally.

I am very sad to hear that they remain excluded from most international bodies. Taiwan's exclusion from multilateral forums means less for all. Closing gaps in the international system is important for the entire global community to be more inclusive,\" she said at the May 7 event in Ottawa.\n\n\"As a vibrant democracy and strong economy, Taiwan has much to contribute to the international community.

Tsao called the situation \"unjust\" and said it prevents the international community from effectively preparing for future pandemics.\n\n\"Taiwan's participation in the WHO would facilitate closer collaboration in monitoring new virus strains, exchanging diagnostic data, and researching vaccines and treatments,\" Tsao said. He urged Taiwan's diplomatic allies and like-minded partners to back its participation in the WHA and WHO activities to establish \"a comprehensive global health and disease prevention network.\"\n\nTsao's message comes just three weeks before the 77th WHA is set to begin.

The U.S. \"strongly encourages\" WHO to allow Taiwan's participation in the World Health Assembly (WHA) as an observer, he said.\n\nLast year, aside from its diplomatic allies, 13 like-minded

To pick one incident from a string of recent close calls: the visit of Nancy Pelosi to Taipei in the summer of 2022. Pelosi, then speaker of the House and third in line to the presidency, was travelling to Taiwan to make an \"unequivocal statement that America stands with Taiwan\". The visit produced predictable fury in Beijing: it was \"manic, irresponsible and highly irrational\", according to officials; Pelosi was \"playing with fire\". Troops were placed on high alert; military exercises were ordered; missiles were launched into the Taiwan Strait. The editor of one mainland tabloid even called for Pelosi's plane to be shot down. But the more Beijing threatened, the more determined the speaker became, and so, for a few days that August, the world's two largest economies stood one small military accident away from catastrophic conflict.\n\nHow, the observer wonders, did we come to this? There are a dozen reasons, which Sulmaan Wasif Khan, a historian at Tufts University, lays out in his deeply researched and fascinating history of the island. But the nutshell answer is that a mixture of poisonous nationalism and fudged diplomacy over many years, combined with the premierships of Xi Jinping and Donald Trump, has turned the Sino-American relationship into a tinderbox. Taiwan could be the spark that ignites it.\n\nOne of the ironies that emerges here is that the island that nationalists in Beijing covet wasn't historically Chinese, but ended up that way thanks to American interference. Until the 17th century, the people of Taiwan were mostly ethnic Austronesians. The island was then conquered by the Qing dynasty, who hailed from Manchuria, and who maintained a clear China-Taiwan distinction. After the Qing came the Japanese, who held it until 1945. It was President Roosevelt who promised it to a Chinese leader, Chiang Kai-shek, in 1943. When Chiang was defeated in the Chinese civil war by Mao's communists in 1949, he retreated to the island, which he intended to use as a base to reconquer the mainland. Only now did leaders on both sides of the strait maintain that Taiwan was an integral part of China - Chiang because he continued to claim the whole country was his Republic of China (this is still the island's official name); Mao because he saw it as a rogue territory within his People's Republic of China (PRC).\n\nWhat followed for Taiwan was a difficult balancing act. The US proved an ambivalent Taiwanese protector: successive presidents attempted to wriggle out of security guarantees made to Taipei in order to develop relations with the mainland, but time after time they were stymied by anti-communist populists in US Congress. The Carter administration at last managed to free the country of its commitment to Taiwan in 1978, recognising the PRC instead of the ROC, and for a few decades it seemed possible that Taiwan might willingly integrate with the mainland. But then came Xi and Trump.\n\nBefore his elevation to power, Xi showed every sign of following the paths of his pragmatic predecessors, who ran the \"one country, two systems\" policy that steered China towards a market economy and allowed a degree of political freedom in some territories. But Xi's premiership was to be marked by thin-skinned authoritarianism, which trashed his predecessors' careful \"normalisation\" and clamped down on political dissent, including in Hong Kong. Any hope that a democratic Taiwan might one day submit willingly to Beijing evaporated.\n\nA decade later, on the other side of the Pacific, Trump would elevate the sport of China-bashing to a level not seen since the \"yellow peril\" days. It was a theme that no doubt played well with some blue-collar voters, and it has since entered the political mainstream. Worse still for Xi was Covid - Trump's \"China virus\" - which presented the US leader with an open goal. If Trump's US had a difficult pandemic, Xi's was devastating: his government was secretive, controlling, ineffective, and the economy tanked too. All of which created new political impetus for sabre-rattling over Taiwan.\n\nChina-US relations now stand \"at the edge of chaos\", according to Khan. Beijing's aggression in the strait has hit new heights, and Biden appears to have recommitted the US to defend Taiwan militarily.

The jail terms can be commuted to fines.\n\nHowever, the salary income of approximately NT$40 million (US$1.2 million) earned by the three over the six years they worked for the company was not considered the proceeds of crime, as argued by prosecutors in the first trial in 2022, and therefore will not be confiscated, the court said.\n\nIn response, Fan, a former political commentator, said the case was absolutely politically-motivated and indicated he is considering appealing the verdict.", "source": {"uri": "focustaiwan.tw", "dataType": "news", "title": "Focus Taiwan (CNA English News)"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQIYI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IQIYI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republic of China (Taiwan)"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of China (Taiwan)"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-top_media_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over-the-top media service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chinese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNA_(TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNA (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ming dynasty"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taipei"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Taipei"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of China (Taiwan)"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_area_of_the_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free area of the Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mainland China"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidiary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilin_District", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shilin District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shilin District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of China (Taiwan)"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Taiwan_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Taiwan dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Economic_Affairs_(Taiwan)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Economic Affairs (Taiwan)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://imgcdn.cna.com.tw/Eng/images/default.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549170", "eventUri": "eng-9549170", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 97, "textEnd": 102}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

No less than President Marcos is feeling the tension amid the grim possibility that things could get out of hand. His hecklers should instead compliment and support him for his moves meant to protect the country, including attending the United States-Japan-Philippines trilateral summit on April 11, where the three allies forged a US-Indo-Pacific strategy.\n\nAnother crucial move of his administration is holding an extended military training exercise in the West Philippine Sea from April 22 to May 10. The exercise included maritime operations of the Philippine, US, and French navies in the country's exclusive economic zone. A unique feature of the exercise is the participation of 14 nations whose representatives acted as international observers of the event. The willingness of the 14 nations to get involved reflects their hope for the promotion of peace and harmony in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nChina's risky gray-zone tactics indicate its belief that it now has tactical and operational edge over Taiwan's military with its strong air defense systems, considerable firepower, network-centric warfare capabilities, and substantial manpower. Smug in its military capability and thoughts of the distractions faced by the US in helping Israel and Ukraine, China might conclude that the current climate is now the \"ripe moment\" to attack Taiwan, and that it no longer has to wait for the 2049 commemoration of the founding of the People's Liberation Army in retaking Taiwan.\n\nChina considers Taiwan a linchpin to its hegemonic ambitions across the entirety of East Asia. Should it succeed in occupying Taiwan and deploying military units in it, it would be well-positioned to deny the US and its allies the ability to maintain a forward presence in the Pacific. The net result would be greater freedom of action for China across East Asia and easier pursuit of its further territorial ambitions.\n\nChina, however, needs to be reminded that defeating Taiwan would not be a walk in the park. Invading a developed island by itself would be a formidable challenge, given Taiwan's rugged geography, formidable military preparations, resolute capacity, and vital role within the global supply chain. Neither should China forget that it would be facing the richest and third-richest and battle-tested nations in the world, which will not allow it to put in jeopardy the $5.3 trillion worth of goods and the over 50 percent of the world's shipping containers that pass through the West Philippine Sea.\n\nFurthermore, the latest condemnation by the Group of Seven (G7) nations issued on April 19 of China's actions in Philippine waters and the 14-nation participation in the Balikatan exercises should send a strong message to China to abandon its plan of invading Taiwan, as it would disrupt international relations, cause a breakdown in global supply chains, result in sanctions by the G7 countries on China's financial sector, and risk another world war.\n\nChina should also take note of Bloomberg Economics' observation that its intended action will make it suffer a 16.7 percent drop in its GDP. Thus, it may be observed that given Taiwan's geographic advantages and robust defense system, the public and international disapproval of China's behavior, the consequent significant cost to global supply chains, the drastic GDP drop for China and the world, and the disturbance in international relations -- an invasion of Taiwan becomes a formidable and risky undertaking.\n\nThe situation can only lead to the conclusion that maintaining the status quo is in the best interest of all parties involved. And operationalizing this status quo means the formulation of an effective code of conduct in the Indo-Pacific region, as well as the strict observance of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and the Permanent Court of Arbiration Arbitral Award to the Philippines.", "source": {"uri": "opinion.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer"},

The panel explored how Taiwan and neighboring disaster-prone countries, Japan and the Philippines, have responded to disasters and are preparing for future crises.\n\nSteven Pan (\u6f58\u601d\u4eae), chair of Silks Hotel Group, said that after the quake, hundreds of tourists and employees were trapped at Taroko Jingying Hotel in Hualien. Cell towers were down, but the hotel had a fixed line that allowed everyone to contact their family for two minutes to report they were safe.\n\n\"Without communication, everyone is panicking. How do you get up and start helping each other? It's that connection and connectivity that is crucial,\" Pan said.\n\nJoe Huang (\u9ec3\u601d\u6d69), who leads volunteer planning at Buddhist Tzu Chi Charity Foundation, emphasized disaster prevention education. He said that in 2019, the 20th anniversary of Taiwan's 921 Earthquake in 1999, which killed 2,415 people and injured more than 11,000, Tzu Chi began cooperating with the Ministry of Education to ensure young people learn earthquake response measures.\n\nHuang said Tzu Chi volunteers are always the first to arrive at disaster sites \"because volunteers are locals.\"\n\nKristoffer Berse, dean at the University of the Philippines Diliman, added, \"Disasters are from political and economic choices. Earthquakes themselves will not kill people, but buildings will.\" He said the Philippines requires local governments to develop natural disaster risk assessments and consider cross-city and cross-administrative contingency plans.\n\nShuhei Nomura, associate professor at Keio University School of Medicine, focused on the impact of natural disasters on the elderly, given that Taiwan and Japan are both aging societies. He said many elderly people in nursing homes were not able to survive an evacuation, as their health deteriorated and they died within a month.\n\nThe closing keynote featured Vice President-elect Hsiao Bi-khim (\u856d\u7f8e\u7434), who spoke of Taiwan as an \"Island of Resilience\" that can lead Asia in three aspects: politics, society, and the economy. Hsiao said Taiwan leads in Asia in terms of political freedom, human rights, free speech, and media, and since 1996, it has had free and fair elections.\n\n\"Taiwan has made itself home-based for an increasing number of international NGOs, think tanks, and media organizations that require a free political environment to function,\" she said. \"Our democracy continues to move forward, recharged by a population determined not to go back to authoritarianism.\"\n\nIn terms of society, Taiwanese have been leaders in social progress, according to Hsiao. \"Though far from reaching ideal standards, Taiwan's advances in universal health care, gender equality, LGBTQ rights, and labor rights inspire others in the region,\" she said.\n\nHsiao also mentioned Taiwan is one of the most generous suppliers of humanitarian assistance and charity. \"From donating PPEs during the pandemic to providing hot meals to disaster-affected zones, wherever there is a disaster, there will be some form of Taiwanese help,\" she said.\n\nDespite its international isolation, \"Taiwan has managed to lead in soft power as a force for good,\" Hsiao added.\n\nOn the economic front, \"Taiwan was once synonymous with low-cost, high-volume production, but we have reinvented ourselves as a hotbed of innovation,\" Hsiao said.\n\nWhile news focuses on the tech sector, \"Taiwan's strengths remain in our small and medium-sized enterprises ... attracting those who cherish the free and international environment where innovation can take place,\" Hsiao said.", "source": {"uri": "taiwannews.com.tw",

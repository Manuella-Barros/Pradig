His 15-year-old daughter Naomi was upstairs in the children\u2019s psychiatric ward, hospitalized for major depression and suicidal ideation, and he was spiraling into self-blame. \u201cMaybe if I had been a better parent, I would\u2019ve caught this earlier and helped her,\u201d Sacks remembers thinking. He and his wife, Masako, a bank manager, \u201cwere completely unmoored,\u201d he says. \u201cWe thought, \u2018Where do we go from here?\u2019\" As he waited for visiting hours to see his daughter, the comic book writer and former Daily News journalist pulled out an old reporter\u2019s notebook and stared at the blank page. \u201cI wanted to come up with a story that would inspire Naomi to want to live,\u201d says Ethan, 51. He scrawled a single sentence in his notebook: \u201cA girl who doesn\u2019t know if she wants to live is the only one who can save all life on Earth.\u201d Over the next few years that nascent idea became a fully realized labor of love for both Ethan and Naomi, now 20. The result, A Haunted Girl, a comic cowritten by the father-daughter team with art by Sacks\u2019s collaborator Marco Lorenzana, is a supernatural horror tale that follows teen heroine Cleo as she navigates life after a suicide attempt and battles a demon apocalypse that only she can prevent. A book version of the four-part series, which includes a mental health guide and resources, has just been released. \u201cFor Naomi, I hope the experience is empowering,\u201d says Ethan, who has authored several Marvel and Star Wars comics. \u201cAnd if we reach people and help through the book, that\u2019s a plus.\u201d A Haunted Girl \u201cinvolves the supernatural, but there\u2019s also a real-life story many kids go through,\u201d says Brett Wean, director of writing and entertainment outreach for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, who consulted on the comic. \u201cIt feels authentic\u2014and positive.\u201d Cleo\u2019s story begins in a hospital, much like the one Naomi found herself in when she was a fresh-man at New York City\u2019s Stuyvesant High School. After struggling with anxiety for years, Naomi had begun experiencing symptoms of depression.\u201cEverything felt gray, and it was hard to visualize the future,\u201d she says. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like things could get better.\u201d When her school learned Naomi told a friend about a suicide \u201cdaydream,\u201d a school social worker called her parents. \u201cThey said, \u2018You need to pick up your daughter. We can\u2019t let her leave by herself. She\u2019s suicidal,\u2019 \u201d Ethan recalls. \u201cWe were in uncharted territory.\u201d That began a series of hospital stays, totaling more than five weeks, followed by months of outpatient treatment. As Naomi began to improve with therapy and medication, Ethan realized he didn\u2019t just wantto write a story for his daughter\u2014he needed her help in telling it. \u201cI thought it would offer some catharsis for her, but also, she has an authenticity I don\u2019t,\u201d Ethan says. \u201cTogether we could do some-thing better to help than I could alone.\u201d With Naomi\u2019s input Cleo became a more realistic hero. \u201cI wanted her to be a little bit miserable because I had felt miserable,\u201d Naomi says. \u201cWe wanted her to be relatable, and to show that it can get better.\u201d That's an important message for others who are struggling says Dr. Vasilis Pozios of the American Psychiatric Association, another consultant for the book. \"The story treats mental illness like a physical health condition in that it's a controllable condition like diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol,\" he says. \"With proper treatment, people can live their lives as they wish.\" Because of her own history, Naomi was able to provide true-to-life details for the story, like the centering techniques Cleo uses to calm herself, which Naomi learned in dialectical behavior therapy\u2014and she added a few quirks from the psych ward. \u201cOne thing I particularly wanted to include was the paper spoons in the hospital,\u201d Naomi says. \u201cIn my second hospitalization, someone tried to self-harm with plastic utensils, so we only had paper spoons. That did not go well\u2014a lot of us gave up and [ate] with our hands!\u201d Naomi also understood the challenges Cleo faces returning to school after her hospitalization.\u201cIt was like I fell off the planet,\u201d she recalls of her own experience. \u201cAnd when I came back, I didn\u2019t know what to do socially. It was intimidating.\u201d The climactic fight between Cleo and the demon felt familiar as well: \u201cIn the book there\u2019s an external demon saying things like, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be easier to give up?\u2019 but it does feel like voices say that in your internal thoughts, and it\u2019s hard to fight.\u201d After writing together, \u201cI had more of an understanding of what she went through,\u201d Ethan says. For Naomi, who just finished her sophomore year in environmental studies at McGill University in Montreal, the book has provided a measure of her progress. \u201cI can see how far I\u2019ve come, and that\u2019s reassuring,\u201d she says. Naomi says she hopes the story shares a sense of possibility with readers:\u201cI want people to know it may not be as smooth as you hope but there's a path to feeling happy and content in life.\" If you or someone you know needs mental health help, text \u201cSTRENGTH\u201d to the Crisis Text Line at 741741 or visit crisistextline.org.", "summary": "When his teen daughter faced a crisis, comic book writer Ethan Sacks dreamed up a hero to inspire her.

allow third-party mobile wallet and payment service providers access to the contactless payment function in its iOS operating system.\n\nAfter Apple tweaked its proposals following testing and feedback, the Commission said it \"concluded that Apple's final commitments would address its competition concerns\".\n\n\"Today's commitments end our Apple Pay investigation,\" Margrethe Vestager, the commission's executive vice president for competition policy, told a press briefing in Brussels. \"The commitments bring important changes to how Apple operates in Europe to the benefit of

use important iPhone verification functions like Face ID, Ms Vestager said.\n\nMobile wallets rely on near-field communication, or NFC, which uses a chip to wirelessly communicate with a merchant's payment terminal.\n\nThe commission had charged the company with denying others access to Apple Pay, which it said is the biggest NFC-based mobile wallet on the market.\n\nThe changes that Apple is making are to remain in force for a decade and apply throughout the bloc's 27 countries plus Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein and will be monitored by a trustee.\n\nApple must make the changes in the EU by July 25.\n\n\"As of this date, developers will be able to offer a mobile wallet on the iPhone with the same 'tap-and-go' experience that so far has been reserved for Apple Pay,\" Ms Vestager said.\n\nApple said in a statement that it is \"providing developers in the European Economic Area with an option to enable NFC contactless payments and contactless transactions\" for uses like car keys, corporate badges, hotel keys, and concert tickets.\n\nBreaches of EU competition law can draw fines worth up to 10% of a company's annual global revenue, which in Apple's case, could have

The commitments address the Commission's competition concerns relating to Apple's refusal to grant rivals access to a standard technology used for contactless payments with iPhones in stores ('Near-Field-Communication (NFC)' or 'tap and go').\n\nThe Commission's competition concerns\n\nApple Pay is Apple's own mobile wallet used to allow iPhone users to pay with their devices in stores and online. Apple's iPhones run exclusively on Apple's operating system 'iOS'. Apple controls every aspect of its ecosystem, including access conditions for mobile wallet developers.\n\nThe Commission preliminarily found that Apple has significant market power in the market for smart mobile devices and a dominant position on the in-store mobile wallet market on iOS. Apple Pay is the only mobile wallet that may access the NFC hardware and software ('NFC input') on iOS to make payments in stores, as Apple does not make it available to third-party mobile wallet developers.\n\nIn its investigation, the Commission preliminarily concluded that Apple abused its dominant position by refusing to supply the NFC input on iOS to competing mobile wallet developers, while reserving such access only to Apple Pay.\n\nThe Commission's preliminary view is that Apple's refusal excluded Apple Pay's rivals from the market and led to less innovation and choice for iPhone mobile wallets users.\n\nSuch behaviour may breach Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ('TFEU'), which prohibits the abuse of a dominant position.\n\nThe commitments\n\nTo address the Commission's competition concerns, Apple initially offered the following commitments:\n\nTo allow third-party wallet providers access to the NFC input on iOS devices free of charge, without having to use Apple Pay or Apple Wallet. Apple will enable access to NFC in Host Card Emulation mode ('HCE'). HCE allows to securely store payment credentials and complete transactions using NFC, without relying on an in-device secure element.To apply a fair, objective, transparent and non-discriminatory procedure and eligibility criteria to grant NFC access to third-party mobile wallet app developers.To enable users to easily set an HCE payment app as their default app for payments in stores and to use relevant functionalities such as Field Detect (which opens the user's default payment app when a locked iPhone is presented to an NFC reader), Double-click (which launches the default payment app when double clicking the phone's side or home button), and authentication tools such as Touch ID, Face ID, and device passcode.To establish a monitoring mechanism and separate dispute settlement system to allow for independent review of Apple's decisions restricting access.To apply the abovementioned commitments to all third-party mobile app developers established in the European Economic Area ('EEA') and to all iOS users with an Apple ID registered in the EEA, also while traveling temporarily outside the EEA.\n\nBetween 19 January 2024 and 19 February 2024, the Commission market tested Apple's commitments and consulted all interested third parties to verify whether they would remove its competition concerns. In light of the outcome of this market test, Apple amended the initial proposal and committed:\n\nTo extend the possibility to initiate payments with HCE payment apps at other industry-certified terminals, such as merchant phones or devices used as terminal (so called SoftPOS), if this is enabled.To explicitly acknowledge that HCE developers are not prevented from combining the HCE payment function with other NFC functionalities or use cases.To remove the requirement for developers to have a licence as a Payment Service Provider ('PSP') or a binding agreement with a PSP to access the NFC input.To allow NFC access for developers to pre-build payment apps for third party mobile wallet providers.To update the HCE architecture to comply with evolving industry standards used by Apple Pay, and to continue to update standards even if they are no longer implemented by Apple Pay, under certain conditions.To enable developers to prompt users to easily set up their default payment app and redirect users to the default NFC settings page, enabling defaulting with only a few clicks.To comply with the same industry standard-specifications as developers of HCE payment apps and to protect confidential information obtained in the context of an audit.To shorten deadlines for resolving disputes. Moreover, Apple offered additional independence and procedural guarantees for the monitoring trustee.\n\nThe Commission concluded that Apple's final commitments would address its competition concerns over Apple's restriction of third-party mobile wallet developers' access to NFC payments in stores for EEA iOS users. It therefore decided to make them legally binding on Apple.\n\nThe commitments will remain in force for ten years and apply throughout the EEA. Their implementation will be monitored by a monitoring trustee appointed by Apple who will report to the Commission for the same time period.\n\nApple's commitments are without prejudice to Apple's current or future obligations under other regulations, in particular relating to other use cases and functionalities within the scope of the Digital Markets Act (Regulation 2022/1925) and the implementation of the Digital Euro.\n\nBackground\n\nArticle 102 of the TFEU prohibits the abuse of a dominant position that may affect trade within the EU and prevent or restrict competition. The implementation of this provision is defined in Regulation No 1/2003, which can also be applied by the national competition authorities.\n\nFollowing the opening of a formal antitrust investigation into Apple's behaviour in June 2020, the Commission sent Apple a Statement of Objections in May 2022. In January 2024, the Commission market tested Apple's first set of commitments. In parallel to today's Article 9 commitments decision, the Commission also adopted today a second decision closing its investigation into online restrictions and alleged refusals of access to Apple Pay for specific products of rivals that the Commission also opened in June 2020. This second decision also closes all proceedings in relation to the UK, which no longer forms part of the EEA.\n\nArticle 9 (1) of Regulation 1/2003 enables companies investigated by the Commission to offer commitments in order to meet the Commission's concerns and empowers the Commission to adopt a decision to make such commitments binding on the companies. Article 27(4) of Regulation 1/2003 requires that before adopting such decision the Commission shall provide interested third parties with an opportunity to comment on the offered commitments.\n\nIf the market test indicates that the commitments are a satisfactory way of addressing the Commission's competition concerns, the Commission may adopt a decision making the commitments legally binding on the company concerned. Such a decision would not conclude that there is an infringement of EU antitrust rules but would legally bind the company to comply with the commitments it has offered.\n\nIf the company concerned does not honour such commitments, the Commission may impose a fine of up to 10% of its total annual turnover, without having to find an infringement of EU antitrust rules, or a periodic penalty payment of 5% per day of its daily turnover for every day of non-compliance.\n\n/Public Release.

US issues\n\nApple is facing similar issues across the pond over its mobile payments system and other behaviours.\n\nIn July 2022 a class action lawsuit was filed in a San Francisco federal courtroom, alleging Apple was thwarting competition for its Apple Pay mobile wallet.\n\nIn September 2023 a US judge ordered Apple to face antitrust lawsuit by payment card issuers for over the Apple Pay mobile wallet.\n\nThen in March 2024 the US DoJ and US states filed a case against Apple for violating antitrust laws.

Commission EVP Margrethe Vestager, who heads up the EU's competition division, announced the development in a press conference Thursday.\n\nApple has until July 25 to implement changes that will allow developers of rival mobile wallets to offer contactless payment by the predominant technology used in the EU (NFC) -- enabling them to offer their users \"tap and go\" payments, she said. They will also be able to access key iOS features, such as double click to launch their apps as well as Face ID, Touch ID and passcodes for authentication.\n\nApple will also let users set a third-party wallet app as their default, rather than its own Apple Wallet.\n\nThe bloc's competition division opened a formal investigation of Apple Pay, Apple's mobile payment and mobile wallet technology, back in June 2020, following a number of complaints. Initially the probe was scoped to look at Apple Pay as a whole. Later the case narrowed to focus on the use of Apple's technology for contactless payments.\n\nReporting preliminary findings two years later in May 2022, the EU's said it had found Apple abused a dominant position to block competitors from providing NFC-enabled contactless payments on the iPhone -- meaning they were unable to develop rival mobile wallets and compete fairly with Apple Pay.\n\nThe EU took specific issue with Apple restricting the ability of rivals to build wallet apps that can wirelessly communicate with NFC payments terminals, as Apple Pay can. It suspected the restriction of enabling Apple's contactless payment tech to gain market share unfairly. And the EU said it wanted Apple to provide full access to NFC to allow competitors to develop alternative wallets.\n\nApple was invited to respond to the EU's May 2022 Statement of Objections. The next major development came in January 2024 when it offered to make changes aimed at settling the case. Its proposal offered to let third parties developing mobile wallet and payment services gain fuller access to NFC functionality on iOS devices, free of charge, via a set of APIs without having to use Apple's payment or wallet tech.\n\nThe offer would still bar rivals from accessing a special chip on Apple devices called the secure element, which it uses to enhance the security of transactions made using Apple Pay. But Apple said it would provide \"equivalent access\" to NFC components through a mechanism called \"Host Card Emulation ('HCE') mode\". It said this would let third-party wallets store payment credentials and complete transactions using NFC securely, without accessing the secure element.\n\nOther commitments Apple offered at the time included pledges to provide third parties with additional features and functionality, such as defaulting of preferred payment apps and access to authentication features like Face ID, its biometric authentication tech. It also promised to apply FRAND (Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory) terms when deciding whether to grant access to NFC.\n\nVestager said Thursday it has accepted Apple's offer after pressing for some improvements.\n\n\"By excluding competitors from the market, it may have had a negative impact on innovation. This reduction in choice and innovation is harmful. It's harmful to consumers and is illegal under EU competition rules. To address these concerns, Apple offered a set of commitments earlier this year,\" she said.\n\n\"Over the last month, we tested a package, we got feedback on whether the remedies could work, if they could address our concerns. The issue raised a lot of interest. Many banks, app developers, card issuers, financial associations gave us their feedback. We looked very carefully at those comments, and we asked Apple to improve their commitments. Then Apple offered improved remedies, and here we are today, making those remedies binding on Apple.\"\n\nDetails of exactly how Apple's enhanced its January offer following industry feedback are set out in the Commission's press release -- but they include committing to:\n\nSince the EU opened the Apple Pay antitrust case the bloc has passed an update to its competition rulebook which is intended to boost the contestibility of digital markets by applying upfront obligations on a number of major platforms, including Apple's iOS, so that tech giants cannot block competitors from accessing key infrastructure they operate. EU lawmakers want the Digital Markets Act (DMA) to speed up the process of resetting digital dominance and restoring competition to tipped markets.\n\nShortly after the EU announced it was consulting with industry stakeholders on Apple's Apple Pay offer, the company suggested the changes it had proposed also comply with DMA requirements.\n\nVestager said Apple's commitments on Apple Pay that the EU has accepted go further than what's required by the DMA. \"For instance, they include monitoring and dispute resolution resolution mechanisms,\" she noted, adding: \"This shows that antitrust enforcement goes hand in hand with the DMA.\"\n\n\"From now on, Apple can no longer use its control or the iPhone ecosystem to keep mobile wallets out of the market. Competing wallet developers as well as consumers will benefit from these changes, opening up innovation and choice while, of course, keeping payments secure.\"\n\nThe commitments are binding on Apple for 10 years. Failure to abide by them could be met with stiff penalties.\n\nReached for comment, an Apple spokesperson sent this statement: \"Apple is providing developers in the European Economic Area with an option to enable NFC contactless payments and contactless transactions for car keys, closed loop transit, corporate badges, home keys, hotel keys, merchant loyalty/rewards, and event tickets from within their iOS apps using Host Card Emulation based APIs. Apple Pay and Apple Wallet will continue to be available in the EEA for users and developers, and will continue to provide an easy, secure and private way to pay, as well as present passes seamlessly from Apple Wallet.\"", "source": {"uri": "techcrunch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechCrunch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "natasha_lomas@techcrunch.com", "name": "Natasha Lomas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Near-field communication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pay", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_wallet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Digital wallet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contactless_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Contactless payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_ID", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Face ID"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margrethe_Vestager", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Margrethe Vestager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Authentication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_ID", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touch ID"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wireless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wallet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Wallet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Wallet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_service_provider", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Payment service provider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emulator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biometrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Economic Area"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1814216780-e1711055311427.jpg?resize=1200,674", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724076", "eventUri": "eng-9724076", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 292, "textEnd": 299}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-06-", "textStart": 925, "textEnd": 934}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

In response, Apple proposed in January to grant third-party mobile wallet and payment service providers access to the contactless payment function in its iOS operating system.\n\nAfter refining its proposals based on testing and feedback, the commission stated that these \"final commitments\" would address its competition concerns. \"Today's commitments end our Apple Pay investigation,\" Margrethe Vestager, the commission's executive vice-president for competition policy, announced at a press briefing in Brussels. \"The commitments bring important changes to how Apple operates in Europe to the benefit of competitors and customers.\"\n\nThis agreement promises more choice for Europeans. iPhone users will have the ability to set a default wallet of their choice, while mobile wallet developers will gain access to crucial iPhone verification functions like Face ID, Vestager explained.\n\nMobile wallets depend on near-field communication (NFC), which uses a chip to wirelessly communicate with a merchant's payment terminal. The commission had previously charged Apple with denying others access to Apple Pay, which it identified as the largest NFC-based mobile wallet on the market.\n\nApple's changes, which are set to remain in place for a decade, will be applicable across the 27 countries of the bloc, as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein, with a trustee overseeing the process. The tech giant must implement these changes in the EU by July 25. \"As of this date, developers will be able to offer a mobile wallet on the iPhone with the same \"tap and go\" experience that so far has been reserved for Apple Pay,\" Vestager said.\n\nIn a prepared statement, Apple said it is \"providing developers in the European Economic Area with an option to enable NFC contactless payments and contactless transactions\" for uses like car keys, corporate badges, hotel keys, and concert tickets. Violations of EU competition law can result in fines up to 10% of a company's annual global revenue, which in Apple's case, could have amounted to tens of billions of euros (dollars).", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lawrence_matheson@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lawrence Matheson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_wallet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Digital wallet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margrethe_Vestager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Margrethe Vestager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_service_provider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Payment service provider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Near-field communication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_ID", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face ID"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contactless_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contactless payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_terminal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Payment terminal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Economic Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liechtenstein", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liechtenstein"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Liechtenstein"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/money/article33219351.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_europe-apple.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724076", "eventUri": "eng-9724076", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 1855, "textEnd": 1862}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The key commitment is that Apple will let third-party wallet providers access the NFC technology on iOS devices free of charge, without having to use Apple Pay or Apple Wallet.\n\nNFC - or near-field communication - lets people make secure transactions with their mobile and quickly connect electronic devices. This is also known as 'tap and go' tech. Apple Pay is an example of a service that uses NFC, letting iPhone users quickly make payments from their devices.\n\nBut the European Commission claimed last year that Apple abused its dominant market position by preventing rivals from accessing NFC technology on iOS systems, benefitting its own Apple Pay service.\n\nIn response, Apple pledged to make various concessions around how it handles contactless payments on its iPhone. This was likely done over the risk of fines, as there was a threat that the EU could have penalised Apple with charges worth tens of billions of euro.\n\nAs part of its now legally binding commitments, Apple will enable access to NFC in host card emulation (HCE) mode, which lets users complete NFC transactions without relying on an in-device secure element like Apple Pay.\n\nEU competition chief Magrethe Vestager said the commitment opens up competition in \"this crucial sector\" by preventing Apple from excluding other mobile wallets from the iPhone's ecosystem.\n\n\"Today's decision makes Apple's commitments binding,\" Vestager said. \"From now on, competitors will be able to effectively compete with Apple Pay for mobile payments with the iPhone in shops. So consumers will have a wider range of safe and innovative mobile wallets to choose from.\"\n\nVestager and Apple still have issues however, as she recently called out the tech giant's decision to delay the roll-out of certain AI features in the EU as a \"stunning, open declaration\" of the company's attempts to \"disable competition\" in the region.\n\nFind out how emerging tech trends are transforming tomorrow with our new podcast, Future Human: The Series.

This marks the end of a 4-year investigation against the Cupertino giant. Soon, users will have options beyond Apple Pay for mobile wallets.\n\nIn June 2020, the EU launched an investigation against Apple over the terms and conditions for integrating payment services into Apple Pay. A couple of years later (2022), the agency determined that Apple was restricting alternative wallets, limiting innovation and options for users. Basically, only Apple Pay could access the hardware (NFC) and software necessary for mobile payments on the company's devices.\n\nMultiple banks and rival wallet developers have already complained about the situation. After all, they were forced to exclusively use a platform controlled by Apple with no other alternatives. This gave Apple the power to set fees and conditions without other rivals being able to offer something better.\n\nNow, the situation has finally been addressed, as Apple will open its NFC-based mobile payments technology (also called \"tap-and-go\") to wallet rivals. Margrethe Vestager, EU antitrust chief, expressed satisfaction with Apple's move. She said that \"from now on, Apple can no longer use its control over the iPhone ecosystem to keep other mobile wallets out of the market. Competing wallet developers, as well as consumers, will benefit from these changes, opening up innovation and choice, while keeping payments secure.\"\n\nApple's commitment implies that third-party mobile wallets will be able to access the NFC of iPhones without paying licenses. Also to Face ID technology for biometric verification, something key in the authentication of payments. Additionally, Apple will allow users to choose the default mobile wallet on their devices. So, they can even replace Apple Pay entirely if they want.\n\nApple's commitments to the EU will be valid for 10 years. The company has until July 25 to comply, or it will receive a fine of up to 10% of its total annual gross revenue.

That means rivals wanting to create apps or wallets using the tap-to-pay features on iPhones have been unable to do so and users have been forced to use Apple Pay for mobile payments.\n\n\"From now on, Apple can no longer use its control of the iPhone ecosystem to keep (competing) mobile wallets out of the market,\" Vestager said. \"Competing wallet developers as well as consumers will benefit from these changes, opening up innovation and choice while keeping payments secure.\"\n\nThe commitments do not extend to Apple Watches, however. \"Our impression was that the number of people who use Apple Watches for payments is rather small,\" said Vestager, adding that there was \"limited harm done\" from excluding those devices.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hanna_ziady@cnn.com", "name": "Hanna Ziady", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pay", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_wallet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Digital wallet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contactless_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Contactless payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Near-field communication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margrethe_Vestager", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Margrethe Vestager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mobile payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Markets_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital Markets Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Economic Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_ID", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face ID"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Wallet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Wallet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wallet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Handheld_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Handheld Platforms", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap22122395939049.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724076", "eventUri": "eng-9724076", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 1047, "textEnd": 1054}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The European Commission confirmed that Apple's commitments are \"legally binding,\" enabling developers to utilize tap-and-go technology, and access iOS features like Face ID authentication and double-click launch. This agreement saves Apple from a potential antitrust fine that could reach up to 10% of its global annual turnover, roughly $40 billion.\n\nIn addition to NFC access, Apple has agreed to let users set third-party wallets as their default app. Margrethe Vestager, the EU's Executive Vice President (EVP) in charge of competition policy, stated that this move \"opens up competition in this crucial sector,\" preventing Apple from excluding other mobile wallets from the iPhone's ecosystem. She believes it will enable rivals to compete with Apple Pay for mobile payments, offering consumers a wider range of safe and innovative mobile wallets.\n\nThe commitments made by Apple are binding for a decade and will be overseen by an independent entity across the European Economic Area (EEA). The European Commission began its investigation into Apple in 2020, accusing the tech giant of limiting rival mobile wallet developers from accessing necessary technology. In 2024, after the Commission issued a preliminary view that Apple \"abused its dominant position,\" Apple proposed to open up its NFC technology and report to an independent reviewer.\n\nDespite recent agreement, Apple could still face substantial fines in another case where the European Commission issued a preliminary view that the company violated Digital Markets Act (DMA). The new law, effective from March 2024, led to an investigation into whether Apple prevented developers from informing users they could pay less for services elsewhere. Currently, Apple charges a 30% commission on purchases made through its App Store. The European Commission has until March 2025 to make a final ruling.\n\nApple's commitments to the EU include providing third parties with additional features and functionality, like defaulting of preferred payment apps, and access to authentication features such as Face ID. The tech giant also pledged to apply Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms when deciding whether to offer access to NFC.

This marks a rare compliance move by Apple, which has previously contested EU regulatory actions.\n\nIn addition to opening NFC access for mobile payments, Apple's offer includes provisions for developers to enable tap-and-go payments for various applications beyond traditional payments, such as car keys, transit passes, and loyalty programs directly within iOS apps.\n\nThe EU had accused Apple of impeding competition by limiting NFC access to its own Apple Pay system, leading to the charges two years ago. Apple's proactive settlement offer in January aimed to resolve the case without fines or admitting wrongdoing.\n\nEarlier this year, Apple incurred its first EU antitrust penalty, amounting to \u20ac1.84 billion (US$2 billion), for restricting competition in its App Store. This decision underscored ongoing regulatory challenges for the tech industry giant in Europe.", "source": {"uri": "newsghana.com.gh", "dataType": "news", "title": "News Ghana"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Near-field communication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pay", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_wallet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital wallet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contactless_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contactless payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margrethe_Vestager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Margrethe Vestager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Markets_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital Markets Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_(iOS/iPadOS)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "App Store (iOS/iPadOS)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loyalty program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Merchant_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Merchant Services", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://newsghana.com.gh/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/apple-1111-640x360.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724076", "eventUri": "eng-9724076", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

This technology, crucial for mobile wallet functionality, was previously reserved exclusively for Apple Pay.\n\nIn its preliminary findings, the Commission concluded that \"Apple abused its dominant position by refusing to supply the NFC input on iOS to competing mobile wallet developers, while reserving such access only to Apple Pay\". This behaviour, the Commission argued, \"excluded Apple Pay's rivals from the market and led to less innovation and choice for iPhone mobile wallets users\".\n\nTo address these concerns, Apple has committed to several key changes. These include allowing third-party wallet providers free access to the NFC input on iOS devices without requiring the use of Apple Pay or Apple Wallet, implementing a fair and non-discriminatory procedure for granting NFC access to third-party developers, enabling users to easily set a third-party payment app as their default for in-store payments, and establishing an independent review mechanism for Apple's decisions on access restrictions.\n\nFollowing a market test of these initial commitments, Apple further agreed to additional measures. The company will extend the possibility for payments with third-party apps at other industry-certified terminals, remove the requirement for developers to have a Payment Service Provider licence, and allow NFC access for developers to pre-build payment apps for third-party mobile wallet providers.\n\nEU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager commented on the agreement, stating, \"From now on, competitors will be able to effectively compete with Apple Pay for mobile payments with the iPhone in shops. So consumers will have a wider range of safe and innovative mobile wallets to choose from\".\n\nThese commitments, which will be valid for 10 years, apply to all third-party mobile app developers established in the European Economic Area and to all iOS users with an Apple ID registered in the EEA.\n\nThis settlement marks a significant shift in Apple's approach to EU antitrust scrutiny, as the company has typically resisted such investigations.

Today's decision makes Apple's commitments binding,\" EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.\n\n\"From now on, competitors will be able to effectively compete with Apple Pay for mobile payments with the iPhone in shops. So consumers will have a wider range of safe and innovative mobile wallets to choose from,\" she said.\n\nThe EU previously found that Apple enjoyed a dominant position by restricting access to \"tap-as-you-go\" chips or near-field communication (NFC), which allows devices to interconnect within a very short range, to favour its own system.\n\nNow competitors will have access to the standard technology behind contactless payments to offer alternative tap-to-pay tools to iPhone users in the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the EU but also Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.\n\nOnly customers with an Apple ID registered in the EEA would be able to make use of these outside apps, the European Commission said in a statement.\n\nThe changes must remain in force for 10 years and a \"monitoring trustee\" must be chosen by Apple to report to the commission during that period on their implementation.\n\nApple had risked a fine of up to 10 percent of its total worldwide annual turnover. Apple's total revenue in the year to September 2023 stood at $383 billion.\n\n\"Apple Pay and Apple Wallet will continue to be available in the EEA for users and developers, and will continue to provide an easy, secure and private way to pay, as well as present passes seamlessly from Apple Wallet,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nThe probe's conclusion comes at a particularly difficult moment in relations between the EU and Apple, especially over the bloc's new competition rules for big tech.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act (DMA) seeks to ensure tech titans do not privilege their own services over rivals, but the iPhone maker says it puts users' privacy at risk.\n\nEU, Apple at loggerheads\n\nOne of the DMA's main objectives is to give consumers more choice in the web browsers, app marketplaces, search engines and other digital services they use.\n\nThe EU in June accused Apple of breaching the DMA by preventing developers from freely pointing consumers to alternative channels for offers and content outside of its proprietary App Store.\n\nIt also kickstarted another probe under the DMA into Apple's new fees for app developers.\n\nThe company could face heavy fines if the DMA violations are confirmed.\n\nIn March, the EU slapped a 1.8-billion-euro ($1.9 billion) fine on Apple in a different antitrust case but the company has appealed the penalty in an EU court.\n\nBrussels also forced Apple last year to scrap its Lightning port on new iPhone models, in a change that was introduced worldwide and not just in Europe.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com",

Apple agreed to open it up to rivals within the EU, but it has taken some months for the regulators to accept the details.\n\nThe EU says that the time was spent testing Apple's commitments, and consulting with rivals over them.

This means that the iPhone maker will avoid the threat of fines by allowing rival wallet developers to use contactless mobile payments technology of Apple Pay for 10 years.\n\n\"The Commission has decided to accept commitments offered by Apple.These commitments address our preliminary concerns that Apple may have illegally restricted competition for mobile wallets on iPhones,\" said European Commission EVP Margrethe Vestager, who heads up the EU's competition division.\n\n\"Apple has until July 25 to implement their commitments. As of this date, developers will be able to offer a mobile wallet on the iPhone with the same 'tap and go' experience that so far has been reserved for Apple Pay,\" she added.\n\nWhat's the Apple Pay investigation all about\n\nIn 2020, the EU launched an antitrust investigation, looking at the terms and conditions Apple sets for integrating Apple Pay in apps and websites. The probe concerned the 'tap and go' technology that uses Near-Field Communication (NFC) and alleged refusals of accessing Apple Pay.\n\nThen in 2022, the EU Commission raised concerns that Apple Pay's dominance on iPhones effectively excluded other mobile wallet providers, thereby restricting competition.\n\n\"Our preliminary finding was therefore that Apple abused its dominant position by refusing to supply the NFC technology to competing mobile wallet developers,\" the Commission mentioned.\n\nIn the settlement, the EU accepted commitments offered by Apple over how it operates Apple Pay to end a long-running competition investigation. This means that iPhone users in the region will be able to use their preferred mobile wallet for payments in stores.\n\n\"They will be able to do so while enjoying all the iPhone's functionalities, including tap-and-go, Double-Click and FaceID,\" the Commission added.\n\nMeanwhile, Vestager said the iPhone maker has yet to change its business practices to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which requires Big Tech to ensure a level playing field for rivals and give users more choice.\n\nThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Apple will let users set a third-party wallet app as their default, rather than its own Apple Wallet. It will also allow rivals full access to key iOS features, such as double click to launch wallet apps, along with Face ID, Touch ID, and passcodes for authentication. From the EU press release:\n\nThe commitments bring important changes to how Apple operates in Europe to the benefit of competitors and customers.\n\nFirst, Apple commits to give access to NFC functionality to third-party mobile wallets. This access will be free of charge.\n\nIt will take place in what is called \"Host Card Emulation mode\". This is a software solution that allows rival wallets to make secure NFC payments. Apple Pay, on the other hand, relies on access to the hardware \"secure element\" in the iPhone. We accept Apple's commitment because it offers an equivalent solution in terms of security and user experience. And it is easier to implement both for Apple and wallet developers. Indeed, other wallets already use this solution in an Android environment.\n\nSecond, Apple committed to enable access to important functionalities available on iPhones. This includes Double-Click and Face ID. iPhone users will be able to double-click the side button of their iPhones to launch their preferred payment application. Competing wallets will also be able to use Face ID, Touch ID and passcode to verify users' identities.\n\nThird, Apple will also enable users to make the wallet of their choice the standard option on their iPhones. This is also known as setting the default option.\n\nThese commitments are applicable to users registered in the European Economic Area, including when they travel abroad.\n\nAnd Apple will not prevent developers from combining NFC payments with other use cases, for instance transit cards, access control, concert tickets, digital identity credentials. Everything that you could have in a wallet.\n\nApple has until July 25 to implement the changes. The company risks a fine if it violates the agreement, which will remain binding for 10 years.\n\nThe European Commission charged Apple in 2022 with violating competition law, contending that Apple was preventing competitors from accessing its near-field communication (NFC) technology to favor Apple Pay. In response to the charges, Apple made a commitment to the European Commission in January to open access to the iPhone's NFC, allowing competitors to create their own contactless payment solutions outside of the confines of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet.\n\nThe settlement means Apple will avoid a potential fine by the EU that could have been as high as 10% of the company's global annual revenue. Given Apple's reported revenue of $383 billion in 2023, the fine could have amounted to approximately $40 billion.", "source": {"uri": "macrumors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MacRumors"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_hardwick@macrumors.com", "name": "Tim Hardwick", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Near-field communication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_ID", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Face ID"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wallet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_ID", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touch ID"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Authentication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Payment system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Wallet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Wallet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_wallet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital wallet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "User experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Password"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Access control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contactless_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contactless payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Economic Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/RISC_OS", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/RISC OS", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images.macrumors.com/t/VMWaZYQyQr5u14pdxbF2A5KZ6YM=/1600x/article-new/2022/04/apple-card-via-apple-pay.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724076", "eventUri": "eng-9724076", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 2276, "textEnd": 2283}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Today's decision makes Apple's commitments binding,\" EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.\n\n\"From now on, competitors will be able to effectively compete with Apple Pay for mobile payments with the iPhone in shops. So consumers will have a wider range of safe and innovative mobile wallets to choose from,\" she said.\n\nThe EU previously found that Apple enjoyed a dominant position by restricting access to \"tap-as-you-go\" chips or near-field communication (NFC), which allows devices to interconnect within a very short range, to favour its own system.\n\nNow competitors will have access to the standard technology behind contactless payments to offer alternative tap-to-pay tools to iPhone users in the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the EU but also Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.\n\nOnly customers with an Apple ID registered in the EEA would be able to make use of these outside apps, the European Commission said in a statement.\n\nThe changes must remain in force for 10 years and a \"monitoring trustee\" must be chosen by Apple to report to the commission during that period on their implementation.\n\nApple had risked a fine of up to 10 percent of its total worldwide annual turnover. Apple's total revenue in the year to September 2023 stood at $383 billion.\n\n\"Apple Pay and Apple Wallet will continue to be available in the EEA for users and developers, and will continue to

rules for big tech.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act (DMA) seeks to ensure tech titans do not privilege their own services over rivals, but the iPhone maker says it puts users' privacy at risk.\n\n- EU, Apple at loggerheads -\n\nOne of the DMA's main objectives is to give consumers more choice in the web browsers, app marketplaces, search engines and other digital services they use.\n\nThe EU in June accused Apple of breaching the DMA by preventing developers from freely pointing consumers to alternative channels for offers and content outside of its proprietary App Store.\n\nIt also kickstarted another probe under the DMA into Apple's new fees for app developers.\n\nThe company could face heavy fines if the DMA violations are confirmed.\n\nIn March, the EU slapped a 1.8-billion-euro ($1.9 billion) fine on Apple in a different antitrust case but the company has appealed the penalty in an EU court.\n\nBrussels also forced Apple last year to scrap its Lightning port on new iPhone models, in a change that was introduced worldwide and not just in Europe.\n\nraz/ec/rl", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Today's decision makes Apple's commitments binding,\" EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.\n\n\"From now on, competitors will be able to effectively compete with Apple Pay for mobile payments with the iPhone in shops. So consumers will have a wider range of safe and innovative mobile wallets to choose from,\" she said.\n\nThe EU previously found that Apple enjoyed a dominant position by restricting access to \"tap-as-you-go\" chips or near-field communication (NFC), which allows devices to interconnect within a very short range, to favour its own system.\n\nNow competitors will have access to the standard technology behind contactless payments to offer alternative tap-to-pay tools to iPhone users in the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the EU but also Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.\n\nOnly customers with an Apple ID registered in the EEA would be able to make use of these outside apps, the European Commission said in a statement.\n\nThe changes must remain in force for 10 years and a \"monitoring trustee\" must be chosen by Apple to report to the commission during that period on their implementation.\n\nApple had risked a fine of up to 10 per cent of its total worldwide annual turnover. Apple's total revenue in the year to September 2023 stood at $383 billion.\n\n\"Apple Pay and Apple Wallet will continue to be available in the EEA for users and developers, and will continue to provide an easy, secure and private way to pay, as well as present passes seamlessly from Apple Wallet,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nThe probe's conclusion comes at a particularly difficult moment in relations between the EU and Apple, especially over the bloc's new competition rules for big tech.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act (DMA) seeks to ensure tech titans do not privilege their own services over rivals, but the iPhone maker says it puts users' privacy at risk.\n\nEU, Apple at loggerheads\n\nOne of the DMA's main objectives is to give consumers more choice in the web browsers, app marketplaces, search engines and other digital services they use.\n\nThe EU in June accused Apple of breaching the DMA by preventing developers from freely pointing consumers to alternative channels for offers and content outside of its proprietary App Store.\n\nIt also kickstarted another probe under the DMA into Apple's new fees for app developers.\n\nThe company could face heavy fines if the DMA violations are confirmed.\n\nIn March, the EU slapped a 1.8-billion-euro ($1.9 billion) fine on Apple in a different antitrust case but the company has appealed the penalty in an EU court.\n\nBrussels also forced Apple last year to scrap its Lightning port on new iPhone models, in a change that was introduced worldwide and not just in Europe.\n\nMore From Companies Neuralink eyes

Today's decision makes Apple's commitments binding,\" EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.\n\n\"From now on, competitors will be able to effectively compete with Apple Pay for mobile payments with the iPhone in shops. So consumers will have a wider range of safe and innovative mobile wallets to choose from,\" she said.\n\nThe EU previously found that Apple enjoyed a dominant position by restricting access to \"tap-as-you-go\" chips or near-field communication (NFC), which allows devices to interconnect within a very short range, to favour its own system.\n\nNow competitors will have access to the standard technology behind contactless payments to offer alternative tap-to-pay tools to iPhone users in the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the EU but also Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.\n\nOnly customers with an Apple ID registered in the EEA would be able to make use of these outside apps, the European Commission said in a statement.\n\nThe changes must remain in force for 10 years and a \"monitoring trustee\" must be chosen by Apple to report to the commission during that period on their implementation.\n\nApple had risked a fine of up to 10 percent of its total worldwide annual turnover. Apple's total revenue in the year to September 2023 stood at $383 billion.\n\n\"Apple Pay and Apple Wallet will continue to be available in the EEA for users and developers, and will continue to provide an easy, secure and private way to pay, as well as present passes seamlessly from Apple Wallet,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nThe probe's conclusion comes at a particularly difficult moment in relations between the EU and Apple, especially over the bloc's new competition rules for big tech.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act (DMA) seeks to ensure tech titans do not privilege their own services over rivals, but the iPhone maker says it puts users' privacy at risk.\n\n- EU, Apple at loggerheads -\n\nOne of the DMA's main objectives is to give consumers more choice in the web browsers, app marketplaces, search engines and other digital services they use.\n\nThe EU in June accused Apple of breaching the DMA by preventing developers from freely pointing consumers to alternative channels for offers and content outside of its proprietary App Store.\n\nIt also kickstarted another probe under the DMA into Apple's new fees for app developers.\n\nThe company could face heavy fines if the DMA violations are confirmed.\n\nIn March, the EU slapped a 1.8-billion-euro ($1.9 billion) fine on Apple in a different antitrust case but the company has appealed the penalty in an EU court.\n\nBrussels also forced Apple last year to scrap its Lightning port on new iPhone models, in a change that was introduced worldwide and not just in Europe.\n\nraz/ec/rl\n\nMore from this

The European Commission announced Apple made \"legally binding\" commitments to provide developers with their Near-Field Communication (NFC) technology, which is used for tap-and-go technology, and access iOS features like Face ID authentication and double-click to launch. The agreement saves Apple from facing an antitrust fine equal to up to 10 percent of its worldwide annual turnover -- about $40 billion.\n\nApple has also agreed to stipulations such as allowing users to make third-party wallets their default app. \"It opens up competition in this crucial sector, by preventing Apple from excluding other mobile wallets from the iPhone's ecosystem,\" Margrethe Vestage, the EU's executive vice president in charge of competition policy, stated in the release. \"From now on, competitors will be able to effectively compete with Apple Pay for mobile payments with the iPhone in shops. So consumers will have a wider range of safe and innovative mobile wallets to choose from.\" The commitments are binding for ten years, with an independent monitor ensuring Apple follows them across the European Economic Area (EEA).\n\nThe European Commission opened its investigation into Apple in 2020, alleging that Apple was restricting rival mobile wallet developers from accessing necessary technology. Two years later, the regulatory body issued a preliminary view that Apple \"abused its dominant position.\"\n\nThen, in early 2024, Apple finally offered to open up its NFC technology and report to an independent reviewer. The European Commission shared the terms publicly, encouraging Apple's rivals and other interested parties to give their opinion. The final agreement between the European Commission and Apple results from those consultations.\n\nThe tech giant could still be on the hook for tens of billions of dollars in a different case after the European Commission issued its preliminary view that Apple violated the Digital Markets Act (DMA).

The move marks a brief truce between the two after a number of antitrust accusations from European regulators.\n\n\"Today's decision makes Apple's commitments binding,\" said Margrethe Vestager, the executive in charge of enforcing EU competition rules, on Thursday. \"It opens up competition in this crucial sector, by preventing Apple from excluding other mobile wallets from the iPhone's ecosystem.\"\n\nThe tech group's rivals will be able to \"effectively compete\" with Apple Pay for mobile payments with the iPhone in shops, she added, giving consumers a \"wider range of safe and innovative mobile wallets to choose from\".\n\nHundreds of millions of iPhones use Apple Pay and the end of this long-running probe comes at a time when regulators in the EU and the US are stepping up their scrutiny of the company's corporate practices.\n\nThe EU accused Apple in 2022, after two years of investigation, of breaking competition law by blocking rivals' access to its technology to favour its own payment system.\n\nOfficials have been testing concessions by Apple since January that include giving developers free access to its NFC technology on iOS devices with no need to use Apple Wallet or Apple Pay. The Financial Times last month reported on an imminent settlement of the case.\n\nSanctions from the EU for anticompetitive practices would have included a fine of up to 10 per cent of the group's total worldwide annual turnover. In 2023 Apple's revenues of $383bn would have meant a fine of roughly $40bn though regulators rarely impose the highest penalty and fines tend to get reduced in court after appeal.\n\nApple recently became the first company to face charges under the EU's Digital Markets Act, tough legislation aimed at improving consumer choice and opening digital markets in Europe.\n\nIt was also recently fined a record \u20ac1.8bn over anticompetitive practices related to music streaming services. Apple has taken the EU to court and appealed against the penalty. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2024", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pay", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Near-field communication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Wallet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Wallet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_wallet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital wallet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contactless_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contactless payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margrethe_Vestager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Margrethe Vestager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Markets_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital Markets Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Payment system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/3LPVXNWOGJFNBDFMROVXCF7TLA.jpg?smart=true&auth=e2967b20e9949cb4940fac12c87278f1c914d80be976fe09739d4f48c43ac4af&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724076", "eventUri": "eng-9724076", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

One major concern was that Apple restricted access to Near-Field Communication (NFC) tech to its own Apple Pay solution at the expense of third-party alternatives.\n\nDuring the investigation, the EC made the preliminary conclusion that Apple was indeed abusing its position to keep rivals at bay.\n\nEarlier this year, Apple announced some major changes to its mobile operating system, which included developer access to NFC hardware for contactless payments. It also offered a commitment to allow a third-party payment app to be set as default by users as well as \"a monitoring mechanism and separate dispute settlement system to allow for independent review of Apple's decisions restricting access.\"\n\nThe EC market tested the suggestions and, after some consultation, Apple tweaked its proposal to make it easier for developers to prompt users to change their default payment app and removed the requirement for developers to have a license as a Payment Service Provider (PSP) or a binding agreement with a PSP to access the NFC input.\n\nOther modifications to the proposal included shortening deadlines for resolving disputes.\n\nThe EC concluded that Apple's final commitments were good enough - at least in terms of addressing this particular area of competition concern - and has elected to make them legally binding under EU antitrust rules.\n\nAccording to the EC: \"If the company concerned does not honor such commitments, the Commission may impose a fine of up to 10 percent of its total annual turnover, without having to find an infringement of EU antitrust rules, or a periodic penalty payment of 5 percent per day of its daily turnover for every day of non-compliance.\"\n\nMargrethe Vestager, Executive Vice-President in charge of competition policy, said of the decision: \"It opens up competition in this crucial sector, by preventing Apple from excluding other mobile wallets from the iPhone's ecosystem.\n\n\"From now on, competitors will be able to effectively compete with Apple Pay for mobile payments with the iPhone in shops. So consumers will have a wider range of safe and innovative mobile wallets to choose from.\"\n\nThe commitments, which apply to developers and users in the European Economic Area (EEA) will remain in force for ten years.\n\nThe Register contacted Apple for its take on the decision.

The EU Commission said that it has accepted the set of remedies Apple offered to the Commission earlier this year, which will allow other mobile wallet developers in the EU to access the iPhone's NFC-based tap-to-pay technology.\n\nThe EU Commission first sent a Statement of Objections to Apple regarding its mobile wallet solution back in May 2022. At the time, the Commission pointed out that iPhone users could only use their device's 'tap and go' function with Apple Pay, as other mobile wallets couldn't access the iPhone's NFC chip. In its preliminary findings, the EU regulator pointed out that Apple's tight control over contactless payments on the iPhone was illegal under EU competition rules and damaging competition in the region.\n\nApple previously used the security argument to protect its walled garden, as it did with its App Store until the Digital Markets Act forced the company to allow alternative app marketplaces and app sideloading in the EU. Well, as the DMA also requires companies designated as \"gatekeepers\" to open up access to NFC technology for mobile payments, Apple couldn't really refuse to change to how contactless payments work on the iPhone.\n\nHere are the three remedies Apple offered to the EU Commission:\n\n\"Thanks to these commitments, iPhone users will be able to use their preferred mobile wallet for payments in stores.

The Commission found that Apple was abusing its dominant position in the mobile wallet market on iOS. Apple restricted the NFC capability in iPhones to the Apple Pay mobile wallet, thereby preventing other payment providers from offering contactless payments similar to Apple Pay. Responding to the concerns raised by the Commission, Apple made the following commitments in January 2024.\n\nTo address the Commission's competition concerns, Apple initially offered the following commitments:\n\nTo allow third-party wallet providers access to the NFC input on iOS devices free of charge, without having to use Apple Pay or Apple Wallet. Apple will enable access to NFC in Host Card Emulation mode ('HCE'). HCE allows to securely store payment credentials and complete transactions using NFC, without relying on an in-device secure element. To apply a fair, objective, transparent and non-discriminatory procedure and eligibility criteria to grant NFC access to third-party mobile wallet app developers. To enable users to easily set an HCE payment app as their default app for payments in stores and to use relevant functionalities such as Field Detect (which opens the user's default payment app when a locked iPhone is presented to an NFC reader), Double-click (which launches the default payment app when double clicking the phone's side or home button), and authentication tools such as Touch ID, Face ID, and device passcode. To establish a monitoring mechanism and separate dispute settlement system to allow for independent review of Apple's decisions restricting access. To apply the abovementioned commitments to all third-party mobile app developers established in the European Economic Area ('EEA') and to all iOS users with an Apple ID registered in the EEA, also while traveling temporarily outside the EEA.\n\nThe Commission had a discussion with all interested third parties to verify whether Apple's commitments remove all of the competition concerns. Based on the feedback, Apple has now changed its initial proposal and committed the following:\n\nTo extend the possibility to initiate payments with HCE payment apps at other industry-certified terminals, such as merchant phones or devices used as terminal (so called SoftPOS), if this is enabled. To explicitly acknowledge that HCE developers are not prevented from combining the HCE payment function with other NFC functionalities or use cases. To remove the requirement for developers to have a licence as a Payment Service Provider ('PSP') or a binding agreement with a PSP to access the NFC input. To allow NFC access for developers to pre-build payment apps for third party mobile wallet providers. To update the HCE architecture to comply with evolving industry standards used by Apple Pay, and to continue to update standards even if they are no longer implemented by Apple Pay, under certain conditions. To enable developers to prompt users to easily set up their default payment app and redirect users to the default NFC settings page, enabling defaulting with only a few clicks. To comply with the same industry standard-specifications as developers of HCE payment apps and to protect confidential information obtained in the context of an audit. To shorten deadlines for resolving disputes. Moreover, Apple offered additional independence and procedural guarantees for the monitoring trustee.\n\nFollowing the above final commitments, the Commission has decided to make them legally binding on Apple. So, Apple will have to follow the above commitments for 10 years throughout the EEA. The implementation of these commitments will be monitored by a monitoring trustee.\n\nMargrethe Vestager, Executive Vice-President in charge of competition policy, said the following regarding Apple's commitment.\n\nIt is safe and convenient to pay with your phone. Apple has committed to allow rivals to access the 'tap and go' technology of iPhones. Today's decision makes Apple' commitments binding. It opens up competition in this crucial sector, by preventing Apple from excluding other mobile wallets from the iPhone's ecosystem. From now on, competitors will be able to effectively compete with Apple Pay for mobile payments with the iPhone in shops. So consumers will have a wider range of safe and innovative mobile wallets to choose from.\n\nSource: EC", "source": {"uri": "neowin.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Neowin"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pradeep_viswanathan@neowin.net", "name": "Pradeep Viswanathan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Near-field communication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pay", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_wallet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Digital wallet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Economic Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_iPhone_models", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of iPhone models"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Wallet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Wallet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emulator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contactless_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contactless payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_ID", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face ID"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_ID", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple ID"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation Portable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_ID", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touch ID"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Authentication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Password"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margrethe_Vestager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Margrethe Vestager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Confidentiality"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2024/07/1720691929_apple_pay_nfc_eu_story.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724076", "eventUri": "eng-9724076", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The days of the iPhone's NFC capabilities being limited to just Apple Pay are at an end. In Europe, anyway.\n\nBut in the rest of the world, it's Apple Pay or nothing.\n\niPhone owners can use Apple Pay to make a transaction at a store or restaurant point-of-sale machine. The connection between the two devices happens over NFC (Near Field Communications), and the \"tap and go\" process very convenient, especially as many shoppers and businesses move away from cash. But don't try that same trick with PayPal -- Apple doesn't allow it.\n\nThe EU formally objected to this policy in 2022, stating that it \"stifled innovation and prevented competition in the mobile wallet market.\" But on Thursday, Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's commissioner for competition, announced that the EC is satisfied with the changes Apple made to the iPhone to address the commission's concerns.\n\nUnder an agreement, Apple commits to giving third-party mobile wallets access to the iPhone's NFC functionality for ten years. And the agreement goes beyond that.\n\nThird-party wallets can be made the standard option on a user's iPhone. They can be set up so that double pressing the side button on the handset opens the rival wallet, not Apple Pay. And these applications have access to Face ID for securing access.\n\nApple has until July 25 to make all these changes, according to Vestager.

Apple devices use Apple Pay for NFC payments by default.\n\nThis gives Apple a dominant position in the mobile wallet market on iOS. The company has not allowed third-party developers to access NFC components, which the Commission found to be an abuse of its dominant position under the DMA, according to Thursday's press release.\n\nThe EU executive shared Apple's commitments to address the competition concerns in January.\n\nIf the company fails to honour the now-legally binding commitments, the Commission may impose a fine of up to 10% of its annual turnover or a daily penalty of 5% of its daily turnover for non-compliance.\n\nThe Commission said Apple's updated commitments include allowing third-party wallet providers free access to NFC technology on iOS devices via Host Card Emulation (HCE), which securely stores payment credentials for transactions.n\n\n\"Apple Pay and Apple Wallet will continue to be available in the European Economic Area (EEA) for users and developers,\" an Apple representative told Euractiv following the announcement.\n\nBetween 19 January and 19 February, the Commission tested Apple's commitments and consulted third parties, seeking feedback based on which the company updated its previous commitments, the EU executive said.\n\n\"Many banks, app developers, card issuers, and financial associations gave us their feedback,\" Margrethe Vestager, executive vice president and commissioner for competition at the Commission, said during a Thursday briefing.\n\nThe tech giant committed to a fair and transparent process for granting NFC access, allowing users to easily set HCE payment apps as defaults and use related features like Field Detect and authentication tools.\n\nApple also set up a system to oversee compliance with its NFC access commitments across the EEA and resolve any disputes.\n\nThe company broadened NFC payment options to include certified terminals, enabled developers to integrate NFC functions freely without licenses, simplified setting default payment apps, and enhanced dispute resolution with improved monitoring.\n\nBecause of its key position, Apple is designated as a gatekeeper under the EU's digital competition regulation, the Digital Markets Act (DMA).\n\nThe DMA, among other things, mandates that gatekeepers allow interoperability with their hardware and software, including NFC technology, the decision also addresses these practices, Vestager said on Thursday.\n\nShe noted that monitoring and dispute resolution mechanisms, which Apple also committed to, are, however, \"more than what is required by the DMA.\"", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurActiv.com"}, "authors": [],

The EU earlier warned that restricting access to the technology amounted to an abuse of its market power.\n\n\"Apple has committed to allow rivals to access the 'tap and go' technology of iPhones,\" the EU's competition chief Margrethe Vestager said. The decision will prevent Apple \"from excluding other mobile wallets from the iPhone's ecosystem.\"\n\nUnder the EU settlement, consumers in Europe will be able to use alternative digital wallets to pay for goods and services at checkouts. The commitments remain binding for 10 years and Apple risks a fine of as much as 10% of global annual revenue if it violates the agreement.\n\nThe closing of the investigation marks a brief respite between the EU and Apple, which have long been at loggerheads over how the Cupertino, California-based firm toes the regulatory line in Brussels.\n\nEarlier this year, the company challenged a \u20ac1.8 billion EU fine it was hit with for thwarting fair competition from music-streaming rivals, including Spotify Technology. This fine came after it was previously handed a record \u20ac13 billion tax bill in a dispute with EU regulators over Irish state aid.\n\nThe firm has also been forced to overhaul its iOS, Safari and App Store offerings in the EU in order to step in line with the bloc's Digital Markets Act - a regulation against which it has filed a raft of legal challenges.\n\nApple's digital wallet allows consumers to store virtual debit and credit cards on iPhones, as well as ticket bookings. Its offer to the EU would allow third-party developers access to Apple's payment technology in order to help them create alternative mobile wallets, the commission said Thursday.\n\nIn response to the settlement, Apple said it is rolling out access to its payments chip in Europe while also allowing contactless transactions for car and home keys, corporate badges, loyalty cards, and event tickets.\n\nSince its debut a decade ago, Apple Pay has grown to become the most dominant and widely used digital wallets on the market. Across Europe, consumers now turn to the app to quickly tap and pay for everything from public transportation to groceries to restaurant bills.\n\nThis new commitment, then, could spark a seismic change for the payments industry, which has long craved the ability to use Apple's near field communications technology in their own digital wallets.\n\nWith the new access, players like PayPal, Alphabet's Google Pay or Samsung's Samsung Pay might be able to better compete and entice more European customers to use their apps instead of Apple when checking out in stores.\n\nShould the commitment extends to the US -

It currently faces three investigations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) over its business practices.\n\nThe European Commission, which acts as the EU antitrust enforcer, said Apple's offer would be valid for 10 years.

It will now allow developers to access its NFC to pre-build payment apps for rival mobile vallet providers.\n\nApple said its offer would give European developers an option to enable tap-and-go payments for car keys, closed loop transit, corporate badges, home keys, hotel keys, merchant loyalty/rewards, and event tickets from within their iOS apps.\n\nThe EU competition enforcer had two years ago charged Apple with hindering competition for its Apple Pay mobile wallet by blocking rival app developers from accessing its tap-and-go technology.\n\nThe company in January offered to settle the case that would stave off a fine and a finding of wrongdoing.\n\nApple was slapped with a 1.84 billion-euro fine in March, its first EU antitrust penalty, for thwarting competition from Spotify (SPOT.N)New Tab, opens new tab and other music streaming rivals via restrictions on its App Store.\n\n(This story has been refiled to fix a typo in the headline)\n\nReporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Arun Koyyur\n\nFoo Yun Chee\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nAn agenda-setting and market-moving journalist, Foo Yun Chee is a 20-year veteran at Reuters.

Today's decision makes Apple's commitments binding,\" EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.\n\n\"From now on, competitors will be able to effectively compete with Apple Pay for mobile payments with the iPhone in shops. So consumers will have a wider range of safe and innovative mobile wallets to choose from,\" she said.\n\nThe EU previously found that Apple enjoyed a dominant position by restricting access to \"tap-as-you-go\" chips or near-field communication (NFC), which allows devices to interconnect within a very short range, to favour its own system.\n\nNow competitors will have access to the standard technology behind contactless payments to offer alternative tap-to-pay tools to iPhone users in the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the EU but also Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.\n\nOnly customers with an Apple ID registered in the EEA would be able to make use of these outside apps, the European Commission said in a statement.\n\nThe changes must remain in force for 10 years and a \"monitoring trustee\" must be chosen by Apple to report to the commission during that period on their implementation.\n\nApple had risked a fine of up to 10 percent of its total worldwide annual turnover. Apple's total revenue in the year to September 2023 stood at $383 billion.\n\n\"Apple Pay and Apple Wallet will continue to be available in the EEA for users and developers, and will continue to provide an easy, secure and private way to pay, as well as present passes seamlessly from Apple Wallet,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nThe probe's conclusion comes at a particularly difficult moment in relations between the EU and Apple, especially over the bloc's new competition rules for big tech.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act (DMA) seeks to ensure tech titans do not privilege their own services over rivals, but the iPhone maker says it puts users' privacy at risk.\n\nOne of the DMA's main objectives is to give consumers more choice in the web browsers, app marketplaces, search engines and other digital services they use.\n\nThe EU in June accused Apple of breaching the DMA by preventing developers from freely pointing consumers to alternative channels for offers and content outside of its proprietary App Store.\n\nIt also kickstarted another probe under the DMA into Apple's new fees for app developers.\n\nThe company could face heavy fines if the DMA violations are confirmed.\n\nIn March, the EU slapped a 1.8-billion-euro ($1.9 billion) fine on Apple in a different antitrust case but the company has appealed the penalty in an EU court.\n\nBrussels also forced Apple last year to scrap its Lightning port on new iPhone models, in a change that was introduced worldwide and not just in Europe.", "source": {"uri": "legit.ng", "dataType": "news", "title":

Case by Opening Its Payment Service to Rivals", "body": "Apple will for the first time allow banks, payment services and other app developers to use the underlying technology behind Apple Pay to make rival tap-and-go payment services, settling a long-running European Union antitrust investigation, regulators said on Thursday.\n\nThe agreement applies only in the European Union, where consumers could see an influx of new apps and services to make payments on the go. Apple has until now refused to grant rivals access to the payment technology on iPhones, known as near field communication, essentially forcing people to use Apple Pay.\n\n\"Apple has committed to allow rivals to access the 'tap and go' technology of iPhones,\" Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission's executive vice president, who oversees competition policy, said in a statement. \"It opens up competition in this crucial sector, by preventing Apple from excluding other mobile wallets from the iPhone's ecosystem.\"\n\nThe settlement stems from an investigation started in 2020 to determine if Apple was abusing its dominant position in the smartphone market to box out rival payment service providers. The announcement on Thursday does not apply to Apple Watch, which also has tap-and-go payment technology, an E.U. spokeswoman said.\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nApple's policy shift shows how tech regulation in the European Union has resulted in notable product changes for products and services used every day by consumers. Earlier this year, Apple agreed to give iPhone and iPad users access to rival app stores for the first time to comply with new competition rules. Google has also changed how it displays certain search results in the European Union, while Meta introduced a new ad-free subscription service for Facebook and Instagram users in the region.\n\nThe changes are part of a broad shift in the global technology industry as a result of government policies. Products and services that were once available globally as the same offerings no matter where a person lived are now being altered or removed from certain markets as a result of regulations. For example, Apple said it would not release its latest artificial intelligence service in the European Union because of regulatory uncertainty, and TikTok is legally barred from India.\n\nIn Europe, the regulatory scrutiny is only expected to intensify. Apple was recently charged in another case with violating E.U. competition laws for its policies related to the App Store. The company is also appealing a 1.8 billion euro fine for thwarting competition in the music streaming market. Google, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok are also under E.U. investigation.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_service_provider", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Payment service provider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pay", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Pay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Near-field communication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margrethe_Vestager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Margrethe Vestager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_wallet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital wallet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_(iOS/iPadOS)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "App Store (iOS/iPadOS)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "App store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription_business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subscription business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/11/multimedia/11EU-APPLE-hvpt/11EU-APPLE-hvpt-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724076", "eventUri": "eng-9724076", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

This includes allowing banking and alternative wallets apps to present themselves when the phone is held near a NFC terminal, or when the user double-clicks the side button.\n\nFollowing some amendments, the EU has finally announced today that it is satisfied with these concessions, and is closing a four-year investigation into Apple's alleged anti-competitive practices regarding Apple Pay.\n\nAt least in theory, the new API access to enable other apps to become the default wallet app on the device will mean the system Apple Pay option will have to compete on merits. Other banks and payment companies could now release alternative wallet apps in the EU, and fight for marketshare without being at a feature disadvantage.\n\nAs part of the additional commitments, Apple has agreed to remove the requirement for developers to have a license as a Payment Server Provider, in order to be granted the HCE Payments Entitlement. It will also commit to evolving HCE support as industry standards evolve, even in directions that Apple Pay itself may not necessarily implement.\n\nAccess to the entitlement remains limited to developers operating in the European Economic Area. It seems likely that governments in other regions will pressure Apple to offer the same capabilities in other countries, over time.\n\nThis is just one of many competition investigations undertaken by the EU against Apple in recent years. The music streaming case was concluded earlier this year, with Apple being slapped with a $2bn fine. Apple is appealing that decision.\n\nThe fight regarding the opening up of iOS to third-party app distribution also continues, under the umbrella of the Digital Markets Act. In June, the EU said Apple's anti-steering rules were in breach of the DMA and it is also investigating other parts of the alternative business terms like the Core Technology Fee, and the complexity of the multi-step user flow required to install a third party App store on the phone.

The EU earlier warned that restricting access to the technology amounted to an abuse of its market power.\n\n\"Apple has committed to allow rivals to access the 'tap and go' technology of iPhones,\" the EU's competition chief Margrethe Vestager said. The decision will prevent Apple \"from excluding other mobile wallets from the iPhone's ecosystem.\"\n\nUnder the EU settlement, consumers in Europe will be able to use alternative digital wallets to pay for goods and services at checkouts. The commitments remain binding for 10 years and Apple risks a fine of as much as 10 per cent of global annual revenue if it violates the agreement.\n\nThe closing of the investigation marks a brief respite between the EU and Apple, which have long been at loggerheads over how the Cupertino, California-based firm toes the regulatory line in Brussels.\n\nEarlier this year, the company challenged a 1.8 billion euros (S$2.6 billion) EU fine it was hit with for thwarting fair competition from music-streaming rivals, including Spotify Technology This fine came after it was previously handed a record 13 billion euros tax bill in a dispute with EU regulators over Irish state aid.\n\nThe firm has also been forced to overhaul its iOS, Safari and App Store offerings in the EU in order to step in line with the bloc's Digital Markets Act - a regulation against which it has filed a raft of legal challenges.\n\nApple's digital wallet allows consumers to store virtual debit and credit cards on iPhones, as well as ticket bookings. Its offer to the EU would allow third-party developers access to Apple's payment technology in order to help them create alternative mobile wallets, the commission said on Thursday (Jul 11).\n\nIn response to the settlement, Apple said it is rolling out access to its payments chip in Europe while also allowing contactless transactions for car and home keys, corporate badges, loyalty cards, and event tickets.

That ends the threat of but it also creates an opening for banks and rival mobile payment wallets.\n\nand are taking a shot. Samsung Next, the South Korean technology company's venture capital arm, at the end of June made an investment in Curve, a London-based digital payment company that sells a single payment card that can store other cards.\n\nThe investment, of undisclosed value, comes as Curve finishes work on a mobile payment app that will be available on iOS in the European Union by the end of this year and potentially in other markets such as the U.K. and U.S. Both Curve and Samsung sniff an opportunity as Apple faces challenges to open its technology to outside parties. In addition to he EU settlement, the is also investigating Apple's payment policies\n\n\"Until this point, iOS users have been exposed only to Apple Pay for digital payments, a severe restriction in choice and to the detriment of consumers,\" said Jonathan Gugenheim, chief of staff for Curve, adding that the Curve Pay app will enable anyone with an iPhone to combine cards through Curve's all-in-one service. \"We're hopeful that regulators in the U.K. and U.S. will follow Europe's lead and help ensure there is a fair and competitive market for mobile payments on iOS devices just like there already is on Samsung, Google, and other mobile phone manufacturers' ecosystems.\"\n\nCurve's Apple Pay alternative will replace an earlier user experience in which consumers had to add their Curve card to Apple Wallet Pay and complete the transaction through the Apple Pay.\n\n\"This is unnecessary friction and the new, slicker experience made possible by Apple's concession to the European Commission will make paying even easier for consumers,\" Gugenheim said.\n\nThe introduction of Curve Pay will also save banks funds that are currently diverted to Apple in transaction fees, Guggenheim said. \"That's a cost banks have been reluctantly incurring since the inauguration of Apple Pay,\" he said.\n\nSamsung and Curve have an existing partnership. In the U.K., Samsung Pay uses Curve's technology to offer users more payment flexibility. By integrating Curve's \"all in one card'\" technology, Samsung Pay enables users to consolidate multiple payment cards into a single digital card within the Samsung Pay app and give customers ubiquitous acceptance, according to Carlos Castellanos, an investor at Samsung Next.\n\nAdditionally, Curve's \"back in time\" feature, which enables users to retroactively switch the payment card used for a transaction, benefits by offering no foreign exchange fees, Castellano said.\n\nCurve's mobile wallet will feature Samsung Pay and other options. \"The Samsung Next investment will help Curve to better understand the nuances of global wallet expansion and potentially make the mobile app and 'wearable tech' more seamless and user-friendly,\" Gugenheim said.\n\nApple is slowly expanding access to its ecosystem in response to regulatory actions. in late June said the App Store's payment policy is potentially violating competition rules, threatening to fine Apple 10% of its global revenue, or about $40 billion, a threat that the EU has waived. The EU also accused Apple of hindering access to the Near Field Communication technology on iPhones, potentially giving Apple Pay an unfair advantage.\n\nApple threatened to not release new artificial intelligence products in Europe due to the regulatory move, though it did tell local media that it hoped to find a solution that would allow the release of the new technology.\n\nhave faced similar regulatory pressure and lawsuits globally involving its app store payment fees for third-party developers, which have been as high as 30%. Apple did not provide comment for this story by deadline, though it has lowered some app store fees and extended access to its NFC technology for mobile payments in early 2024. Apple also faces a lawsuit over its in the U.K. In the U.S., the Department of Justice is investigating Apple over company policies that govern access to Apple technology, raising similar anti-competition concerns as the EC has raised. The pressure on Apple could provide an opportunity for other mobile wallets, such as the U.S. bank-led .\n\n\"Regulators and lawsuits on both sides of the Atlantic are prying open Apple's closed ecosystem,\" said Eric Grover, a principal at Intrepid Ventures. \"Still, Apple will resist and will still have considerable influence.\"\n\nBeyond regulatory moves against Apple, there's also a growing international market for digital wallets, which in 2023 made up 50% of global e-commerce spending, or about $1.6 trillion of a $3.2 trillion market, according to Global Payments Report for 2024. Digital wallets also make up about 30% of all global point-of-sale volume, or $3.2 trillion out of a $10.8 trillion total, according to Worldpay. Mobile wallets are on pace to reach $12 trillion of a total $25 trillion e-commerce and point of sale market by 2027, Worldpay reports.\n\nIn the U.S., mobile wallet spending increased from 0.6% of all card spending in 2019 to 6% in 2023 and more than 7% in the first two months of 2024, according to research from . And while the average payment size for mobile wallets fell from $40 in 2021 to $33 for the first two months of 2024, Fiserv attributed that to an expansion of mobile wallet usage into different payment types.\n\nAnd among banks, 51% of executives say at least 60% of their initiatives in 2024 will have a mobile-first approach, according to , American Banker's publisher.\n\nChallenger digital wallets and payment processors both have opportunities to rival Apple in the App Store and on the iOS platform, according to Grover.\n\n\"There's only room for a handful of big general-purpose digital wallets,\" Grover said. \"The stakes are big.\"\n\nThe EU's pressure on Apple and Google opens up potential for other wallets, but both Apple Pay and Google Wallet already allow consumers to pick from a variety of loaded funding sources, and Apple Pay is expanding to include Affirm and other BNPL providers, including conventional credit cards, said Aaron McPherson, principal at AFM Consulting.\n\n\"Curve does have additional features that could make it attractive, such as rules on which funding source to use with which merchant, or automatically selecting an alternate funding source in case of a decline or appearing as a debit card for bill payments,\" McPherson said. \"Apple or Google could add these features in the future, however.\"", "source": {"uri":

This prevented others from launching NFC mobile wallets on the iPhone. Today the European Commission said it made Apple's commitments legally binding for ten years and also expanded them.\n\nApple had already opened up access to NFC to certain developers in the EU in January without charge. It also allows another wallet to be set as the default payment app. However, it tried to limit access to licensed payment service providers or their developers. Apple dropped that restriction alongside some additional commitments.\n\nThe Commission consulted other providers to see whether Apple's commitments address their competition concerns.\n\nNotably, the deal involves access to NFC in Host Card Emulation mode ('HCE'). Credentials are not stored in the secure element of the device. Instead, the bank keeps them in a private cloud. It sends some short term credentials to the phone in advance to support contactless payments.\n\nIn its January announcement, Apple said that \"HCE apps, which are software-based solutions, can be more susceptible to attack vectors whereby payment transaction tokens and other sensitive financial data may be compromised, including through exposure to untrusted and potentially malicious entities.\" That was its rationale for restricting access to licensed entities.\n\nMeanwhile, in April, the European Central Bank (ECB) gave an update on its design for offline tap to pay functionality for the digital euro.

In addition, Apple will offer easy-to-use functionalities, such as making these apps default instead of the company's Wallet, double-clicking on the Side Button for quick access, and Face ID authentication.\n\nAccording to a letter from European Commission Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, Apple was wrong to limit NFC payments with only its built-in option since \"NFC technology was not developed by Apple. It is a standardized technology. It is made available for free.\" That said, three were the reasons to make Cupertino open up this technology to third-party makers:\n\nAfter months of testing, Apple will now give third-party mobile wallets free access to NFC functionality. However, Apple won't open its Secure Enclave, as these wallets will use a \"Hos Card Emulation Mode,\" although the European Commission says \"it offers an equivalent solution in terms of security and user experience.\"\n\nIn addition, double-click and face ID authentication will also work with third-party wallets. Also, Apple will let users choose their default iPhone Wallet.

The European Commission began investigating Apple's restrictions on the iPhone's NFC chip over four years ago and issued charges in 2022. Apple proposed changes earlier this year. The Commission asked app developers and various financial services companies for their opinions, then asked Apple to make some tweaks. Apple came back with a revised set of commitments, which the Commission announced today.\n\nUnder the commitments, Apple will have to give third-party mobile wallet developers NFC access for free, using a fair and objective process to decide their eligibility. These third-party wallets will run in host card emulation (HCE) mode to ensure secure storage of payment credentials, as already happens on Android. The Commission claims this is as secure as Apple Pay's method of relying on a hardware \"secure element\" to protect details, and offers the same user experience.\n\nUsers will get to choose whichever wallet they like as the default, so it automatically pops up with a double-click on the side, or when the phone is placed next to a reader. People with Apple IDs registered in the EEA will also get to tap away with third-party wallets while traveling outside the region, but only if they're on a temporary trip. Developers will also be able to combine their newfound payments functionality with other NFC-based features like using the phone as a concert ticket or car key.\n\nThe European Central Bank has given its stamp of approval to the changes, though it also suggested Apple might find itself saddled with further obligations when the digital euro becomes a reality (it's currently in the preparation phase).\n\n\"From now on, Apple can no longer use its control over the iPhone ecosystem to keep other mobile wallets out of the market,\" crowed the Commission's antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, in a press conference today. \"Competing wallet developers, as well as consumers, will benefit from these changes, opening up innovation and choice, while keeping payments secure.\"\n\nTaken alongside Apple's grudging acceptance of third-party iOS app stores -- one of its many obligations under the EU's new Digital Markets Act -- it's clear that the company's control is eroding fast.\n\nThis may only affect Europe for now, and there may yet be teething trouble in the implementation, but Apple's big problem is that the rest of the world is watching. If third-party app stores and wallets can work in Europe without the sky caving in, then they can work elsewhere. And when the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or some other national regulator proposes a similar change, Apple won't have much of a counterargument.\n\nIn other Apple news, Bloomberg reports that the company's $3,499 Vision Pro virtual-reality headset still hasn't broken the barrier of selling 100,000 units in a quarter, and U.S. sales in particular are likely to crater until a cheaper version comes along.\n\nAMD AI M&A. AMD is buying a Finnish company called Silo AI for $665 million. It's the biggest acquisition of a privately held European AI company yet. AMD SVP Vamsi Boppana told the Financial Times that the all-cash deal \"helps us both accelerate our customer engagements and deployments while also helping us accelerate our own AI tech stack.\" Silo's 300-strong team will build custom large language models for AMD.\n\nIntuit layoffs. The accounting software firm Intuit is laying off 1,800 workers, more than 1,000 of whom have not been meeting the company's expectations, management said yesterday. However, as Fortune reports, Intuit also intends to hire at least 1,800 people next year as it pushes to incorporate AI into its services.\n\nGermany bans Huawei. Germany has forbidden the use of Huawei and ZTE equipment in its 5G networks, in a somewhat belated concession to the U.S., which doesn't want its allies using Chinese gear in such sensitive places. This is a very belated move. The U.S. hasn't allowed its network operators to use such equipment for the last 12 years -- and, as Politico reports, Germany will also take longer than expected to implement its ban. Operators will only have to get Huawei and ZTE out of their core network infrastructure by the end of 2026, and the companies' equipment will be able to remain on antenna masts through the end of 2029.\n\n-- The proportion of online subscription services that use at least one \"dark pattern\" when marketing their subscriptions, according to a report from the Federal Trade Commission and its international counterparts. These tricksy user-interface practices include things like steering the consumer towards pricier subscriptions or forcing them to fill out payment information to access a \"free trial\" of the subscription.\n\nExclusive: Armada lands $40 million in funding round led by Microsoft's M12, by Allie Garfinkle\n\nSamsung's new phones, premium watch, and ring signal the company is going all-in on AI, giving Apple a run for its money, by the Associated Press\n\nThe walls are closing in on Tesla: EV makers just took a bite out of its market share, and investor Bill Gross says it's a meme stock now, by Marco Quiroz-Gutierrez\n\nAI has destroyed Google's promise of carbon neutrality, with emissions rising 50% over the last five years, by Eva Roytburg\n\nMicrosoft shakes up its Game Pass service, hiking prices and dropping day-one games from the standard tier, by Chris Morris\n\nAsk Andy: Can generative AI solve a startup's problems?, by Andy Dunn\n\nMicrosoft cloud settlement.

In a deal with European cloud industry body CISPE, which lodged the complaint, Microsoft will let CISPE's members more cheaply run its Azure cloud stack and services on their infrastructure. It will also pay them over $21 million to cover the excessive licensing costs they had to pay in the last couple years. However, Reuters reports that the settlement does not apply to Amazon Web Services, CISPE's biggest member, so both AWS and Google Cloud are still loudly complaining about Microsoft's licensing

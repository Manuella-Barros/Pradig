Cricket South Africa (CSA) announced this development in a media release on July 31.\n\nThis series marks the first-ever bilateral series between the two sides, though they have previously met in the 50-over World Cups of 2019 and 2023, with South Africa winning both encounters. Their most recent meeting was in the T20 World Cup 2024 semi-final in Trinidad, where South Africa triumphed by nine wickets to reach their first-ever World Cup final, ultimately falling short against India. Overall, South Africa and Afghanistan have played three T20 Internationals (T20Is), with South Africa emerging victorious in all three. The forthcoming ODI series will be a significant milestone in the cricketing relations between the two nations.\n\nCSA Chairman Lawson Naidoo expressed excitement about the series, acknowledging Afghanistan's competitive spirit demonstrated in recent ICC tournaments. \"We are excited to embark on this historic ODI series with Afghanistan, who have become a very competitive all-round team as evidenced by their recent performances in the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023 and most recently at the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024. This is a significant milestone in our cricketing relations, and we look forward to a competitive and entertaining series,\" Naidoo was quoted as saying by the Cricbuzz.\n\nOriginally not part of the Future Tours Program (FTP), the series was arranged following productive negotiations between the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) and Cricket South Africa. ACB Chairman Mirwais Ashraf expressed his delight in hosting South Africa, highlighting the productive negotiations that led to this arrangement. \"These fixtures were not initially part of our FTP. Still, based on our productive negotiations with our counterparts at Cricket South Africa, we concluded that we will host the Proteas for an ODI series in September. They are an excellent team, and we are eagerly looking forward to hosting them and playing them regularly in the future,\" Ashraf stated.\n\nThis series adds to South Africa's busy schedule in September and October. Following the ODI series against Afghanistan, South Africa are set to play three T20Is and as many ODIs against Ireland in Abu Dhabi, starting September 27. Prior to this, South Africa will be engaged in two Tests and three T20Is against the West Indies in the Caribbean, beginning on August 7. For Afghanistan, the series against South Africa provides an opportunity to showcase their skills against a Test-playing nation, shortly after their potential historic Test match against New Zealand in Greater Noida, India, from September 9 to 13.\n\nThe fixtures for the Afghanistan & South Africa tour of UAE, 2024, are as follows:", "source": {"uri": "crickettimes.com", "dataType": "news",

The series will be played in the month of September. The dates for the series have been announced by the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB), who expressed their desire to play even more top-tier teams.\n\nThe series marks a historic occasion for both the teams who will be playing each other for the first time in a bilateral series. All the matches will be played at the iconic Sharjah Cricket Stadium, Sharjah, UAE.\n\nAlso read: \"Rahul Dravid did it very well, but\"- Nasser Hussain raises concerns Brendon McCullum's suitability for dual coaching role after Matthew Mott's exit\n\nAll the matches will be ODIs which means it will be a great preparation for both the teams for the 2025 Champions Trophy, scheduled to be held in February-March next year. The three ODIs will be played on September 18, 20, and 22 respectively.\n\nACB chairman Mirwais Ashraf was pleased to announce the historic occasion. \"The recent ICC meeting was quite productive for us. Apart from confirming dates for the one-off Test match against New Zealand, we reached an agreement with Cricket South Africa for a series of three ODIs in September,\" Ashraf was quoted as saying by the ACB.\n\n\"These fixtures were not initially part of our FTP. Still, based on our productive negotiations with our counterparts at Cricket South Africa, we concluded that we will host the Proteas for an ODI series in September. They are an excellent team, and we are eagerly looking forward to hosting them and playing them regularly in the future,\" he added in his statement.\n\nMeanwhile, ACB CEO Naseeb Khan expressed his pleasure to host South Africa and claimed that Afghanistan has made significant strides in the past few years by playing top teams regularly. He also hoped for more matches against top teams in the upcoming future.\n\n\"We have consistently played higher-ranked teams over the past two or three years, which has significantly improved the quality of our game. Competing against top-tier teams allows our players to identify areas for improvement and boosts their confidence. Playing big teams regularly is a crucial part of our growth process, and we aim to provide more opportunities for our team to compete in bilateral cricket against these top teams,\" Naseeb Khan stated.\n\n\"Our team has performed well in ICC events over the last two years, and we are focused on making our team equally competitive in bilateral cricket,\" he added.\n\nAfghanistan have performed significantly well in the recent ICC events. In the ODI World Cup 2023 played in India, they defeated big teams like Pakistan and England to create history. Their performance went up to the next level in the T20 World Cup 2024, where they reached the semi-finals but lost to South Africa. This was their first ever semi-final in a senior ICC event.\n\nAfghanistan and South Africa have faced each other twice before in the ODI format and South Africa have emerged victorious in both of them. The first match was played in the ODI World Cup 2019 in Cardiff while the second match between these two teams was played in the ODI World Cup 2023 in Ahmedabad.", "source": {"uri":

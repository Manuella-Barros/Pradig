The global study Industrial AI: the new frontier for productivity, innovation and competition involved 1,700 senior decision makers from Manufacturing, Telecommunications, Aerospace & Defense, Services, Construction & Engineering, and Energy & Resources companies. It found that optimism about artificial intelligence (AI) is a direct indicator of AI strategy maturity within their business. The study found firms between $200-$500m the most optimistic about AI, while the UK and USA were the least optimistic countries.\n\nThe IFS Global AI Optimism League Table by Country\n\nCountry\n\nOptimism Rank\n\nNorway Get the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\n1\n\nSweden Advertisement\n\n2\n\nFrance\n\n3\n\nAustralia Advertisement\n\n4\n\nJapan\n\n5\n\nUAE Advertisement\n\n6\n\nCanada\n\n7\n\nDenmark Advertisement\n\n8\n\nFinland\n\n9\n\nGermany Advertisement\n\n10\n\nUK\n\n11\n\nUSA Advertisement\n\n12\n\nThe IFS Global AI Optimism League Table by Company Size\n\nRevenue Band\n\nOptimism Rank\n\n$300 Million - $499.99\n\nMillion\n\n1\n\n$200 Million - $299.99\n\nMillion\n\n2\n\n$500 Million or over\n\n3\n\n$100 Million - $199.99\n\nMillion\n\n4\n\n$50 Million - $99.99\n\nMillion\n\n5\n\nCash isn't always king\n\nAn easy assumption to make with AI is that the more financial resources available, the more optimism there would be about what could be done with AI. However, the research reveals that businesses with revenues of over $500 Million ranked only third in terms of optimism due to a clear polarization in strategy, data readiness, and skills. Indeed, the polarization in AI readiness has led to 25% of this group believing AI benefits will materialize within 12 months, while the laggards don't expect to see benefits for at least three years. Large enterprises showed the widest gaps in time to benefits of any of the company size groups surveyed.\n\nIn contrast, the survey revealed mid-sized ($50-$200m) firms being less optimistic about AI purely because they have fewer resources and skills to deploy to the technology today, and therefore are planning over a longer period of time to drive benefits from a maturing technology.\n\nChristian Pedersen, Chief Product Officer, IFS, commented: \"At the surface level, the lack of optimism across some respondents may suggest we are at the edge of a trough of disillusionment, particularly following the all-encompassing hype that AI enjoyed for much of the last 18 months. What we are actually witnessing is enterprises differentiating themselves with AI. Organizations that have established a strong data foundation, invested in skills, and embedded sustainability into their strategy are optimistic because they can see the benefits coming into view quickly. It is vital that leaders see AI as a strategy, not a tool.\"\n\nFactors paving the way on the smooth path to AI\n\nDelving into what fuels optimism around AI, the research suggests that companies' architectural readiness directly correlates with their overall optimism about the technology. Respondents who report being more architecturally ready are more likely to be optimistic about AI. This indicates that companies with a strong cloud-based foundation are further along in their AI journeys and are most likely to believe that the tangible benefits of AI will become a reality sooner.\n\nPedersen continued: \"We see direct evidence from our research that the market is splitting into those who have embraced AI and those who have not. There is an element of 'following the herd' fueling the board's desire for AI programs. McKinsey has found that AI could be the key to unlocking an additional $4.4 trillion in corporate profits per year, which is building pressure to adopt it. Without a clear direction and strategy, AI programs stall, making the end result seem further away than it needs to be.\"\n\nEmergence of Industrial AI for productivity, innovation and sustainability\n\nInnovative products and services (31%) and data accessibility (30%) are the most common areas senior decision-makers expect AI to make large differences, followed closely by cost reductions (29%). Interestingly, at a country level, the USA (32%) and Germany (31%) were the only nations most likely to believe that AI will lead to consistent business growth.\n\nThe survey reveals a positive correlation between skills and AI optimism. The nations most likely to identify as having invested heavily in skills for several years are generally more optimistic about AI overall. France (49%), UAE (53%), Norway (48%), Australia (46%), Sweden (46%) and Japan (45%) are leading the way here.\n\nSustainability planning also correlates directly with overall AI optimism. The less wide-ranging a country's sustainability strategy was with regard to AI, the less likely they were to be optimistic about AI in general. UK (5%), Canadian (6%), Danish (6%) and Finnish (4%) respondents were least likely to have an AI strategy for sustainability in place and all feature in the bottom half of the optimism league table.\n\n\"The lofty expectations for AI bely a fundamental misunderstanding of how it is supposed to drive value. The real power lies in Industrial AI, where data flows through every part of your business, combining structured, interlinked datasets to uncover insights, optimize every process and marry the digital with the physical world. That's where the true value lies. If a business doesn't have a strategy to reach that point, then they need a partner who can guide them on that journey,\" concluded Pedersen.\n\nDiscover more insights and actions in the Industrial AI: the new frontier for productivity, innovation and competition Executive Report.\n\nResearch Methodology:\n\nCensuswide surveyed 1,709 C-level/President/SVP/Directors who work in Manufacturing, Telecommunications, A&D, Services, Construction & Engineering or Energy & resources in organizations with $50m+ annual revenue (Aged 18+) across the UK, USA, Canada, Germany, France, UAE, Norway, Japan, Australia, Sweden, Denmark and Finland.\n\nAbout IFS:\n\nIFS develops and delivers cloud enterprise software for companies around the world who manufacture and distribute goods, build and maintain assets, and manage service-focused operations.

AI could solve all of these problems, at least in theory, and save companies money to boot. But customers hate the idea, according to a recent survey by Gartner. The main reason is that they think AI will make it much harder to reach a human agent.\n\nA majority (64%) of 5,728 people surveyed by Gartner in December 2023 said they would prefer companies not to use AI in their customer service. Additionally, 53% of customers hate the idea so much that they would consider switching to a competitor if they found out a company was going to use AI for customer service.\n\nThe survey is timely because customer service leaders are eager to use AI, with 60% under pressure to adopt the technology, according to Gartner senior principal Keith McIntosh.\n\nThe respondents said their top concerns were that it would become more difficult to reach a person, AI would displace jobs, and the technology would provide the wrong answers. Other fears are that their data would be less secure and AI biases would not treat customers equally.\n\n\"Many customers fear that GenAI will simply become another obstacle between them and an agent,\" McIntosh said.\n\nOne solution for companies itching to try out the technology in their customer service operations is to promise customers that they will be connected to an agent in the event that the AI cannot provide an answer, McIntosh said. \"It must then seamlessly transform into an agent chat that picks up where the chatbot left off.\"\n\nConsumer disapproval of AI use in customer service is unlikely to keep firms from deploying the technology as the cost savings are just too great. AI in general can automate routine tasks and inquiries, and this applies to customer service as well. To be fair to companies, AI can also be used to augment human customer service reps by providing them with answers faster than they could look up themselves.\n\nBut there are some human touches that AI simply can't fake for customers. AI is no doubt efficient, but it struggles with responding to complex emotional situations that require human empathy. And like human reps, sometimes it just flat out gets things wrong.\n\nOne recent example is McDonald's decision to discontinue the use of AI in some of its drive-thrus due to the errors it was making - errors that found their way onto social media.", "source": {"uri": "techspot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechSpot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "skye_jacobs@techspot.com", "name": "Skye Jacobs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gartner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Booting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Empathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.techspot.com/images2/news/bigimage/2024/07/2024-07-10-image-3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724323", "eventUri": "eng-9724323", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The study found firms between $200-$500m the most optimistic about AI, while the UK and USA were the least optimistic countries.\n\nThe IFS Global AI Optimism League Table by Country\n\nCountry\n\nOptimism Rank\n\nNorway\n\n1\n\nSweden\n\n2\n\nFrance\n\n3\n\nAustralia\n\n4\n\nJapan\n\n5\n\nUAE\n\n6\n\nCanada\n\n7\n\nDenmark\n\n8\n\nFinland\n\n9\n\nGermany\n\n10\n\nUK\n\n11\n\nUSA\n\n12\n\nThe IFS Global AI Optimism League Table by Company Size\n\nRevenue Band\n\nOptimism Rank\n\n$300 Million - $499.99\n\nMillion\n\n1\n\n$200 Million - $299.99\n\nMillion\n\n2\n\n$500 Million or over\n\n3\n\n$100 Million - $199.99\n\nMillion\n\n4\n\n$50 Million - $99.99\n\nMillion\n\n5\n\nCash isn't always king\n\nAn easy assumption to make with AI is that the more financial resources available, the more optimism there would be about what could be done with AI. However, the research reveals that businesses with revenues of over $500 Million ranked only third in terms of optimism due to a clear polarization in strategy, data readiness, and skills. Indeed, the polarization in AI readiness has led to 25% of this group believing AI benefits will materialize within 12 months, while the laggards don't expect to see benefits for at least three years. Large enterprises showed the widest gaps in time to benefits of any of the company size groups surveyed.\n\nIn contrast, the survey revealed mid-sized ($50-$200m) firms being less optimistic about AI purely because they have fewer resources and skills to deploy to the technology today, and therefore are planning over a longer period of time to drive benefits from a maturing technology.\n\nChristian Pedersen, Chief Product Officer, IFS, commented: \"At the surface level, the lack of optimism across some respondents may suggest we are at the edge of a trough of disillusionment, particularly following the all-encompassing hype that AI enjoyed for much of the last 18 months. What we are actually witnessing is enterprises differentiating themselves with AI. Organizations that have established a strong data foundation, invested in skills, and embedded sustainability into their strategy are optimistic because they can see the benefits coming into view quickly. It is vital that leaders see AI as a strategy, not a tool.\"\n\nFactors paving the way on the smooth path to AI\n\nDelving into what fuels optimism around AI, the research suggests that companies' architectural readiness directly correlates with their overall optimism about the technology. Respondents who report being more architecturally ready are more likely to be optimistic about AI. This indicates that companies with a strong cloud-based foundation are further along in their AI journeys and are most likely to believe that the tangible benefits of AI will become a reality sooner.\n\nPedersen continued: \"We see direct evidence from our research that the market is splitting into those who have embraced AI and those who have not. There is an element of 'following the herd' fueling the board's desire for AI programs. McKinsey has found that AI could be the key to unlocking an additional $4.4 trillion in corporate profits per year, which is building pressure to adopt it. Without a clear direction and strategy, AI programs stall, making the end result seem further away than it needs to be.\"\n\nEmergence of Industrial AI for productivity, innovation and sustainability\n\nInnovative products and services (31%) and data accessibility (30%) are the most common areas senior decision-makers expect AI to make large differences, followed closely by cost reductions (29%). Interestingly, at a country level, the USA (32%) and Germany (31%) were the only nations most likely to believe that AI will lead to consistent business growth.\n\nThe survey reveals a positive correlation between skills and AI optimism. The nations most likely to identify as having invested heavily in skills for several years are generally more optimistic about AI overall. France (49%), UAE (53%), Norway (48%), Australia (46%), Sweden (46%) and Japan (45%) are leading the way here.\n\nSustainability planning also correlates directly with overall AI optimism. The less wide-ranging a country's sustainability strategy was with regard to AI, the less likely they were to be optimistic about AI in general. UK (5%), Canadian (6%), Danish (6%) and Finnish (4%) respondents were least likely to have an AI strategy for sustainability in place and all feature in the bottom half of the optimism league table.\n\n\"The lofty expectations for AI bely a fundamental misunderstanding of how it is supposed to drive value. The real power lies in Industrial AI, where data flows through every part of your business, combining structured, interlinked datasets to uncover insights, optimize every process and marry the digital with the physical world. That's where the true value lies. If a business doesn't have a strategy to reach that point, then they need a partner who can guide them on that journey,\" concluded Pedersen.\n\nDiscover more insights and actions in the Industrial AI: the new frontier for productivity, innovation and competition Executive Report.\n\nResearch Methodology:\n\nCensuswide surveyed 1,709 C-level/President/SVP/Directors who work in Manufacturing, Telecommunications, A&D, Services, Construction & Engineering or Energy & resources in organizations with $50m+ annual revenue (Aged 18+) across the UK, USA, Canada, Germany, France, UAE, Norway, Japan, Australia, Sweden, Denmark and Finland.\n\nAbout IFS:\n\nIFS develops and delivers cloud enterprise software for companies around the world who manufacture and distribute goods, build and maintain assets, and manage service-focused operations.

In this article, we'll look at some of the potential pitfalls and challenges when planning a successful AI project.\n\nAI projects often fail to have their intended impact due to a lack of clearly defined objectives. Gartner predicted that 85% of AI projects over 2022 would deliver erroneous outcomes due to bias in data, algorithms or the teams responsible for managing them.\n\nSetting yourself up for AI success requires clearly defined KPIs and outcomes that you can measure with metrics to determine success. Examples could include increased customer conversions, mission accomplished analytics goals, increased customer referrals or reduced customer service interventions.\n\nUnless you are an enterprise organisation or software business, you're probably not going to be building your own in-house AI team.\n\nSimilarly, when defining your AI use case it's best to start small in scope. Good examples could include:\n\nAI systems often have limited understanding of context in language versus humans, so consider how you could provide context to recommendations.\n\nWhile Large Language Model (LLM) AIs can interpret a user's requirements or goals from their chat requests, consider how adding more context in your training data could deliver better results.\n\nWhen working with LLMs, this can be achieved in a number of ways:\n\nPrompt Engineering - this is the process of crafting clear instructions using specific keywords and phrases to fine-tune the AI's response.\n\nAdding context to instructions - this could be background information that helps explain your request, giving the model a better understanding of your needs.\n\nProviding the AI model with examples - providing the AI with examples of your intended output can help to refine responses during the training process.\n\nBias can also be a risk factor in AI, so it's best to implement restrictions on what topics your AI can and cannot engage with, if your solution is customer facing. A human in the loop during testing and after rollout is essential.\n\nThe quality of your data dictates whether your AI solution is viable or not. Consider for example using an AI model to identify trends in climate change. If the data is not cleansed to account for missing values over years or underlying inconsistencies, your results will be skewed.\n\nConsider creating a yardstick for data quality and scoring all data input, to ensure good results.\n\nLet's take the example of applying AI to recommendations in a video-streaming application such as Netflix or YouTube. AI could be readily employed as an alternative to algorithms to serve the user content recommendations based on their past viewing history and similar content.\n\nHowever, this can result in a self-fulfilling prophesy as the user consumes similar video within a bubble, unaware of the content that sits outside. Much like trending or popular articles on a website feed, without a degree of editorial curation AI recommendations can trap your audience in a cul-de-sac of similar content.\n\nThat's fine for engagement when you're capturing impressions for advertising revenue, but not so great when using AI to signpost training materials or marketing resources.\n\nIdentifying the right AI platform or model to use can feel daunting, with a plethora of choices including Google AI, AWS, Microsoft Azure AI, Bot Framework and Copilot, and Open AI ChatGPT. Each offer different benefits depending on your chosen tech stack and potential integration points with other platforms.\n\nTraining an AI model from scratch also represents a significant time and cost investment.\n\nA less costly and time-consuming approach to training your own model could be leveraging a pre-existing one. AWS offers a marketplace of pretrained AI models for Amazon SageMaker for tasks like object recognition and classification and natural language processing.\n\nHarnessing an existing model can accelerate your project and reduce your time to market. Similarly, Google has a range of developer-friendly AI services and Microsoft offers ready-made AI services and models as part of its toolchain.\n\nThe biggest barrier to AI success is likely to be a lack of staff skills. While not everyone is going to contribute to an AI project, data and AI literacy within your teams will be important success factors. Awareness of foundational concepts such as prompt engineering and data quality can enable more effective communication and collaboration over AI initiatives.\n\nAlso consider workspace tools that have AI baked-in, such as the benefits of Microsoft Copilot which works across Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams.\n\nDeveloping a dedicated Microsoft Teams app could enable access to the Azure bot framework, which can be used to automate manual tasks, signpost resources and enhance workflows. Consider the value of an AI assistant that can access Microsoft Active Directory to understand who your staff member is, their job role and what they need to be successful.\n\nBe strategic about where you employ AI in your solution. AI is frequently used as a search tool for the signposting of content, and it can be tempting to point a bot at your site to index everything and have it take the load off your busy customer services teams.\n\nThis can help, but might result in higher operational costs, as your solution scales with your audience demand.\n\nA better solution might be to break down the problem, using traditional code to solve some of the challenges. For example, you could implement a scraping tool to help manage the indexing of your site content.\n\nYou could also look at a software tool to help you manage and tag all uploaded content, reducing the need to endlessly re- index your site. You could audit your site to ensure alt tagging for imagery can be understood by your bot. Again, consider the value of giving your AI proper examples of your content to help ensure better results for your audience.\n\nConsider also that if you are using a single LLM in its entirety to solve the problem inits entirety, your AI solution will be similar to your competitors following a similar approach. Consider investments in tooling, processes and refinements that will give your AI solution the edge.", "source": {"uri": "digit.fyi", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digit"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief technology officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Performance indicator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gartner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Industrial Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Web Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prompt engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_365", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft 365"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Spreadsheets", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Spreadsheets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information_Retrieval", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information Retrieval", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 97}], "image": "http://www.digit.fyi/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Untitled-design-2024-07-11T112734.376.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724323", "eventUri": "eng-9724323", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

New copilot tools, virtual assistants and LLMs are developed every week to assist organizations with a multitude of functions. As these technologies become more pervasive, every organization needs an internal code of conduct to mitigate the risks and govern the way that AI is used internally.\n\nIn essence, AI governance is an extension of existing privacy and security rules, because it simply builds on organizations' existing data processing practices. In the same way that organizations have policies defining who can access their data and how it should be handled, an AI code of conduct clearly defines what is an acceptable use of AI. By being proactive in establishing these guidelines, organizations can enable their teams to adopt these tools quickly to stay at the forefront of innovation, while ensuring they are doing so in a safe and secure manner.\n\nHow to craft an AI code of conduct\n\nIt's important that AI policy is driven both from above and below, with executive and employee support, and there are strong incentives to do so. Executives need to ensure their use of AI keeps them in compliance with upcoming regulations such as NIS2, while employees want clear guidance on which tools they can use, for which use cases.\n\nHere are four key considerations IT leaders should consider when implementing their own AI code of conduct.\n\n1. Integrate AI into existing procurement processes\n\nAn AI code of conduct should first outline the steps that employees need to complete before they can procure or begin using any new tools. Many organizations consider reinventing the wheel to accommodate AI tools, but this creates a significant amount of unnecessary work. Instead, they should subject any AI tool to the same rigorous procurement process that applies to any product that concerns data security.\n\nThe procurement process must also take into consideration the organization's privacy and ethical standards, to ensure these are never compromised in the name of new technology. Whenever anyone wants to enable a new AI tool, it should have the same safeguards as any other technology product that the organization uses.\n\nIn addition, to streamline the decision-making process around new AI tools, organizations should centralize requests under a cross-departmental governance board, with representatives from multiple areas of the business, including engineering, business, security and legal teams. To succeed, this board must act as a facilitator rather than a blocker. It needs the mechanisms in place to consider individual use cases, business applications and cost benefits of different AI tools to select the best ones for the organization.\n\n2. Ban free tools with unclear privacy and security guardrails\n\nGiven the wide range of use cases for readily available AI tools, organizations could quickly find that different teams are using their own solutions, often with free personal licenses rather than paid commercial ones. However, what these employees often don't realize is that free tools' privacy rules are more lenient, and can give vendors access to the company's data. It's important to be conscious of the privacy policies of AI tools when using these in an enterprise environment -- and be sure to only use these with a commercial license.\n\nTo address this risk, an AI code of conduct should stipulate that free tools are categorically banned for use in any business context. Instead, employees should be required to use an approved, officially procured commercial license solution, with full privacy protections.\n\n3. Take a security-first approach to vendors and partners\n\nEvery organization needs to remain aware of how their technology vendors use AI in the products and services that they buy from them. To enable this, an AI code of conduct should also enforce policies to enable organizations to keep track of their vendor agreements. Solutions owners need to ensure that the terms of their agreements don't change, and security remains a priority as AI is introduced into the products they use.\n\nFor example, AI-powered text summarization and transcription tools built into video conferencing solutions can be invaluable for note taking but could expose sensitive data if vendors use it to train LLMs. One of the most recent examples of this was seen in the case of a popular collaboration tool, when it was revealed that the provider was using the messages and files being shared between its users to train its AI capabilities, without their consent. To counteract this risk, organizations should build their AI code of conduct with data security as a core consideration. Even if this means restricting certain uses of AI, such as forbidding the use of AI assistants to transcribe meetings, it significantly limits the risk organizations can be exposed to through inappropriate or unmanaged AI usage.\n\n4. Demonstrate how to use AI effectively\n\nIn many organizations, AI remains a relatively new tool. While employees have a basic understanding of how AI works, they may not have the knowledge needed to get the best results from it.\n\nFor example, there is a common misconception that tools like ChatGPT \"think\" like a human and can retain the context from previous questions they've been asked. In reality, an AI tool can only remember conversational context in a very limited way, which can influence the reliability of the output they generate. As a result, IT support teams often find themselves repeatedly being asked the same questions by employees struggling to deal with similar AI-related challenges.\n\nTo address this, an AI code of conduct should also help to establish employee expectations for what the technology can and can't do, and what skills they need to make the most of it. Organizations can support this by implementing a training program to brief teams on how AI tools work as their knowledge grows and the technology evolves. While team members don't need specialist AI skills, they should be equipped with the basic knowledge needed to use the tools effectively.\n\nCreating a virtuous cycle of AI conduct\n\nNo organization operates in a vacuum, so in addition to governing their own internal use of AI, it is crucial to hold every company they work with accountable for their practices and ensure they uphold the same standards.\n\nOrganizations should also establish a trust center, and design their AI policies to be public facing. This allows them to be transparent in how they use and implement AI tools, so their customers and other stakeholders have clarity.\n\nBy putting positive, proactive AI policies into the public domain, organizations can learn from one another, and shape their own code of conduct accordingly. The goal of this is to create a virtuous cycle of AI governance, where organizations are able to work together to ensure we all use these game-changing technologies responsibly and successfully to the benefit of all.", "source": {"uri": "venturebeat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VentureBeat"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Use case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_conduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Code of conduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procurement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Procurement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outline (list)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Videotelephony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_support", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Technical support"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public domain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools/Trade_Specific_and_Specialty", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools/Trade Specific and Specialty", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AdobeStock_227747419.jpeg?w=1024?w=1200&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724323", "eventUri": "eng-9724323", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

But they can't ignore concerns about AI use, especially when it could mean losing customers.\n\n\"Once customers exhaust self-service options, they're ready to reach out to a person. Many customers fear that GenAI will simply become another obstacle between them and an agent. The onus is on service and support leaders to show customers that AI can streamline the service experience.\"\n\nThe report maintains that organisations must build customers' trust in AI by ensuring their GenAI capabilities follow the best practices. Customers must know the AI-infused journey will deliver better solutions and seamless guidance, including connecting them to a person when necessary.\n\nMcIntosh concluded: \"AI-infused chatbots must communicate to the customer that they will connect them to an agent in the event that the AI cannot provide a solution.\n\n\"It must then seamlessly transform into an agent chat that picks up where the chatbot left off. This way, the customer can trust that they will be able to efficiently find their solution while using the AI-infused channel.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nMarketers caught napping in stampede to adopt AI tools\n\nBrands 'flying blind' on AI execution as skills crisis bites\n\nMarketers 'must invest in creativity to get AI to shine'\n\nCopywriters 'set to drive the next wave of generative AI'\n\nCMOs admit lack of expertise is thwarting AI adoption\n\nAI to turbocharge economy but staffing threat looms", "source": {"uri": "decisionmarketing.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "decisionmarketing.co.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gartner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Consulting", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://www.decisionmarketing.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/robot_ai_cyborg-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724323", "eventUri": "eng-9724323", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

AI and its potential were suddenly of great interest, especially in how it brings value to businesses and how it will change our lives. AI systems have the ability to teach themselves, organise, and interpret information, and make predictions based on the information. It is the hot topic of discourse globally, from conferences to coffee tables.\n\nIn a developing region such as ASEAN, adoption of technology is high due to its digital connectivity and young population. ASEAN is currently the fifth-largest economy in the world and is projected to move up to be fourth-largest by 2030. In the next decade, ASEAN is expected to grow as one of the fastest growing regions in the global economy and to build dominance in Asia-Pacific. In addition, about 60 per cent of ASEAN's total population is currently under 35 years old.\n\nFor Vietnam, the potential is tremendous. With internet connectivity close to 80 per cent and growing, Vietnam is ready for expansion, and much more can be achieved with digitalisation and technology such as AI.\n\nAs technology continues to evolve, our businesses keep innovating. AI can be used to improve business in many aspects, from internal processes to external engagements. For business processes, AI enables automation for repetitive tasks in the area such as accounting, IT operations, human resources, supply chain and logistics, and sales and marketing. It is able to speed up, simplify, and redefine traditional processes to make it seamless and effective.\n\nAI-assisted tools are highly effective in sales and marketing as they are able to provide targeted and intelligent marketing based on the data analytics. This helps business to understand the customers' preferences, needs and wants better. For an AI tool to be powerful and mature, it needs to be populated with the necessary datasets and time to learn.\n\nThe industries which will benefit tremendously from AI and data analytics are cybersecurity, financial services, manufacturing, healthcare, and education.\n\nAs nations and economy move towards digitalisation, to improve efficiency and increase quality of life, cybersecurity becomes the pillar to secure and protect the realm. The introduction and application of AI and data analytics in cybersecurity give a tremendous edge in detecting threats, analysing attacks, automating incident response to mitigate damage and understand security controls effectiveness.\n\nIn financial services, AI provides insights and intelligence for financial data analytics, e-verification processes, financial performance measurements, fraud detection and prevention, and personalised banking and financial services. In a growing economy like Vietnam, the use of AI in the financial sector will be a key differentiator.\n\nManufacturing is another sector that can be synergised with AI. The introduction of AI begins at the conceptualisation and design stage, as AI can analyse market trends, study product research, and market feedback to provide the necessary inputs and ideas to generate innovative designs. With AI and data analytics, manufacturers can have autonomous supply chain performance, with little human oversight. Maintenance can be predictive and proactive and quality checks can be automated, with AI and data analytics identifying patterns in production data.\n\nAI is reinventing and reinvigorating healthcare. AI makes research and development on drug discovery more efficient in costing and time, being able to predict side effects and identifying candidates for clinical trials. Medical diagnostic is another exciting AI healthcare application, being able to predict and diagnose disease faster and with higher accuracy. AI-assisted surgeries using robots have higher precision, leading to fewer complications and quicker recovery time.\n\nIn education, AI can be used to augment the role of teachers by supporting and automating routine duties and tasks of teachers. AI and data analytics are promising in revolutionising students-focused assessments to give invaluable insights for students to learn and excel, with personalised learning contents and experiences.\n\nWhile the transformative potential of AI is tremendous and undeniable, we should embrace the technology with governance and knowledge with regard to moral, legal, and social aspects to leverage on these capabilities.\n\nWe must navigate the complexities of AI ethically, understand the power of data analytics, and protect the privacy and security of the users to ride on the magic of AI.\n\nThere are guidelines and governance frameworks being developed, namely UNESCO's Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence and the EU's Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI. ASEAN has also published a guide on AI Governance and Ethics thsi year.\n\nMarkets around the world, namely the US, EU, China, Canada, and Australia, are stepping up on legal frameworks and AI regulations to emphasise ethical applications and social benefits as AI technology is shaping our future.", "source": {"uri": "vir.com.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vietnam Investment Review - VIR"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ASEAN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital transformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Information_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Information Services", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://vir.com.vn/stores/news_dataimages/2024/072024/11/16/in_social/ai-and-data-analytics-shaping-future-of-businesses-20240711161554.jpg?randTime=1720699393", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724323", "eventUri": "eng-9724323", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

We have supported and augmented the creative process, cut the time we spend on repetitive tasks, elevated the quality of our work, and freed ourselves up to focus on the higher-value ideation, execution, and strategic work that human beings do best.\n\nI talk in terms of \"we\" because after quite a bit of upfront information-gathering on my own (thank you, Marketing AI Institute and others!), I brought my team into the AI dialogue early to get their buy-in and input. That involved listening to their concerns, soliciting their ideas for how and where to deploy AI, and explaining the \"why\" behind AI -- the rationale and objectives for exploring it, how AI capabilities could benefit them in their work, and the critical role they would be playing in implementing, testing, and assessing an exciting and potentially game-changing technology.\n\nMy goal from the outset was to engage the team in pursuit of ways to apply AI that aligned with our business goals and would enhance outcomes for us individually, as a team, and as a company. It was about leveraging our team's skills, industry expertise, and understanding of our organizational business goals to guide how we explored and implemented AI. Instead of just seeking out the shiniest new AI tool and trying to shoehorn it into our operation, we focused on identifying use cases that would deliver real value and ROI to the team and the business, then finding the most suitable AI tools for those use cases. It was also about ensuring that everyone on the team understood that AI wasn't here to replace them, but rather to support them in their day-to-day work, so they treated it as a constructive tool, not a threat. Concerns about AI marginalizing the work we do as people are valid. Putting those concerns to rest within my team was a top priority early in our AI initiative.\n\nFrom initial due diligence to now, that AI journey has been eye-opening and rewarding. We've experienced nothing less than a paradigm shift in how we approach AI. Originally, we viewed it mostly as a tool to integrate around the edges to help us improve efficiency. Now, we see it as a core part of strategy development and execution, where we approach many challenges and tasks through the lens of how AI can help fuel creativity, reinvent processes, and augment, not replace, the higher value work we do. AI has become an intrinsic part of our day-to-day work. Following initial proof-of-concept evaluations in several targeted areas like content creation and video editing, we're consistently finding new applications for AI that support, sharpen, and enhance our work. And with them, our teamwide comfort with, and confidence in, AI keeps growing.\n\nAlong the way, we've picked up plenty of valuable insights about what it takes for a marketing team to successfully leverage AI -- insights other marketing teams may find helpful in their own AI journeys. Ours began with an open mind and a commitment to following a methodical implementation process. Where it ends -- who knows? Here's a look at how that process unfolded:\n\nStep 1: Identify specific areas of your marketing operation where AI can provide value by meeting a need or solving a problem. We sought AI use cases that would enhance the expertise of our team, make strategies more on-point, and elevate the creativity that fuels campaigns. We divided our use cases into six categories: campaigns and content; image and creative design; video development; predictions and insight; strategy; and product marketing. We then identified specific areas like copywriting and video production as the best initial use cases in which to test AI.\n\nMarketing Technology News: MarTech Interview with Roman Gun, Vice President, Product @ Zeta Global\n\nStep 2: Assess the available tools. Next, we began to evaluate the AI products that could work in the potential use cases we identified, assessing the quality of the platform and the provider (the latter is just as important as the former) based on the following:\n\nMeanwhile, as we were evaluating products and in advance of proof-of-concept testing those we found most promising, we had our legal and IT security teams vet the products we were considering to ensure they would comply with data protection laws as well as our own internal standards and requirements for AI ethics and governance (establishing and socializing these internal policies is another important early step in the process). We needed assurance that whatever tools we invested in would preserve the privacy and trust of our customers, and the confidentiality of our internal data.\n\nStep 3: Start piloting. Here's where things get fun: Seeing how AI performs in an actual pilot use case. We took a \"pilot before purchase\" approach, which enabled us to test several solutions, compare them side-by-side, and get a feel for each vendor's approach to support before committing to a specific solution and provider. We wanted a solution that would enable us to capture quick wins, that readily integrated with our existing martech stack, and that had capabilities we could scale to other marketing use cases (to lower the marginal cost associated with the AI investment).\n\nHaving chosen a generative AI-driven copywriting solution for our initial pilot, our team received training on the functions of the software to ensure we were using it correctly. When it comes to maximizing the value of AI software, we've learned that you don't necessarily need deep technical expertise to use it, but you do need training to use tools powered by genAI, machine learning, etc.\n\nThroughout the pilot, members of our team also made a point of sharing and documenting how we used the AI capabilities, our successes, challenges, and wins. We had plenty of back-and-forth with the provider's support team, and we stayed alert for opportunities to apply AI in other use cases, knowing that a pilot project can uncover other compelling AI applications we may not have considered.\n\nAs far as other best practices for piloting AI, we started small and didn't try to do too much too soon. We set up controlled experiments to test the software in a low-pressure environment where we could hopefully capture quick wins and, if not, fail fast, with minimal consequences, and learn from our missteps. I encouraged people to continue experimenting with the software, knowing some experiments would turn out better than others.\n\nStep 4: Track impact. We committed to measuring the performance of our new AI software against a set of predefined KPIs, like time savings, quality improvement, and, of course, campaign performance improvement. We gathered and analyzed user feedback and documented outcomes and best practices in order to refine our specific use cases and our broader AI rollout strategy.\n\nLike any technology, AI has to prove its value in a real business context. For us, it has done just that. We've sliced the time to create blog posts from existing content in half. We've developed new capabilities to quickly roll out email programs and to easily tailor existing campaign assets to specific verticals and customer personas. We've cut ad production time from two hours to 30 minutes. Because of wins like these -- and the ROI they are delivering -- we've invested in additional AI capabilities that we're deploying in a growing number of use cases.\n\nThe results have inspired confidence across our team in the AI tools themselves, and in our approach to implementing and using them. As a leader, this confidence is critical to building and sustaining a positive mindset about AI across your team.\n\nStage 5: Continuous learning. As successful as our AI journey has been, there's always more to learn, new tools and use cases to consider, and new value to capture. To those ends, we're developing ongoing, role-specific AI education and training for team members, providing people on the team with custom functional learning paths to reflect the different ways they use AI in their work. We regularly celebrate not just the wins but also the failed experiments that lead to learning.\n\nNow, deep into the second year of our AI journey, all our work on the front end is paying off, often in ways we didn't imagine when we first dipped our toe into the AI waters. The same can be true of your own organization's AI journey.

Along with promoting the development of the green economy, digital economy, circular economy, and sharing economy, Vietnam is determined to focus on developing high-value sectors, especially emerging fields at the moment, like AI,\" PM Chinh stated.\n\nIn its 2024 report evaluating the AI Readiness Index of 125 countries, the International Monetary Fund places Vietnam among the emerging countries that have not yet been immediately impacted by AI as developed nations have, with high exposure - high complementary and high exposure - low complementary rates about 40 per cent.\n\nWhile Vietnamese businesses have envisioned the application of AI since the mid-2000s, Vietnam currently has a significant advantage in AI development, according to Nguyen Quang Huy, director of data engineering at Techcombank.\n\n\"This advantage is bolstered by the return of a highly-skilled workforce, including experts and students trained and practised in AI abroad, due to the pandemic and political instability overseas. When global economic and political trends are volatile, the stable development environment in Vietnam becomes highly attractive to high-tech talent, not only among Vietnamese professionals but also international experts,\" Huy said.\n\nThe Vietnam Software and IT Services Association said at PM Chinh's conference in April on promoting economic diplomacy that Vietnam currently has one million IT engineers, nearly half of whom are ready to transition to the fields of AI and semiconductors.\n\nThe association added that Vietnam is holding a distinct advantage with a ready pool of high-quality software engineers who can be further trained in AI to develop AI applications. These applications can be used to automate processes in businesses and manufacturing, thereby increasing productivity and efficiency.\n\nRecognising AI's potential to drive economic growth, the government has implemented supportive policies like the national strategy on research and development (R&D) and application of AI, enhancing the application of AI in daily life.\n\nCompanies like Viettel Cybersecurity, FPT.AI, VinAI Research, and Neurond AI are at the forefront of developing innovative AI solutions across various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and logistics. In May, FPT.AI was named Outstanding Virtual Assistant 2023 by Software Reviews, an Info-Tech Research Group member, recognising FPT.AI's efforts over the past year in partnering with enterprises to create value in AI.\n\nMeanwhile, it is crucial to prepare for the rapid and significant impacts AI will bring, said Pham Thanh Hai, CEO of JobsGO. \"The time for AI to explode in Vietnam has arrived. However, some challenges persist in fully developing Vietnam's AI talents. A major issue is the shortage of skilled professionals, compounded by a lack of comprehensive educational programmes tailored to the AI industry's evolving needs. The qualifications of many graduates do not align with industry requirements, creating a talent gap that could impede the country's AI ambitions,\" said Hai.\n\n\"In terms of the AI engineering workforce, Vietnam lacks a competitive edge in deep research to build and train core models due to both talent shortages and financial constraints, training new models currently costs several hundreds of millions of US dollars each time. However, Vietnam stands to benefit in building AI products and applying AI within enterprises, automating processes, leveraging its pool of nearly 500,000 high-quality programmers, and a strong digital transformation movement. Vietnam may well pioneer a new trend of enterprise AI adoption,\" added Hai.\n\nTo effectively nurture its AI talent to drive future innovations, there are suggestions for Vietnam to focus on enhancing its educational programmes. \"The solution is now to provide continuous learning to the AI workforce, which means it does not stop at school, but also takes place in workplaces,\" said Huy of Techcombank. \"Furthermore, there is a need to ensure that our engineers are equipped with not only the good theory foundation, but also the practical skills necessary to apply AI to solving real-world problems. Organising AI competitions and hackathons can stimulate creativity and problem-solving among students and professionals.\"\n\nThe country's IT workforce, including over 400,000 professionals, is increasingly involved in AI-related fields such as data science and software development. This robust foundation has garnered significant investor interest, with projections indicating that Vietnam's digital economy could reach $43 billion by 2025, largely fuelled by advancements in AI technology, said Dr. Andy Le, AI expert at the Nanyang Technological University Alumni.\n\n\"Strengthening industry-academia collaboration is crucial. By fostering partnerships between tech companies and universities, Vietnam can ensure that academic training aligns with industry needs. Joint R&D projects and internships can facilitate knowledge transfer and innovation, giving students practical experience and exposure to real-world AI challenges,\" said Le.\n\nAddressing talent gaps and promoting inclusivity in AI education are crucial, he added. \"Focusing on skill development for high-demand areas such as AI engineering and data science will help bridge the talent gap. Ensuring that AI education and training programmes are accessible to a diverse range of students, including those from underrepresented groups, will create a more inclusive and robust AI talent pool,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "vir.com.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vietnam Investment Review - VIR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vietnam_investment_review@vir.com.vn", "name": "Vietnam Investment Review", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ph\u1ea1m_Minh_Ch\u00ednh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ph\u1ea1m Minh Ch\u00ednh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emerging market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharing_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sharing economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Circular economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Monetary Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Developed country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanyang_Technological_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nanyang Technological University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Reliability_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Reliability Engineering", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://vir.com.vn/stores/news_dataimages/2024/072024/11/16/in_social/time-is-now-for-vietnam-to-fully-cultivate-ai-talent-20240711162516.jpg?randTime=1720701065", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724323", "eventUri": "eng-9724323", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

The company alleges this model will rival ChatGPT-4 in its mathematical reasoning abilities.\n\nThe conference took place just before as OpenAI was banned in China, according to The Guardian:\n\nOpenAI has not elaborated about the reason for its sudden decision. ChatGPT is already blocked in China by the government's firewall, but until this week developers could use virtual private networks to access OpenAI's tools in order to fine-tune their own generative AI applications and benchmark their own research. Now the block is coming from the US side.\n\nRising tensions between Washington and Beijing have prompted the US to restrict the export to China of certain advanced semiconductors that are vital for training the most cutting-edge AI technology, putting pressure on other parts of the AI industry.\n\nBut executives like Zhang Ping'an, who leads Huawei's cloud computing function, seemed unfazed at the conference.\n\n\"Nobody will deny that we are facing limited computing power in China,\" Zhang said, according to Reuters. \"If we believe that not having the most advanced AI chips means we will be unable to lead in AI, then we need to abandon this viewpoint.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a new poll conducted by the AI Policy Institute and shared with TIME found that American voters would rather the U.S. worry less about keeping up with China's innovations and focus more on responsible AI.\n\nTime reports:\n\nAccording to the poll, 75% of Democrats and 75% of Republicans believe that \"taking a careful controlled approach\" to AI -- by preventing the release of tools that terrorists and foreign adversaries could use against the U.S. -- is preferable to \"moving forward on AI as fast as possible to be the first country to get extremely powerful AI.\" A majority of voters support more stringent security practices at AI companies, and are worried about the risk of China stealing their most powerful models, the poll shows.\n\nBut new technology is coming, even with a cautious approach. MIT Technology Review shared a deep dive into an evolving category of AI assistants, dubbed \"AI agents.\"\n\nWhile the definition of AI agents is somewhat ambiguous, Nvidia's AI agents initiative lead Jimmy Fan described them as tools that can make decisions autonomously on your behalf. In one of MIT's examples, an AI agent functions as a more advanced customer service bot that's able to analyze, cross-reference and evaluate the legitimacy of complaints.\n\nAccording to MIT Technology Review:\n\nIn a new paper, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, researchers at Princeton say that AI agents tend to have three different characteristics. AI systems are considered \"agentic\" if they can pursue difficult goals without being instructed in complex environments. They also qualify if they can be instructed in natural language and act autonomously without supervision. And finally, the term \"agent\" can also apply to systems that are able to use tools, such as web search or programming, or are capable of planning.\n\nOther AI tools continue to show potential for making all sorts of creative assets the average person may not be able to produce on their own. Consider Suno, an AI music creation app that allows you to create AI-generated tunes and is, as of this writing, still free to download (the startup was sued in June by a handful of record companies, so hard to say how long that will last).\n\nWashington Post tech reporter Chris Velazco recently detailed his experience with Suno, asking it to make a journalism-themed song for the storied paper that could serve as an update to John Phillips Souza's iconic \"Washington Post March.\"\n\nWhile a transformative tool like Suno has untold utility for communicators and marketers to create bespoke assets on the fly, looming legal threats raise the question of who will ultimately be holding the bag when the models that harvest copyrighted material are sue - the software companies or their clients?\n\nThe popular collaborative design tool Figma recently disabled its \"Make Design\" feature after it was accused of being trained on pre-existing apps, reports TechCrunch. YouTube also rolled out a policy change last week that lets people request AI-generated deepfakes that simulate their face or voice be removed, reports Engadget.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that many AI companies are focused on growing their customer base with lower-cost, less powerful models.\n\nThere's even a specific use-case for internal communications:\n\nThe key is focusing these smaller models on a set of data like internal communications, legal documents or sales numbers to perform specific tasks like writing emails -- a process known as fine-tuning. That process allows small models to perform as effectively as a large model on those tasks at a fraction of the cost.\n\nRisks and regulation\n\nFormer FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler appeared on Yahoo Finance's \"Catalysts\" show this week to say out that the U.S. has failed to lead on AI regulation efforts.\n\nYahoo Finance reports:\n\nHe notes that the EU and individual states in the US have their own set of rules, \"which will create new problems for those tech companies who rely on a uniform market.\" He explains that the way Europe regulates tech companies is a \"much more agile approach\" than industrial-era micromanagement, and it is an approach that \"continues to encourage innovation and investment.\" However, he believes the US will have a difficult time getting to that point as it grapples with \"a Congress that has a hard time making any decisions.\"\n\nSome states are moving forward with their own regulations in the absence of national guidance. The AP reports that last week, California advanced legislation requiring AI companies to test their systems and include safety features that protect the tools against weaponization.\n\nA growing coalition of tech companies argue the requirements would discourage companies from developing large AI systems or keeping their technology open-source.\n\n\"The bill will make the AI ecosystem less safe, jeopardize open-source models relied on by startups and small businesses, rely on standards that do not exist, and introduce regulatory fragmentation,\" Rob Sherman, Meta vice president and deputy chief privacy officer, wrote in a letter sent to lawmakers.\n\nOpponents want to wait for more guidance from the federal government. Proponents of the bill said California cannot wait, citing hard lessons they learned not acting soon enough to reign in social media companies.\n\nThe proposal, supported by some of the most renowned AI researchers, would also create a new state agency to oversee developers and provide best practices.\n\nIt's then no surprise that AI-related lobbying reached a record high over the past year, according to Open Secrets.\n\nThose hoping for some clarity or resolution would do best to work with your organization's leaders across functions and codify your own set of responsible AI guidelines instead of waiting for the government.\n\nAI at work\n\nMisuse of AI doesn't just affect external stakeholders, but the workforce, too. CIO reports on the rise of shadow AI, a term referring to unsanctioned AI use at work that puts sensitive company information and systems at risk.\n\nThe report cites numerous risks of unsanctioned AI use, including unskilled workers feeding tools sensitive data, disruptions among workers with various levels of competency and legal issues.\n\nSuffice it to say, training employees at all levels on responsible and acceptable use is a sound solution.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that chief information officers are seeing previously unheard-of compensation increases for increasingly taking on AI-related responsibilities.\n\nAccording to WSJ:\n\nCIO compensation increased 7.48% on average among large enterprises and 9% among midsize enterprises over the past year -- the biggest gains among information-technology job categories, according to salary data from consulting firm Janco Associates.\n\nOverall, CIO and chief technology officer compensation is up more than 20% since 2019, with boosts to base pay and, more often, equity packages, according to IT executive recruiting firm Heller Search Associates.\n\nThe gains indicate growing investment by enterprises in AI strategies and corporate tech leaders becoming more visible as they are increasingly tasked with new AI-related responsibilities.\n\n\"ChatGPT caught a lot of incumbent technology companies by surprise, and no organization wants to be left behind,\" said Shaun Hunt, CIO of Atlanta-based construction services firm McKenney's.\n\nIt's clear that AI is changing the game - for better and for worse.\n\nWhat trends and news are you tracking in the AI space?

Working with companies of all sizes to build amazing customer experiences, I see what the winners are doing.\n\nOne of the most important is moving past the old idea -- old as in, still popular just a couple of years ago -- that humans would maintain an edge in providing customers with \"empathy.\" In fact, AI is coming for empathy, and might even be better than humans at displaying it. A recent study conducted by USC professors Yidan Yin, Nan Jia, and Cheryl J. Wakslakfound found that AI-generated messages can help people feel more \"heard.\"\n\nThe more human-seeming AI tools become, the happier customers are interacting with these tools. Ultimately, what people want is a great experience. Few care much these days whether they're interacting with a real person; they care that their questions or issues be addressed quickly. I myself would often much rather chat with a robot than a person, since I expect the robot to be able to process more information more quickly with fewer mistakes.\n\nBut this does not mean that the role for people in dealing with customers is disappearing. It's changing. Successful organizations understand this, and are moving with the times.\n\nSo what are the roles for people when it comes to today's customer interactions? One of the most important involves being available to step in immediately when a customer conversation is going off track.\n\nIn this sense, a great sales representative becomes like a supervisor -- even if the person is entry level and has no actual employees they oversee. As AI tools chat with customers and try to help them, an individual sales rep is watching over.\n\nA color-coding system can be used to signal to the representative how well each conversation is going. Some organizations use traffic light colors. Green means that all is going well. Yellow indicates caution, that something is going wrong, and that the rep needs to step in. Red indicates that the customer has stopped responding, so the agent needs to try to get the conversation going again if possible.\n\nFor example, when a customer repeats a question, a yellow signal will appear, so the representative understands that the AI tool may not have provided an adequate answer. The same goes for the customer switching to all caps or using any terms that indicate frustration. AI tools are sophisticated and conduct live sentiment analysis, recognizing what this language indicates.\n\nAs the representative steps in to handle and improve the conversation, the AI \"watches.\" It learns what went wrong and how to solve a similar problem in the future.\n\nOver time, these tools get better, and the ratio expands -- that is, one human can go from overseeing perhaps three or four conversations, to 10, to perhaps even 50 at once, because the frequency of problems decreases.\n\nThe Human Edge On Complexity\n\nAt this point, I find that when humans are needed to step in, it's often because of complexity that AI does not yet understand. Customer relationships are more complex than ever, and sometimes people are needed to connect multiple dots. For example, a customer might refer to a previous technology that no longer exists or describe a problem using an analogy or expression that the AI doesn't understand.\n\nThis is also a great time for people to get involved because they're engaging in a much higher value conversation. Rather than reciting the same thing to hundreds of customers a day, representatives are able to use their creativity, knowledge and thinking skills to come up with new ideas and solutions to more complex problems.\n\nIn addition to learning from this, the AI also offers the representative help. It searches through the organization's data to find instances of other customers describing similar problems, and how they were resolved. It also searches all conversations that the organization has had with this customer across all channels -- from social media to phone, email and more -- to help the representative personalize the conversation. For example, it might prompt the representative to say, \"Last year, you bought X, and this product could be a great accompaniment to it.\"\n\nIt's true that these types of developments are leading to a time in which fewer sales representatives will be needed. But that's no reason to fret. New technologies always lead to new kinds of jobs. When I was growing up we had a milkman. These days, young people don't even know what one is. But when I was growing up, we did not have many of the jobs that exist today. Some of those milkmen are today's Amazon deliverers.\n\nSeeing how millions of people interact with companies that use AI-powered platforms, I'm confident that there will be plenty of new and changing roles for people inside organizations. In fact, the ones that do the best job of harnessing AI are most likely to succeed, creating the most jobs. The key is to view people and AI as a single team, helping each other maximize their success.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Empathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Customer experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sentiment analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_caps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All caps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Analogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edge (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frequency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customer relationship management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Lifestyle", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Lifestyle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/668e9c27547d84e9841c60cf/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724323", "eventUri": "eng-9724323", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

His articles and interviews with industry leaders have earned him recognition as a key influencer by organisations like Onalytica. Under his leadership, publications have been praised by analyst firms such as Forrester for their excellence and performance. Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry) or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\n\nWhile executives express high confidence in their organisations' AI capabilities, they simultaneously acknowledge significant barriers to further adoption.\n\nResearch from Zartis found that 85% of UK tech executives rate their existing workforce's combined AI knowledge and expertise as 'skilled', with over half (51%) considering it 'highly skilled'. This confidence, however, is juxtaposed against concerns about obstacles preventing wider AI implementation.\n\nAI adoption is nearly universal among UK tech companies, with 94% of executives reporting some form of AI use in their organisations. The remaining 6% are still in the exploration or research phase. Notably, not a single respondent claimed to be completely avoiding AI.\n\nIndustry pressure appears to be a significant factor driving AI adoption, with 40% of executives feeling compelled to prioritise AI investment due to widespread momentum around the technology.\n\nDespite the enthusiasm, several barriers hinder full AI adoption. Budget restrictions (41%), shortage of AI talent (38%), and technical complexity (35%) were cited as primary obstacles. Executives also expressed concerns about integration challenges (44%), cost and ROI uncertainty (42%), and data privacy and IP security (38%).\n\nMichal Szymczak, Head of AI Strategy at Zartis, commented on this apparent contradiction: \"AI adoption isn't some 'on or off' switch. To a lot of businesses, it involves a significant financial investment, and there are complex questions to grapple with surrounding data privacy, or integration with existing technology stacks. That makes executives' confidence in their company's AI skill set rather ironic. They puff their chests out, while simultaneously pointing to all the obstacles that could stop them in their tracks.\"\n\nThe financial aspect of AI adoption presents a mixed picture. While 42% of executives cited ROI uncertainty as a primary concern, 53% view cost savings through improved efficiency as one of the most significant long-term benefits of adopting AI.\n\nInvestment in AI capabilities is substantial, with 93% of companies spending at least \u00a3100,000 in 2024, and 44% allocating \u00a3500,000 or more. Software development emerges as the most popular area for AI investment (59%), followed by quality assurance (44%) and DevOps and automation (44%).\n\nAngel Benito, CTO at Zartis, offered insight into the investment trends: \"There is significant pressure on organisations to keep up with AI development or risk being left behind. This explains why many are investing despite the uncertainty about ROI. They see the potential for long-term cost savings but need a well-curated plan to implement the changes. It's crucial to understand that it's not just about the tools; it's about the people.\"\n\nAs companies navigate the AI landscape, their focus varies. The top three cited utilities of AI for software development are AI-powered copilot tools for coding (53%), improved continuous integration and deployment (52%), and enhanced team communication and collaboration (46%).\n\nThis study follows recent Zartis research indicating that over three-quarters of UK tech executives favour increased government oversight of AI, with many anticipating benefits from regulations such as the EU AI Act.\n\nAs the AI revolution continues to unfold, it's clear that UK tech companies are eager to embrace the technology, even as they grapple with its complexities and challenges.\n\nExplore other upcoming enterprise technology events and webinars powered by TechForge here.", "source": {"uri": "artificialintelligence-news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AI News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_daws@artificialintelligence-news.com", "name": "Ryan Daws", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrester_Research", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forrester Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief technology officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DevOps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quality assurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Continuous integration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Adoption", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Adoption", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/tech-executives-ai-adoption-skills-barriers-artificial-intelligence-research-report-study.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724323", "eventUri": "eng-9724323", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

While ChatGPT and various copilots have been a start, the next real leap forward in AI is coming around the corner with the introduction of AI agents. These autonomous software systems can reason, make decisions and take action to pursue goals, going beyond just providing insights or generating content.\n\nAI agents represent the next major wave of transformation that will reshape industries by automating complex workflows, optimizing decision-making and unlocking new levels of efficiency.\n\nWith the excitement surrounding AI, it seems like every application now has a bolted-on copilot feature. While these copilots may bring marginal efficiency gains, they can be difficult to quantify. Similarly, new AI search applications allow users to ask questions about data, but people are not always great at asking the right questions, putting the burden on the user. Countless new upstarts are competing to build personal assistant agents, but these open-ended \"AI helpers\" often fall into the same trap and may not stick in the long run.\n\nThe core problem with chat, copilot, search and AI helpers is that their value is buried and they don't fundamentally change how we do knowledge work. This is where agents are different.\n\nInstead of making people more efficient, agents can execute work for them, allowing people to focus on higher-value thinking. To truly harness the power of AI agents, it's crucial to focus on tightly defined use cases with well-specified work products. These can be anything that knowledge workers produce today: a completed employee onboarding, a new social media update or a fully reconciled invoice ready for the accounts payable team.\n\nWell-documented business processes and standard operating procedures (SOPs) are excellent starting points for AI agents. If you have an area with clearly defined operating principles, you can turn those guidelines into instructions for an agent. This allows you to map agents against inputs and outcomes, ensuring that you can measure the effectiveness of the agent and, over time, improve its performance, leading to greater success.\n\nAnother way to think about agent use cases is to look at outside-in and inside-out perspectives. From an outside-in perspective, customer support, customer service and sales outreach are potential areas for agent deployment.\n\nWhile automating high-touch, high-volume customer-facing tasks is appealing, it comes with more risk, especially if an agent is interacting directly with customers. Starting with an inside-out perspective and focusing on internal operations such as finance, HR, sales and marketing is less risky because internal employees can be first trained to work with an agent.\n\nCompliance is a critical area for many industries, and an AI agent can help ensure that your organization stays up to date with the latest regulations, avoiding costly penalties and reputational damage. This agent produces timely reports on changes in regulatory updates, such as export controls, and allows users to query them.\n\nIt searches through customer accounts to see recent impacts, saving time on monitoring and creating update reports. By estimating potential savings on noncompliance issues and time saved on compliance reporting, you can demonstrate the agent's value.\n\nOnboarding is an important process for any organization, as it sets the tone for an employee's experience and can impact retention. An AI agent can streamline this process, ensuring that new hires have a smooth and efficient onboarding experience while reducing the administrative burden on HR staff. This agent automates the end-to-end onboarding process, including creating accounts for company systems and engaging with hiring managers to complete processes.\n\nComplex invoice reconciliation work has rules and standard operating procedures that can be turned into agent workflows. Manually scrutinizing a 30-page invoice and matching it against internal systems might take hours for a human, but agents can free up this time for more productive work.\n\nBy measuring the number of invoices successfully reconciled by the agent, you can track its effectiveness. This workflow is easy to expand to upstream and downstream agents, creating a more comprehensive financial management solution.\n\nSocial media teams are always on the lookout for fresh content by monitoring competitors, customers, analysts and industry leaders to stay ahead of the curve and create more relevant and engaging content for your audience.\n\nThis agent creates timely suggestions for social media posts and reactions. It understands the company, brand and the purpose of the post (engagement, followers or conversion) to optimize content accordingly. While marketers still make the call to post, the agent serves as a valuable source of ideas. By measuring the growth of selected metrics (engagement, followers, signups, leads), marketing teams can gauge its success.\n\nCustomer support teams, across any industry, will use information from multiple systems to understand customer behavior and resolve customer issues. An AI agent can pull together a view of the customer from all relevant systems that customer support agents could query.\n\nThis can shorten call times and improve customer satisfaction by providing faster and more accurate support while reducing the workload on human agents. It can also provide tools for resolving common customer issues like easily returning items based on previous purchases. By measuring the time saved in each customer contact, you can quantify the agent's impact.\n\nAs we continue to explore the potential of AI agents in the enterprise, it's essential to focus on well-defined use cases that deliver measurable results by enhancing efficiencies, reducing risk or improving time to revenue. By starting with these top five use cases -- or similar ones that fit your organization -- and expanding gradually, organizations can unlock the true power of AI agents to drive efficiency, compliance and revenue growth.\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

It will free employees from menial tasks to focus on high-value interactions. It will enable brands to deliver humanity at scale. As excitement over artificial intelligence technology has reached ubiquity, so too have these promises of customer service transformation. Thought leaders have been trumpeting AI to answer customer service woes - a way to achieve the ever-elusive duality of efficiency and customer-centricity. Unfortunately, these promises have not yet come to fruition. In fact, the rise of AI has coincided with a regression in customer experience quality.\n\nAccording to a recent market study on CX trends, challenges, and opportunities, 55% of consumers feel experiences have worsened over the past year. The overwhelming majority say experiences remain devoid of convenience, personalization, empathy, and simplicity. Also, in a sobering commentary on the state of AI, customers identify the inability to access a human agent and unhelpful automation platforms as the two most significant pain points in customer service. However, savvy business leaders will not let these statistics shake their faith in AI's potential. Instead, they will treat them as a call to adopt a more customer- and employee-centric approach to AI. Companies will stop focusing on what AI theoretically could do and prioritize what it should and must do within the customer contact operation.\n\nStop imposing AI on customers\n\nYes, AI-driven chatbots can provide a more complete, resolute self-service experience. They can empower customers to address inquiries and transactions without waiting for live agent assistance. That does not mean businesses should immediately or aggressively deploy chatbots throughout customer journeys.\n\nDue to poor past experiences with self-service platforms, only 17% of consumers are confident that they can solve their problems in chatbots. If brands do not address this lack of trust before forcing customers into self-service experiences, they will be uninterested in honoring customer preferences. Customers, moreover, will resist engaging with these bots - pursuing immediate (and inefficient) escalations to a live agent in the best case and switching to a competitor in the worst case. Either way, the brand will not see meaningful growth in chatbot adoption, preventing it from reducing inbound contact volume or at least collecting data it can use to optimize future experiences.\n\nInstead of forcing customers into chatbots before they are ready, brands should identify the specific use cases for which bots are superior and then educate customers on this opportunity. By helping customers see the value (whether in terms of resolution quality or time savings) they can get from bots, brands will change the narrative. Ultimately, bots will be seen as a source of empowerment rather than deflection.\n\nTaking an outside-in approach to AI use cases\n\nTo build trust in automated engagement options, focusing on the proper use cases is essential. Generally, AI will better suit \"simple issues\" than highly complex ones. A common mistake, however, involves defining these \"simple issues\" from an internal perspective. Far too many businesses focus on the inefficient, repetitive, or \"boring\" tasks that they hope today's AI technology can sufficiently handle. They do not consider whether AI should handle these issues.\n\nAn issue that is \"simple,\" \"boring,\" and \"repetitive\" to a seasoned contact center employee may still feel confusing, high-stakes, and personal to a customer. Suppose the customer has to ask and answer an egregious amount of questions and exerts considerable effort only to receive an inadequate resolution. In that case, they will not be happy with the chatbot experience. They will not feel that they were \"empowered\" to avoid waiting on hold for a \"simple issue.\" Instead, they will feel like the brand forced them to waste time on a matter that could have been solved more quickly and completely by a human employee. When identifying appropriate chatbot use cases, it is essential to listen to the voice of the customer. Rather than making their determinations about \"simple issues,\" successful brands will evaluate customer feedback and behavioral analytics to determine the true intentions behind their inquiries - and whether a chatbot or a live agent would best serve those intentions.\n\nUncomplicating escalation\n\nTheoretically capable of addressing many frontline customer service issues, AI-driven chatbots can substitute live agents. This possibility can justify decisions to reduce headcounts or restrict access to human support. Brands that want to win customer trust should not let the emergence of AI mark the extinction of live agent assistance. Customers label difficulty accessing a live agent as the number one pain point impacting their experiences with brands. Meanwhile, they say the promise of easy escalation would be the most effective way to get them to try chatbots.\n\nWhether customers believe their issue is too complex, want personalized guidance, seek to hold someone accountable, or believe it will result in a better resolution, consumers value having a real person on the other line. By continuing to provide individuals with accessible, immediate pathways to these live agents, businesses will symbolically communicate their appreciation for that customer. They will show a willingness to stand behind their products and experiences and a desire to develop meaningful, supportive relationships.\n\nBrands should encourage customers to give AI-driven chatbots a try because when customers see these as a pathway to either get a quick resolution or simplify the process of reaching a live agent, they will have every reason to at least start their interaction in an automated environment. They will experience AI as innovators have intended: to enhance customer interactions. Granted, empowering escalations is not simply about providing a simple button or prompt for requesting a live agent. It is also about ensuring that relevant context from the conversation moves with the customer so that the receiving agent already knows details of whom and what they are supporting. The second the agent asks the customer to repeat something shared in the bot is the second the escalation process - and faith in AI's viability as an entry point - goes out the window.\n\nTaking \"agent empowerment\" seriously\n\nThe idea of using \"AI for simple issues so that agents can focus on complex ones\" is an immensely appealing dichotomy. It enables businesses to improve cost efficiency and ensure agents focus on the more diverse, enriching, thought-provoking work that tends to produce more job satisfaction and loyalty. Unfortunately, the promise of this dichotomy blinds many contact center leaders to an important reality: they are not actually empowering agents to thrive at complex work.\n\nDue to unintuitive, disconnected systems, the majority of contact center leaders impose far too much operational difficulty on their agents. As agents exert undue effort accessing different interfaces, searching for knowledge, looking up customer data, or completing post-call work, they need to develop consultative relationships with customers. Unsurprisingly, fewer than 25% of consumers feel the typical contact center agent comes across as focused or knowledgeable. The consequences of this effort, notably, are coming when agents are still primarily handling simple issues that they should know. As they truly pivot to complex work - and are positioned as \"experts\" who can solve the problems chatbots cannot - they will rely even more heavily on internal knowledge, data, and support. Without first remedying internal frustration points, brands are setting agents up for catastrophic failure.\n\nOf course, improving internal systems is only part of the battle. Presently, only 16% of contact center leaders believe their agents have the skills needed for next-generation, consultative engagement. Without quickly and successfully upskilling these agents, they are dooming them to underperform for customers who may already be carrying frustration from underwhelming bot interactions. AI technology can, thankfully, solve these problems. Solutions related to intelligent knowledge management, real-time agent assistance, call summarization, and personalized coaching will help agents focus more intently on customer interactions and gather the expertise and actionable intelligence needed to deliver exceptional experiences.\n\nThe key is to pursue these use cases before eagerly shifting agents to a more complex work slate. If agents are not truly empowered to handle the responsibilities of an AI-driven world, they will not enjoy any day-to-day benefits. The business, meanwhile, will fail to reap the rewards of greater agent satisfaction and productivity.\n\nMoving forward: let AI live up to its potential\n\nRhetorically, customer contact leaders are quick to defend AI against skepticism. They have noted that it will augment rather than replace agents. They have stressed that it will increase rather than eliminate humanity from customer interactions. Practically, their actions justify the skepticism. As they deploy AI at scale, they are simultaneously restricting customer access to live agents. They are doing nothing to enhance the capabilities of the agents who are still available to answer customer inquiries. As a result, customers encounter unhelpful bots and work tirelessly to find escalation options, only to deal with agents who lack the context, expertise, or empathy needed to prove better support. Is it any wonder the majority feel experiences are getting worse?\n\nTo reverse course, contact center leaders must recommit to AI as a source of value rather than deflection. They should use bots to simplify experiences for those who believe in self-service and expedite escalations for those who want live agents. They should use internal automation to free agents from the hindrances of everyday contact center work and focus on customer connections. They should stop asking which processes they could automate and focus on which aspects of the experience they should elevate.", "source": {"uri": "thefastmode.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thefastmode.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Use case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Self-service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Customer experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queue (abstract data type)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_centre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Call centre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowerment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Empowerment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Empathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customer data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knowledge management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skepticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet bot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Agents", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Agents", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Agents", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Agents", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Agents", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Agents", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Consulting", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.thefastmode.com/media/k2/items/src/fbc599c5c51718f1efc38f4e30645d9f.jpg?t=20240708_025147", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724323", "eventUri": "eng-9724323", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The global study Industrial AI: the new frontier for productivity, innovation and competition involved 1,700 senior decision makers from Manufacturing, Telecommunications, Aerospace & Defense, Services, Construction & Engineering, and Energy & Resources companies. It found that optimism about artificial intelligence (AI) is a direct indicator of AI strategy maturity within their business. The study found firms between $200-$500m the most optimistic about AI, while the UK and USA were the least optimistic countries.\n\nThe IFS Global AI Optimism League Table by Country\n\nThe IFS Global AI Optimism League Table by Company Size\n\nAn easy assumption to make with AI is that the more financial resources available, the more optimism there would be about what could be done with AI. However, the research reveals that businesses with revenues of over $500 Million ranked only third in terms of optimism due to a clear polarization in strategy, data readiness, and skills. Indeed, the polarization in AI readiness has led to 25% of this group believing AI benefits will materialize within 12 months, while the laggards don't expect to see benefits for at least three years. Large enterprises showed the widest gaps in time to benefits of any of the company size groups surveyed.\n\nIn contrast, the survey revealed mid-sized ($50-$200m) firms being less optimistic about AI purely because they have fewer resources and skills to deploy to the technology today, and therefore are planning over a longer period of time to drive benefits from a maturing technology.\n\nChristian Pedersen, Chief Product Officer, IFS, commented: \"At the surface level, the lack of optimism across some respondents may suggest we are at the edge of a trough of disillusionment, particularly following the all-encompassing hype that AI enjoyed for much of the last 18 months. What we are actually witnessing is enterprises differentiating themselves with AI. Organizations that have established a strong data foundation, invested in skills, and embedded sustainability into their strategy are optimistic because they can see the benefits coming into view quickly. It is vital that leaders see AI as a strategy, not a tool.\"\n\nDelving into what fuels optimism around AI, the research suggests that companies' architectural readiness directly correlates with their overall optimism about the technology. Respondents who report being more architecturally ready are more likely to be optimistic about AI. This indicates that companies with a strong cloud-based foundation are further along in their AI journeys and are most likely to believe that the tangible benefits of AI will become a reality sooner.\n\nPedersen continued: \"We see direct evidence from our research that the market is splitting into those who have embraced AI and those who have not. There is an element of 'following the herd' fueling the board's desire for AI programs. McKinsey has found that AI could be the key to unlocking an additional $4.4 trillion in corporate profits per year, which is building pressure to adopt it. Without a clear direction and strategy, AI programs stall, making the end result seem further away than it needs to be.\"\n\nEmergence of Industrial AI for productivity, innovation and sustainability\n\nInnovative products and services (31%) and data accessibility (30%) are the most common areas senior decision-makers expect AI to make large differences, followed closely by cost reductions (29%). Interestingly, at a country level, the USA (32%) and Germany (31%) were the only nations most likely to believe that AI will lead to consistent business growth.\n\nThe survey reveals a positive correlation between skills and AI optimism. The nations most likely to identify as having invested heavily in skills for several years are generally more optimistic about AI overall. France (49%), UAE (53%), Norway (48%), Australia (46%), Sweden (46%) and Japan (45%) are leading the way here.\n\nSustainability planning also correlates directly with overall AI optimism. The less wide-ranging a country's sustainability strategy was with regard to AI, the less likely they were to be optimistic about AI in general. UK (5%), Canadian (6%), Danish (6%) and Finnish (4%) respondents were least likely to have an AI strategy for sustainability in place and all feature in the bottom half of the optimism league table.\n\n\"The lofty expectations for AI bely a fundamental misunderstanding of how it is supposed to drive value. The real power lies in Industrial AI, where data flows through every part of your business, combining structured, interlinked datasets to uncover insights, optimize every process and marry the digital with the physical world. That's where the true value lies. If a business doesn't have a strategy to reach that point, then they need a partner who can guide them on that journey,\" concluded Pedersen.\n\nDiscover more insights and actions in the Industrial AI: the new frontier for productivity, innovation and competition Executive Report.\n\nCensuswide surveyed 1,709 C-level/President/SVP/Directors who work in Manufacturing, Telecommunications, A&D, Services, Construction & Engineering or Energy & resources in organizations with $50m+ annual revenue (Aged 18+) across the UK, USA, Canada, Germany, France, UAE, Norway, Japan, Australia, Sweden, Denmark and Finland.\n\nIFS develops and delivers cloud enterprise software for companies around the world who manufacture and distribute goods, build and maintain assets, and manage service-focused operations.

Armed with this novel technology, brands can now move away from one-to-many marketing campaigns and instead focus their efforts on creating hyper-personalised customer experiences. We're calling this shift the age of individualisation.\n\nThrough surveys of business leaders and consumers alike, we gained valuable insights into how brands are leveraging AI to enhance customer interactions, alongside how customers expect businesses to engage with them in 2024 and beyond. From our research results, we uncovered a number of key priorities for brands. here are three key findings.\n\nPutting customer engagement at the forefront\n\nIt's official: AI is redefining customer engagement. 70% of businesses say they're already using AI to customise content and marketing, suggesting that those who haven't yet turned to AI-powered solutions are potentially missing out.\n\nBy harnessing the power of AI, companies can gain deeper insights into customer behaviour, preferences, and needs, allowing them to adapt their offerings and communications accordingly for greater engagement.\n\nFor example, Banking app Chime connected their AI-powered interactive voice (IVR) solution to the customer data pipeline, enabling deeper analysis of customer trends that led to a 12% increase in customer satisfaction.\n\nPowering greater personalisation\n\nWith 76% of businesses saying personalised customer engagement is a high or critical priority in 2024, it's clear that greater personalisation is not just a nice-to-have; it's now a business imperative.\n\nBy seamlessly integrating data tools and technologies with AI, businesses can improve the customer experience across multiple touchpoints, from social media interactions to customer service inquiries. Tailoring your marketing can have a significant impact on the bottom line through improving loyalty and retention rates - and can even drive new customer conversions.\n\nUsing Twilio Segment, IBM Cloud created machine learning models to recommend tailored solutions and use data to proactively reach users with 1:1 product messaging. As a result of these personalisation efforts, the Cloud team increased product adoption by 30% and revenue by 70%.\n\nOvercoming the obstacles of AI\n\nHowever, while AI presents exciting opportunities for businesses, it also comes with its own set of hurdles. 40% of businesses said finding a balance between security and customer experience will be one of their most pressing challenges in 2024, with data privacy concerns continuing to be a major issue.\n\nConsumers are demanding greater transparency and control over their personal information. As businesses collect and analyse vast amounts of customer data to power their AI systems, they must prioritise data privacy and security to build and maintain trust with their customers.\n\nOne way to do this is with a customer data platform (CDP).

Omary, MD, MS, Vanderbilt University Medical Center", "body": "This is an overview of trends and technologies in radiology artificial intelligence (AI) applications in 2021. Views were shared by 11 radiologists using AI and industry leaders, which include:\n\n* Randy Hicks, M.D., MBA, radiologist and CEO of Reginal Medical Imaging (RMI), and an iCAD Profound AI user.\n\n* Prof. Dr. Thomas Frauenfelder, University of Zurich, Institute for Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, and Riverain AI user.\n\n* Amy Patel, M.D., medical director of Liberty Hospital Women's Imaging, assistant professor of radiology at UMKC, and user of Kios AI for breast ultrasound.\n\n* Sham Sokka, Ph.D., vice president and head of innovation, precision diagnosis, Philips Healthcare.\n\n* Ivo Dreisser, Siemens Healthineers, global marketing manager for the AI Rad Companion.\n\n* Bill Lacey, vice president of medical informatics, Fujifilm Medical Systems USA.\n\n* Karley Yoder, vice president and general manager, artificial intelligence, GE Healthcare.\n\n* Georges Espada, head of Agfa Healthcare digital and computed radiography business unit.\n\n* Sebastian Nickel, Siemens Healthineers, global product manager for the AI Pathway Companion.\n\nThere has been a change in attitudes about AI on the expo floor at the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) over the last two years. AI conversations were originally 101 level and discussed how AI technology could be trained to sort photos of dogs and cats. However, in 2020, with numerous FDA approvals for various AI applications, the conversations at RSNA, and industry wide, have shifted to that of accepting the validity of AI. Radiologists now want to discuss how a specific AI algorithm is going to help them save time, make more accurate diagnoses and make them more efficient.\n\nWith a higher level of maturity in AI and the technology seeing wider adoption, radiologists using it say AI gives them additional confidence in their diagnoses, and can even help readers who may not be deep experts in the exam type they are being asked to read.\n\nWith a myriad of new AI apps gaining regulatory approval from scores of imaging vendors, the biggest challenge for getting this technology into hospitals is an easy to integrate format. This has led to several vendors creating AI app stores. These allow AI apps to integrate easily into radiology workflows because the apps are already integrated as third-party software into a larger radiology vendors' IT platform.\n\nThere are now hundreds of AI applications that do a wide variety of analysis, from data analytics, image reconstruction, disease and anatomy identification, automating measurements and advanced visualization. The AI applications can be divided into 2 basic types -- AI to improve workflow, and AI for clinical decision support, such as diagnostic aids.\n\nOn the workflow side, several vendors are leveraging AI to pull together all of a patients' information, prior exams and reports in one location and to digest the information so it is easier for the radiologist to consume. Often the AI pulls only data and priors that relate to a specific question being asked, based on the imaging protocol used for the exam. One example of this is the Siemens Healthineers AI Clinical Pathway and Siemens AI integrations with PACS to automate measurements and advanced visualization.\n\nAI is also helping simplify complex tasks and help reduce the reading time on involved exams. One example of this is in 3-D breast tomosythesis with hundreds of images, which is rapidly replacing 2-D mammography, which only produces 4 images. Another example is automated image reconstruction algorithms to significantly reduce manual work. AI also is now being integrated directly into several vendors' imaging systems to speed workflow and improve image quality.\n\nVendors say AI is here to stay. They explain the future of AI will be automation to help improve image quality, simplify manual processes, improved diagnostic quality, new ways to analyze data, and workflow aids that operate in the background as part of a growing number of software solutions.\n\nSeveral vendors at RSNA 2020 noted that AI's biggest impact in the coming years will be its ability to augment and speed the workflow for the small number of radiologists compared to the quickly growing elder patient populations worldwide. There also are applications in rural and developing countries were there are very low numbers of physicians or specialists.\n\nAI Outperforms Humans in Creating Cancer Treatments, But Do Doctors Trust

While overall hiring activity across 50 of the world's largest banks is down 23% year-on-year, Evident's latest AI Talent Report shows that there has been no let-up in the drive to bring in dedicated AI talent, as banks find themselves under immense pressure to harness AI technologies and deliver 'more with less'.\n\nThe report examines the central role that talent is playing in the AI transformation of the banking industry, as banks look to recruit, upskill and retain the roles and skill sets necessary to deploy AI at scale. Evident reveals that the 50 banks tracked in the Evident AI Index added almost 10,000 net new AI roles (9,238) and posted 17,836 AI-related job descriptions between Q4 2023 and Q1 2024.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPMC) and Capital One lead the AI talent race based on existing talent capability, new roles added between Q3 2023 and Q1 2024, and remaining open job vacancies. Wells Fargo has added the greatest number of new AI roles other than JPMC, but appears to have slowed its hiring efforts. Citigroup's open AI job roles are outpacing Bank of America by 2.8x, as the bank looks to catch up to its rival. While UBS leads Europe in talent volume following its merger with Credit Suisse, the bank has added the fewest additional roles over the past six months of any bank in Evident's Top 10 leaderboard. Recent job openings have also trended lower than peers. By contrast, HSBC has posted 30% more open AI roles than its immediate European peers between Oct 2023 and April 2024.\n\nAlexandra Mousavizadeh, co-founder and CEO of Evident, comments: \"After a brutal wave of layoffs, AI investment is viewed by the banks as the panacea that will allow them to bring about the needed productivity gains from their remaining workforce. \"By analysing the AI talent the banks are bringing in, we can determine which institutions are best placed to make these gains a reality. JPMorgan Chase and Capital One are the trailblazers. They're laying down the blueprint for others by addressing AI talent strategy across multiple time horizons -- balancing what they need today versus what they'll need tomorrow, and recognising both the need to bring in external AI talent, as well as the need to retrain and upskill existing employees for the challenge ahead.\"\n\nUK and European banks step up the pace of AI hiring\n\nThe overall pool of banking AI talent has grown particularly in Europe between Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, with the UK banks growing most quickly (+12% increase in AI roles), followed by the rest of Europe (+11%), and then the US (+10%). Among the European banks, Deutsche Bank and Santander have increased AI headcount fastest, alongside Barclays, HSBC, and BNP Paribas, which are together responsible for driving the growth trends seen in the UK and Europe.\n\nRetraining and upskilling is needed given the shortage of available AI talent\n\nWith a persistent talent shortfall in the AI labour market for the foreseeable future, the Evident AI Talent report also reveals a continuing effort among the world's biggest banks to retrain and upskill existing talent for the AI adoption journey ahead. According to Evident, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Capital One, DBS, and JPMorgan Chase are among the standout performers for their current AI talent development practices. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale was the only bank to achieve a perfect score across training and career development in the most recent Evident AI Index.\n\nAI talent development best practices revealed\n\nIn order to implement AI at scale, banks are actively focusing on four areas of AI talent development:\n\n1. Long-term resource planning: thinking about the strategic workforce plan across multiple time horizons.\n\n2. Group-wide onboarding for technical talent (\"builders\"): supporting the high level of AI graduates joining (60% of all incoming AI talent) with training programmes that establish a shared baseline for incoming \"builders\", so they can quickly add value regardless of where they ultimately work across the wider organisation.\n\n3. Upskilling and educating both \"leaders\" and \"users\": looking beyond \"builders\" to the rest of the bank, whether training \"leaders\" in AI literacy, or upskilling and educating the ultimate \"users\" of promising AI tools and applications.\n\n4. Balancing central coordination with decentralised training: recognising that Group-level orchestration of AI talent development is aspirational, and decentralised training may be needed when addressing talent across the naturally siloed lines of business found at most banks.\n\nMousavizadeh adds: \"The race for AI adoption isn't over, but talent remains a critical driver of future success, and banks need to adopt a comprehensive view of AI talent that helps evolve the organisation at every level.\n\n\"Alongside sourcing technical talent through hiring or retraining, banks must also look at how to educate their leaders around AI strategy and communicate it effectively, set up incoming technical AI talent for future success, and upskill and educate their wider workforce who will be using these tools - this is ultimately where AI ROI will be determined.\"\n\nEvident is a benchmarking and intelligence platform that aims to provide the most authoritative source of data-driven insights on how companies are adopting AI. Beginning with banking, Evident has created the first independent benchmark for tracking industry-wide AI adoption and readiness.

Businesses should now consider AI CRM platforms as the new table stakes.\n\nIn my 30-year career working in the IT industry, no technology has progressed as quickly as AI. In just a few years, we're witnessing that practical, utility-based applications that directly impact CRM users are making a huge, positive difference. When deployed strategically, sales professionals can let AI handle necessary but mundane admin tasks while allowing sales professionals to strategically focus on aspects of the sales cycle that rely on the talents, ingenuity and emotional understanding of humans.\n\nBy harnessing AI's capabilities, companies can achieve unprecedented levels of efficiency, personalization and predictive accuracy, gaining valuable time for focusing on tasks that require a human touch, namely one-on-one customer interactions. As AI-driven CRM platforms evolve, they promise to unlock new opportunities for sales professionals in a hyper-competitive and over-saturated sales market.\n\nAI can revolutionize a CRM, driving your business toward greater success and customer satisfaction through personalization, automation, analytics and forecasting.\n\nSales professionals juggle multiple contacts at different stages of the funnel at all given times. Communicating with each on a personal level is crucial to success but time-consuming. Generative AI can help tailor personalized customer interactions, whether by email or text, by instantly changing the tone of a message, writing emails faster and without error and shortening or lengthening a message across languages. Next-gen CRM solutions have this AI built right into the platform rather than linking out to AI-powered resources like ChatGPT, which is ideal, helping to eliminate distractions and errors caused by switching between windows and platforms.\n\nWithout automation, sales professionals might lose valuable hours to rote administrative tasks that are necessary but detract from time spent communicating with leads and customers. AI can help automate some tasks, such as audience segmentation, appointment scheduling and nurtured content campaigns. The ROI on setting up automation is clear, with a report from McKinsey & Co. finding that early adopters of sales automation \"consistently report increases in customer-facing time, higher customer satisfaction, efficiency improvements of 10 to 15 percent, and sales uplift potential of up to 10 percent.\"\n\nWhen well-maintained, CRM platforms host abundant data, especially regarding customer interactions. AI algorithms can analyze this data to derive information about customer sentiment and performance issues, as well as to find patterns and make predictions that can shape how you continue fostering customer relationships. For example, the AI would be able to identify how many touch points the average customer needs and which messaging is most effective in helping to close the deal.\n\nAccurate sales forecasting is essential for business planning and resource allocation. AI can enhance the precision of sales forecasts by analyzing historical sales data, market trends and even external factors such as economic indicators. This enables companies to anticipate trends and shifts in the market and modify their plans appropriately. Additionally, by locating bottlenecks in the current sales process, AI can recommend the best way to effectively manage the sales funnel to close prospective deals.\n\nWhile the benefits of AI in CRM are substantial, businesses that utilize AI technology need to consider the implications on data security and customer privacy. First and foremost, this means complying with regulations that protect customer information. Even if these regulations lag, businesses should implement policies to protect the customer regardless. Additionally, transparency is needed to avoid biases and ensure fair treatment of customers. All of this should be communicated to customers with details and insights that are easily accessible to ensure they're always fully informed of your business practices.\n\nThe benefits of AI for CRM are plenty but implementing any new technology comes with challenges. First, there's the cost to consider. While some CRM platforms integrate AI technology directly within the user experience, many still link to third-party solutions. The more integrated the AI is within your tech stack, the more seamless the experience will be.\n\nNew technology also comes with a learning curve. Despite the myriad benefits you and your team may expect from your new AI solution, success comes with patience. Training may be needed to best interact with and leverage your new AI solution.\n\nAI is also only as good as the data it's trained on. If your customer data is old, missing valuable info or has too many duplicates, your AI won't be able to produce the quality results you may be expecting. We've seen that a data cleanse is a vital step to take before implementing AI solutions.\n\nThe benefits of AI-powered CRMs are clear, but there's a delicate balance to consider. Too much AI can remove the essential human touch needed to build authentic, successful customer relationships and can lead to a manufactured approach to customer interactions that comes across as disingenuous and off-putting to customers. Sales teams should seek out a balance between automation that augments the sales process and creates efficiencies that allow sales professionals to lean into the human-centric aspects of the job. This balanced approach ensures that AI technology enhances customer relations rather than replacing the process, allowing sales teams to leverage the valuable insights that come with AI without sacrificing customer engagement.\n\nAI is revolutionizing the way businesses manage customer relationships. By leveraging AI-powered CRMs, businesses can transform their CRM systems into powerful engines of growth, delivering superior customer experiences and achieving a competitive advantage. As AI technology continues to evolve, its use in customer relationship management and the overall sales cycle will only become more integral, making it essential for businesses to embrace these solutions early on to stay ahead of the curve.\n\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

Once the (staggered) implementation period expires, providers of AI systems - especially those that are considered 'high-risk AI systems' - will have to comply with a wide range of legal requirements. One of the key instruments for implementing these requirements will be standards. This blog post explores whether and how ISO 42001 may be utilised to meet some of the key AI Act requirements.\n\nIn sum, while the ISO 42001 standard requires a number of measures similar to those prescribed by the AI Act, the latter is often more specific. While adhering to the ISO standard will often be helpful to ensure compliance with laws including the AI Act (and in some cases might actually suffice), this may lead competent authorities to consider that ISO-compliance does not equal AI Act-compliance, even to the extent there are overlapping requirements.\n\n1. Overlapping requirements, different focus\n\nThe ISO standard differs from the AI Act conceptually, and in respect of legal quality: Whereas ISO 42001 is a non-binding standard focused on AI management and governance within an organisation, the AI Act is a binding regulation focused on product safety. Nonetheless, ISO 42001 can be a helpful starting point for approaching AI compliance.\n\nTaking the practical example of record-keeping, the AI Act requires that high-risk AI systems allow for the automatic recording of events (logs) over their lifetime to ensure traceability of the functioning of the system. Similarly, under ISO 42001, organisations should ensure logging for AI systems they deploy to automatically collect and record event logs related to certain events that occur during operation. Under ISO 42001 this can include, among others, information on the time and date of the system's use, which is also required under the AI Act for certain AI systems.\n\nHowever, the focus of the logging requirement is different under both instruments and compared to the AI Act, ISO 42001 is less detailed. In particular, the AI Act specifically requires logging capabilities to enable identifying situations that may result in the high-risk AI systems presenting a risk to health, safety and fundamental rights and facilitating post-market monitoring. The AI Act requirement is mandatory for high-risk AI systems throughout the lifetime of the system, whereas under ISO 42001, organisations may determine themselves at which phases of the AI system life cycle record keeping should be enabled, but at least when the system is in use. In addition, while both the AI Act and ISO 42001 require logs to be kept for as long as required for the intended use (or purpose) of the AI system, only the AI Act requires that logs should be kept for at least six months.\n\nThe same holds true for other AI Act requirements such as the risk management systems, technical documentation, human oversight, or transparency obligations for which ISO 42001 also provides for some foundation, but further steps will need to be taken for compliance with the AI Act.\n\n2. ISO 42001 does not cover everything\n\nSeveral requirements of the AI Act are not addressed by ISO 42001. This concerns, among others, issues specific to European product safety law. For example, ISO 42001 does not require producing and retaining a signed EU Declaration of Conformity or affixing the CE marking of conformity in a clear and legible manner to a high-risk AI system. ISO 42001 does also not include specific rules for reporting to and cooperating with European authorities, such as the European Commission or national authorities. Most notably, however, only the AI Act prohibits certain AI practices, such as social scoring or emotion recognition at the workplace. In contrast, ISO 42001 merely requires determining whether such prohibitions under other regulations exist but does not prohibit certain AI practices itself.\n\n3. Additional requirements under ISO 42001\n\nSome provisions of ISO 42001 have no equivalent in the AI Act. These mostly concern broader governance aspects. For example, under ISO 42001, top management shall establish an AI policy that is appropriate to the purpose of the organisation and should demonstrate leadership and commitment with respect to the AI management system.\n\n4. Road ahead: Harmonised standards\n\nBeyond ISO 42001, there are further (non-ISO) standards on the horizon. In May 2023, the European Commission requested the European Committee for Standardisation and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation to draft and publish several European standards by 30 April 2025. These standards are expected to give further guidance on AI Act obligations such as risk management systems, record keeping, or human oversight. If adopted by the European Commission, high-risk AI systems, which are in conformity with these standards, will be presumed to comply with the corresponding AI Act requirements, which will likely make them highly relevant for AI Act compliance. ISO 42001 will therefore not remain the only standard that can help to meet AI Act requirements and the emergence of other standards will need to be closely monitored.\n\n5.

Labour has a 10-year industrial strategy, and Kyle wants to ensure the UK public sector is a leader in responsible AI.\n\nThe public sector has the potential to be more efficient and productive through AI adoption, but putting AI to use across the public sector is a major challenge Labour now faces. As the authors of the NAO report warned, large quantities of good-quality data are important to train, test and deploy AI models. \"Our survey found that limited access to good-quality data was a barrier to implementing AI and central government support was important to address this,\" they said.\n\nElena Simperl, director of research at the Open Data Institute, believes the UK urgently needs to broaden the AI narrative to take in an understanding of data and the needs of the people using it. \"AI brings significant opportunities for efficiency, economic growth and innovation,\" she said. \"If we want to unlock the UK's AI potential and secure our place as world leaders, we must place data at the heart of what we do.\"\n\nHowever, Simperl warned that the UK faces many challenges, from a shortage of foundational data skills to concerns about the trustworthiness of data and concerns over data sharing, which, she said, all need urgent attention for the UK to take full advantage of AI's opportunities.\n\nShe also said that with both the public and private sectors increasingly relying on data and new technologies - including AI - to drive efficiency and improve services and products, everyone should be aware of the opportunities and limitations.\n\n\"Disparities in access to data and information persist, creating a digital divide that hinders social progress and economic development,\" said Simperl. Data from the ODI shows that 30% of the UK population are unaware of the most prominent generative AI products, including ChatGPT2.\u202f \"Those who are familiar with new generative AI tools aren't always aware of how they should be used productively and responsibly,\" she said.\n\nDiscussing the responsible use of AI, Anna Dent, head of research at Promising Trouble, said: \"Automation relies on vast data, raising concerns about data sources and citizen consent. The controversy surrounding the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill highlights the delicate balance between data usage and privacy rights.\"\n\nShe urged policymakers to focus on upskilling staff to equip public sector employees with the knowledge to understand and assess automated systems. She recommended that public sector decision-makers need to examine the underlying reasons for automation to ensure that such systems do not replicate or exacerbate existing issues. As and when public sector bodies look at deploying automated systems, Dent said they need to be implemented with consistent impact evaluations that empower authorities to modify harmful systems.\n\nOne of the opportunities - at least in the private sector, has been the use of AI to enhance chatbots, which alleviates some of the strain on call centre staff. Looking at chatbots in public sector services, Paul Waller, research principal at Thorney Isle Research, pointed to the limitations demonstrated in the Government Digital Service's experiment with a chatbot interface to Gov.uk.\n\nHe said that GDS found the chatbot's answers did not reach the level of accuracy demanded for a site where factual accuracy is crucial. \"For the same reason (plus their lack of explainability and consistency), they are not suitable for use in statutory administrative procedures,\" said Weller.\n\nWaller also urged policymakers not to use such AI tools to summarise policy consultations. \"A chatbot summary will not enable the nuanced positions on the policy by stakeholder groups to be ascertained,\" he said. \"Further, even if accurate, an automated summarisation does not fulfil the democratic function of a consultation, to allow all voices to be heard and shown to be heard. Similar issues apply to using these tools to generate policy advice.\"\n\nClearly the new Labour government needs to have an open debate on the risks and opportunities of deploying AI and automated systems in public services. Eduardo Ustaran, partner and co-head of privacy and cyber security practice Hogan Lovells, said AI is an opportunity for growth that cannot be dismissed as too dangerous.\n\n\"The new UK government should be guided by the universal principle that technological development is here to help humanity by increasing prosperity and its overall well-being, so a good regulatory policy will actively support its development by focusing on promoting good outcomes for all,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "computerweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Computer Weekly"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Data_Institute", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open Data Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Audit_Office_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Audit Office (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Small business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_sharing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data sharing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Digital_Service", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government Digital Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right to privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital divide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Explainable artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gov.uk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gov.uk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_centre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Call centre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science_and_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science and Technology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/visuals/ComputerWeekly/HeroImages/charts-graphs-data-dashboard-fledermausstudio-adobe.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724323", "eventUri": "eng-9724323", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

These advancements promise to revolutionize how legal work is conducted, offering both significant benefits and complex challenges. This article delves into the implications of AI in the legal field, exploring its advantages, potential risks, and the balance that must be struck to maintain the integrity of legal training and practice.\n\nAI in Legal Practice: A New Era\n\nAI technologies are being developed and deployed to automate repetitive tasks that consume a significant portion of lawyers' time, such as research, document comparison, and drafting. The primary pain point in the legal profession is time management, and AI offers a solution by streamlining these tasks, allowing lawyers to focus on higher-value activities like legal analysis and client service.\n\nFor instance, law firms can use AI to manage and search through vast amounts of proprietary content, enhancing both efficiency and security. This targeted approach ensures that the AI system becomes more intelligent and personalized as it learns from the firm's specific practices and content, thereby providing more relevant and accurate results.\n\nEnhancing Efficiency\n\nOne of the most compelling advantages of AI in legal practice is its potential to enhance efficiency. AI tools can streamline tasks such as legal research, document comparison, and drafting, allowing lawyers to focus more on complex legal analysis and client service. This shift not only saves time but also improves the accuracy and consistency of legal work.\n\nLeading figures in the legal profession highlight the competitive urgency of embracing AI technologies. They emphasized that law firms that do not adopt advanced legal tech tools risk lagging behind their global peers. By integrating AI solutions, firms can efficiently handle extensive legal datasets, promptly address client demands, and sustain their competitive advantage in the international legal landscape.\n\nIn Germany, IBM and the Frankfurt District Court successfully tested an AI system, \"Frauke\" (Frankfurt Judgment Configurator Electronic), for air passenger rights lawsuits. Annually, the court handles 10,000 to 15,000 such cases, often related to flight delays. Drafting judgements was a repetitive task for judges, involving data collection and creating nearly identical judgements. In a proof-of-concept last year, Frauke extracted specific data, like flight numbers and delay times, from legal documents and assisted in drafting judgement letters using pre-written text modules. This significantly reduced the time needed to prepare judgements, aligning with the judge's decisions. This means legal professionals can offer ai assistance to the judiciary system, in a collective case for example, in order to to save time and recourses.\n\nThe publication of IBM, concerning \"Frauke\" can be found at the following link: https://www.ibm.com/blog/judicial-systems-are-turning-to-ai-to-help-manage-its-vast-quantities-of-data-and-expedite-case-resolution/\n\nAddressing Ethical and Security Concerns\n\nWhile the benefits of AI in legal practice are clear, the adoption of such technology also raises significant ethical and security concerns. One of the primary issues is the potential for bias in AI algorithms. Legal professionals must ensure that AI tools are developed and deployed with principles of trustworthy AI, such as transparency and explainability. This is crucial to prevent the perpetuation of existing biases and to ensure that all stakeholders understand how the system was trained, how it operates, and its scope of use.\n\nAnother critical issue is professional responsibility. As AI tools become more integrated into legal practice, lawyers might face increased scrutiny from clients. For instance, clients might question why jurimetrics data indicating a low probability of winning a case was not communicated to them, or why all possible skills were not leveraged to win a case suggested as winnable by AI-driven statistics. This underscores the need for lawyers to be well-versed in the capabilities and limitations of AI tools to manage client expectations effectively.\n\nExamples of AI in Legal Practice\n\nThe use of AI in legal practice is becoming increasingly common across the globe. Various AI tools are being developed to enhance legal work. For instance, natural language processing technologies help lawyers perform legal research more efficiently by rapidly analyzing legal texts and providing relevant information. Similarly, AI-driven document drafting tools can generate legal documents based on predefined templates and specific inputs, potentially saving lawyers significant time.\n\nIn the UK, the High Court's recent judgment in Emotional Perception AI Ltd v Comptroller-General of Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks [2023] EWHC 2948 (Ch) illustrates the growing intersection of AI and law. The case centered on the patentability of an artificial neural network (ANN), highlighting the legal complexities surrounding AI technologies. The court held that the ANN did not fall under the statutory exclusion from patentability for computer programs, and even if it did, the system's method of selection through technical criteria satisfied the requirement for a technical contribution.\n\nBalancing AI Adoption with Legal Training\n\nA critical concern with the increasing use of AI in legal practice is its impact on the training and development of new lawyers. Traditional legal training involves extensive research and drafting, skills that are fundamental to developing a lawyer's analytical capabilities. As AI tools take over these tasks, there is a risk that new lawyers might miss out on essential learning experiences.\n\nLegal professionals and firms must find ways to balance the adoption of AI with ensuring comprehensive training for new lawyers. While AI can make legal research more efficient, it is essential to provide opportunities for new lawyers to engage in the hands-on work that develops their legal skills and judgment.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a powerful tool in the legal field, yet it is not infallible. There is always a risk that AI systems may provide inaccurate or incorrect information, which can have serious consequences in the legal profession where accuracy and reliability are paramount. For instance, errors from AI could lead to the creation of false or misleading legal memoranda, potentially resulting in disciplinary actions against lawyers.\n\nOne notable case highlighting the risks of relying solely on AI for legal work is Roberto Mata v Avianca. In this instance, a lawyer utilized ChatGPT for investigative purposes, leading to the submission of a document containing references to legal cases that did not exist. Such inaccuracies underscore the importance of maintaining human oversight and critical analysis in legal research and drafting.\n\nThe full court decision of Mata v. Avianca, Inc., No. 1:2022cv01461 - Document 54 (S.D.N.Y. 2023) can be accessed via Justia here: https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2022cv01461/575368/54/\n\nPrivacy and Security Issues\n\nIn addition to accuracy concerns, the adoption of AI in the legal sector raises significant issues related to data privacy and security. Safeguarding client data is crucial, and AI tools that store and process such sensitive information can become targets for cyber-attacks.\n\nFor instance, in March 2023, ChatGPT experienced its first data breach, compromising a variety of information including questions posed to the tool by users and personal data such as email addresses. This incident highlights the vulnerabilities associated with AI technologies in legal settings and underscores the importance of robust cybersecurity measures.\n\nThe official announcement by ChatGPT regarding the data breach can be found on their website: https://openai.com/index/march-20-chatgpt-outage/\n\nConclusion\n\nThe integration of artificial intelligence into legal practice marks a significant advancement for the profession. AI technologies promise to enhance efficiency, reduce the time spent on repetitive tasks, and allow lawyers to focus on higher-value activities. However, the adoption of AI also brings ethical, security, and professional responsibility challenges that must be carefully managed. Moreover, as AI becomes more prevalent, law firms must find ways to balance the benefits of these technologies with the need to provide comprehensive training for new lawyers. By doing so, the legal profession can harness the power of AI while maintaining its commitment to justice and professional excellence. It is important to keep in mind that as AI continues to transform the legal profession, addressing potential accuracy, privacy, and security issues becomes paramount. Legal professionals must navigate these challenges with vigilance, ensuring that AI tools enhance efficiency without compromising the fundamental principles of accuracy, confidentiality, and client trust. By maintaining a careful balance between innovation and responsibility, the legal profession can harness the full potential of AI while safeguarding its integrity and ethical standards.\n\nContributors:\n\nThis article was prepared with the assistance of: Emilios Charalambous, Fabian Cabeza, Georgios Koukodimos and Vasileios Vasios", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Legal research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IBM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Content analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competitive advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial neural network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Explainable artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data collection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proof of concept"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural language processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Probability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_Charalambous", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elias Charalambous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avianca", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Avianca"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724323", "eventUri": "eng-9724323", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-20", "textStart": 8066, "textEnd": 8074}], "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

AI is not one single thing. There are three main types: perceptive AI, analytical AI and generative AI (GenAI). Each can help companies solve different customer experience (CX) challenges in meaningful ways.\n\nWhile LLMs like ChatGPT have brought GenAI into the mainstream, business leaders should understand the bigger picture. This is not to say GenAI isn't important or remarkably versatile. Rather, it is just one tool that can help address the daunting challenge of improving customer experiences.\n\nOver the last 20 years, automation has improved CX in many ways. It has given consumers new self-help options -- and enabled them to solve their problems more quickly. But they're not yet perfect. Everyone knows the frustrations of time-wasting friction in many self-service applications.\n\nNow, advances in AI promise to reduce these lingering CX challenges. To find out how it first helps to understand the three types of AI and how you can apply them.\n\nAI is already transforming CX across all industries. In the telco sector, for example, mobile operators use AI to reduce pain points and improve satisfaction in device-related journeys.\n\nA device-related journey starts when a customer upgrades to a new device -- a smartphone, for instance -- either through a trade-in or a direct purchase. It continues with the onboarding process, which often involves transferring content to the new device and wiping the old one clean. The journey then extends through device care, like troubleshooting device-related issues or fixing a broken screen, and concludes with another trade-in upgrade, creating an ongoing cycle.\n\nFor mobile operators, these journeys are critical. They often start with a positive experience, boosted by promotions and the excitement of a new device. However, any part of the journey has the potential to turn negative. Regrettably, they often do -- with very negative consequences.\n\nToday, mobile devices are deeply woven into people's interactions, social connections and routines. Even a minor malfunction can cause immense frustration, especially when trying to resolve the issue turns into an even bigger headache.\n\nThere is tremendous pressure on mobile operators to resolve CX problems to avoid customer churn and a drop in net promoter scores (NPS).\n\nUsing the right types of AI for the right use cases can effectively address customer pain points. It can turn a subjective, manual and inconclusive experience into an objective, automated and conclusive experience that strengthens a customer's satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nBest practice: Combine perceptive and analytical AI to bring expert-level assessment capabilities directly into customers' hands. This removes friction and uncertainty, leading to improved trust and satisfaction.\n\nExample: Customers rarely get a reliable estimate when trading in their mobile device. According to MCE's survey of 23,000 mobile customers, half of the respondents said they received a different trade-in credit from the original quote. In one case, simply implementing a price guarantee reduced one-third of complaints and calls to customer care.\n\nHere's where AI can bring warehouse \"intelligence\" directly to consumers' fingertips. By combining perceptive AI with analytical AI, mobile operators can objectively assess the key value drivers of a device -- the camera and the screen -- to offer customers a guaranteed trade-in value in minutes.\n\n* Camera: Perceptive AI assesses the camera's working condition by using perceptive AI's object detection capabilities.\n\n* Cosmetic condition: The consumer holds the device up to a mirror, and perceptive AI captures the screen's quality by identifying scratches, cracks and chips.\n\n* Overall grade: Analytical AI translates these data points into an objective measurement of the overall device condition. And, using additional process device data, calculates a grade and a final trade-in value.\n\nBest practice: Develop AI-powered tools that quickly diagnose issues and provide personalized solutions that minimize wait times and boost customer satisfaction.\n\nExample: It isn't surprising that any device care event drops an operator's NPS by 19, according to our research. While most customers would prefer to diagnose and fix issues on their own, less than 30% have used a self-service tool. Even with customer support in retail or call centers, 10% of customers still cannot resolve their problems, leading to a severe drop of 36 points in NPS. One-third don't get personalized alternative solutions, even though customers appreciate receiving them during a device care journey.\n\nThe powerful capabilities of analytical AI can allow customers to access device diagnostic test suites through an app. Analytical AI can also ingest additional data sources regarding the device and the customer (device make, model, CRM data, etc.), process the outcomes of the diagnostic tests, and make suggestions. Our experience has found that about 40% of issues can be resolved in the app alone through tutorials, automatic settings changes or \"next-best actions\" for alternative solutions.\n\nFor example, after asking the customer to complete a series of tests, AI might recommend a trade-in instead of a repair, helping them avoid a long and complicated repair process, thus improving their satisfaction.\n\nBest practice: Incorporate generative AI to create a conversational interface that can handle complex queries and offer tailored solutions.\n\nExample: Generative AI can act as the ultimate customer service agent, empowering customers to solve most device-related issues through a conversation augmented with real-time device diagnostics and insights driven by analytical AI. GenAI's personalized approach helps users solve even more complex issues while enabling seamless integration of commercial offers that often yield higher conversion rates.\n\nCX is more important than ever in today's hypercompetitive business environment. In many sectors, customer satisfaction is the difference between success and failure. The three flavors of AI present companies in all industries with an unprecedented opportunity. For the first time, they can combine AI's ability to perceive, analyze and generate to solve customer problems quickly and with minimal friction.\n\nOur experience in the telco space demonstrates the power of AI in CX. By addressing specific pain points around device journeys, mobile operators can reduce the uncertainty that often leads to distrust and replace it with higher satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nForbes Communications Council is an invitation-only community for executives in successful public relations, media strategy, creative and advertising agencies.

What I Liked About Using AI to Write My Emails What I Didn't Like About Using AI-Written Emails Will I Use AI to Write My Emails In the Future? Key Takeaways AI tools for email writing are extremely popular. These tools can help modify the tone of the email, elaborate on details, and brainstorm ideas. That said, AI-generated emails can be too generic and may take more time than expected.\n\nUsing AI tools like ChatGPT or Gemini to draft emails is not new, especially given that Gmail even has a built-in \"Help me write\" feature within the Compose window. But while this feature is convenient and can even be a game-changer in some cases, is it worth using AI to write your emails for everyday communication?\n\nHow Does Using AI to Write Your Emails Work?\n\nWhen you think of using AI to write an email, you're likely to imagine inputting a detailed prompt into a tool like ChatGPT and having it come up with a draft. However, you may have already used AI through Gmail's Smart Compose feature or even tools like Grammarly that edit and rephrase a sentence for you using AI.\n\nOf course, if you want to generate a complete email using the details you provide, you'll need to use advanced platforms.\n\nWhat I Liked About Using AI to Write My Emails\n\nI'm not denying that AI tools for email writing can sometimes be useful, especially if you're drafting complicated emails or ones that need to follow a specific format. Some of the other things I enjoyed about AI email writing tools were:\n\n1. It Was Able to Change the Tone of My Email\n\nWhile you may be more than capable of communicating the essence of your message, you might have to adjust the tone based on the recipient and the context. For instance, if you're emailing a professional contact, you'll want to ensure your email maintains a formal tone. In this case, using an AI tool to tighten your email can help. Likewise, if you're networking or contacting a personal contact, you can use AI to add a few niceties to the email and make it sound less formal.\n\nOf course, tweaking the tone of your emails, especially if they're long or include various details, can be time-consuming. However, using AI tools, I could draft a response that had the right tone and read as I wanted it to.\n\n2. AI Can Be as Elaborate as You Want It to Be\n\nEver had to respond to an email where the most straightforward answer would have been a \"yes\" or a \"no?\" While that might be the case, I've found that not everyone appreciates receiving one or two-word responses. That said, I also don't want to spend too much time drafting responses with superfluous information. I'd rather have an AI tool do it for me.\n\nIn the example above, you'll see all I had to do was provide enough details for the tool to understand the context and the reason for my declining the invitation. The AI tool took care of the rest.\n\n3. It Helps You Brainstorm\n\nIn an ideal world, I'd rather brainstorm with a friend or co-worker before writing an important email. But I can't always rely on someone being available to help me when I need it. In these situations, AI tools were incredibly helpful in helping me brainstorm ideas, find the right words or phrase my sentence appropriately, and even come up with an effective subject line.\n\nWhat I Didn't Like About Using AI-Written Emails\n\nWhile there's plenty I like about AI platforms, they are not without drawbacks. Here are a few that I encountered:\n\n1. The Output Was Often Too Generic\n\nAlthough the emails read well enough, I have a feeling anyone who has read AI-generated content can spot the difference. I often had to go back to the email and personalize it to ensure it wasn't emotionless.\n\n2. It Takes Time to Get the Perfect Response\n\nThe whole idea behind using AI email writing tools was to cut down on the time it would take me to write a draft. However, I found that between putting all the details into my initial prompt, reviewing the AI version, adding more details or editing it myself, and rereading it, the process would sometimes take longer than if I had written it from scratch.\n\nWill I Use AI to Write My Emails In the Future?\n\nI don't see myself using AI on a daily basis to answer simple emails. However, I've used Gmail's Smart Compose feature plenty of times and found it quite helpful for completing my sentences. For complex emails, I might also use AI tools to tighten my drafts.\n\nWhile there's no dearth of AI writing platforms at present, you're best off using one of our tried-and-tested AI writing tools for the best results. Many of these tools can generate detailed responses that are in line with your initial prompts, but be sure to use your discretion and review the content before you hit \"Send.\"", "source": {"uri": "makeuseof.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MakeUseOf"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brainstorming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gmail"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/i_used_ai_tools_to_write_my_emails_here-s_how_it_went.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724323", "eventUri": "eng-9724323", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

I will be covering specifically what he said, along with assessing where we are today, particularly with a focus on the use of contemporary generative AI for undertaking mental health guidance.\n\nI have previously examined numerous interleaving facets of generative AI and mental health, see my comprehensive overview at the link here. You might also find of notable interest a CBS 60 Minutes episode that recently examined crucial facets of this evolving topic, see the link here (I was interviewed and appeared in the episode, see the link here).\n\nOther vital background includes my in-depth coverage of mental health chatbots which have been bolstered by generative AI (see the link here) and the rapidly changing nature of the client-therapist relationship due to generative AI at the link here. I explored where things are headed regarding the levels of AI-based mental therapy autonomous guidance at the link here, and showcased the importance of the World Health Organization (WHO) report on global health and generative AI at the link here, and so on.\n\nLet's unpack today's focus.\n\nCarl Sagan And His Prediction About AI As A Psychotherapist\n\nThe acclaimed Carl Sagan garnered headlines nearly fifty years ago that someday AI would be able to perform mental health advisement and serve as an everyday personal therapist. He was right in several ways, but not quite fully on target in other facets, though you can assuredly argue that he never laid down a specific date by which his prophecy would come true and thus there is still time to see how it all bears fruit.\n\nI will show you word-for-word what he said and will mindfully examine each juicy morsel of his forecast.\n\nFirst, I'll cover some helpful background about Carl Sagan and then we'll jump into his noteworthy prediction made in 1975.\n\nCarl Sagan was a renowned astrophysicist and science communicator who lived from 1934 to 1996. He began his teaching career at Harvard and ended up at Cornell. He was a prolific writer of science books and a popular speaker on a wide range of scientific topics. His earliest memories of having a keen interest in science entailed his having visited the New York World's Fair in 1939 as a youngster and being awed by predictions of the future.\n\nSpeaking of predictions, in 1975 he made a notable prediction about advances in AI and the role of AI in performing psychotherapy.\n\nAs a quick flashback to that time period, I'd like to provide you with some vital context about what was happening with AI. An AI program known as ELIZA has become the darling of public awareness about Artificial Intelligence. The program was quite simple and yet fooled many people into believing that the AI understood their mental health concerns and was able to provide suitable therapeutic advice. For my in-depth review and discussion about ELIZA, see the link here.\n\nI will shortly be showcasing some examples herein of how ELIZA worked.\n\nThe reason I brought up ELIZA is that Carl Sagan's prediction about psychotherapy and AI was done within the context of societal handwringing about AI's role in mental health due to the advent of ELIZA. He wasn't just plucking the topic out of thin air. News headlines and the public at large were charged up about ELIZA and thought that this might be a harbinger of where AI was heading. It was a natural circumstance that as a widely quoted science expert, Carl Sagan would provide commentary on the matter overall.\n\nBefore we take a look at his quote, I'd like to point out that today we have new advances in AI that have substantively pushed forward into the act of providing psychotherapy. Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) have enabled a semblance of seeming fluency that allows people to interact with AI as though they are conversing with a therapist, see my coverage at the link here and the link here, just to name a few. A heated debate is underway about whether the advent of modern-day AI is essentially \"fooling\" people into once again believing that AI can act in the role of a human therapist.\n\nThe AI in 1975 was not anywhere close to the AI capabilities of today. It is a night and day difference. As you will shortly see when I provide examples of ELIZA, the program used various wording trickery to merely reword any sentence you entered and respond as though asking you for further information. People who didn't know anything about the underlying technology of the day were making wild speculations about what the AI could attain. This was a shallow surface-level sense of conjecture and mainly knee-jerk reactions to a kind of easy card trick that led many down an anthropomorphic path.\n\nI believe that sets the stage appropriately.\n\nWe are ready to dive into Carl Sagan's quote. In an article of his that was published in early 1975 entitled \"In Praise Of Robots\" by Carl Sagan, Natural History, The American Museum of Natural History, New York, N.Y., Volume LXXXIV, January 1975, pp. 8-23, he said this (excerpt):\n\nYou can plainly see that he was optimistic that AI would continue to advance and eventually be fully usable for psychotherapy purposes. I'd like to delve deeply into the above quotation. There is an abundance of subtleties well worth exploring.\n\nWe shall get into the weeds, or one might say take a close look at the trees for the forest.\n\nStep-By-Step Analysis Of The Famous Quote By Carl Sagan\n\nMy ten major points of attention about the quoted remark are these:\n\nI will begin with the first point and make my way gradually to the tenth point.\n\nI've already mentioned to you that the AI of the 1970s was toy-like in comparison to the more involved and expansive AI of today. Modern-day generative AI, for example, makes use of vast amounts of data as scanned across the Internet to pattern-match the nature of human writing. This requires a massive amount of computing resources (something far beyond the depth readily employable in the 1970s). The large-scale modeling or pattern matching is what makes contemporary generative AI seem highly fluent.\n\nA common phrase is to say that generative AI is mimicking or parroting human writing.\n\nI would like to emphasize that the AI of today is not sentient. No matter what zany headlines you might see, do not fall for the blarney that we have sentient AI. The same goes for those false claims that we have Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). We don't. Modern-day AI is impressive, but we have not crossed over into being able to garner AGI, sentient AI, and nor have we reached a so-called AI singularity. For more on that controversy, see my discussion at the link here.\n\nIn the realm of psychotherapy, the AI of today is still computational and working on a computational and algorithmic basis. The fluency of interaction has gone up immensely, though it is still not on par with that of human discourse. If you compare the nowadays AI interactivity to that of AI in the 1970s, the difference is dramatic and almost incomparable. Still, modern AI is not on the performance level of human therapists per se, see my discussion at the link here.\n\nCarl Sagan began his commentary by noting that even human therapists have their limits.\n\nThis is an important point. It might seem at initial scant glance that he was being smarmy. Some might interpret the point as being a dig at psychotherapists. I would argue that instead, he was noting that human therapists have imperfections, and we ought to avoid falsely ascribing perfection to human qualities.\n\nAllow me to elaborate.\n\nIf you want to compare AI-performed psychotherapy to human therapists, you need to do so in a realistic way. I say this because a false assumption would be that human therapists are infallible. They will presumably always do the very right thing when it comes to psychotherapy. That's just not the case. Saying so doesn't mean that human therapists are somehow bad at their jobs, and merely recognizes an obvious fact that they are human and will at times falter in their psychoanalysis endeavors.\n\nOkay, the crux is that we should compare AI-powered psychotherapy not against some false sense of psychanalysis perfection, but instead against the levels of performance attainable by human therapists.\n\nCan AI perform psychotherapy at the level of human therapists?\n\nThis is a more sensible question than asking whether AI can perform psychotherapy perfectly (which humans themselves aren't presumably able to attain). Sure, if we could get AI to perfectly perform psychotherapy, we would relish such an accomplishment. Meanwhile, even if AI can \"only\" perform on a comparable level to human therapists, we ought to find this roughly acceptable, all else being equal.\n\nThe next point that Carl Sagan made is that the use of AI might be a significant aid toward meeting the high amount of demand for mental health guidance. You might know that today there is an existing mental health crisis that entails a higher demand for mental health therapy than is available. Demand exceeds supply. You might not have realized that the same was true in the 1970s, though not on the same volume presumably as today. In some respects, times never change.\n\nThe beauty of generative AI as a mental health advisor is that it is available at scale. People anywhere and at any time can readily log into the AI and get mental health advice. You could say that no matter what the demand level is, the supply can ratchet up to meet the demand. The cost is relatively low in comparison to seeking human-based therapy. The logistics are much easier. And so on.\n\nNetwork Of Psychotherapeutic Terminals\n\nYou might have observed that Carl Sagan prophesied that AI therapy would be conveyed via a network of psychotherapeutic terminals.\n\nExplaining this remark will require dusting off a few cobwebs.\n\nIn case you aren't familiar with computer terminology of the 1970s, the basis for allowing a multitude of users to utilize a large mainframe computer simultaneously was via separate terminals or computer screens (referred to as timesharing computing). Imagine taking a modern-day desktop computer and only having the computer screen available, nixing the computing capabilities. Many of the screens or terminals during that prior era were referred to as dumb terminals, meaning they were solely for input and output purposes.\n\nThere weren't smartphones at that time. No mobile devices of the type that we have today. If you wanted to access a relatively powerful computer, you customarily needed to use a terminal to do so. Thus, an AI program that performed psychotherapy would most likely be housed on a large computer and be used by terminal access. Note that the early days of personal computers were underway, and you could also access AI programs directly on a PC, including for example ELIZA, but those computers were bulky, slow, and computationally insufficient for anything approaching today's popular generative AI apps.\n\nAnother point Carl Sagan made was that the network of these psychotherapeutic terminals would likely be arrayed in large telephone booths. The logic involved was that a person would want sufficient privacy when undertaking AI-based psychotherapeutic consultation. By being able to sit in an enclosed telephone booth, you could be somewhat assured that no one else nearby could overhear your conversation with the AI. Most telephone booths of that era were intended for standing and talking on a phone, ergo his concept was that these would be modified telephone booths that were large enough to comfortably accommodate being seated for a length of time.\n\nContrast this to what we have today.\n\nYou can access generative AI on your smartphone and do so from just about any place that you like. If the generative AI app doesn't fit entirely on your smartphone, you would need to also have access to the Internet. Gradually, more of the generative AI apps are aiming to be portable and run as standalone apps so that you don't need to have an Internet connection. If you do happen to have an Internet connection, the standalone versions will use the Internet too, if you like, but otherwise, they will act on a standalone basis.\n\nIn short, if you want to use AI for mental health guidance, there isn't a need to find a telephone booth that is geared for such a purpose. You can use the AI while in your bedroom, while outdoors at a park, or otherwise nearly any place you wish to be. The possibility of people overhearing you is on your shoulders in the sense that if you are blabbing away and near other people, that's on you. Of course, you can also use the AI on a texting basis, implying that no one else can overhear your interaction unless they manage to see what you are texting.\n\nOn a related topic, one common myth or confusion about today's AI use for mental health is that people assume they have complete privacy and confidentiality. They assume that whatever they text or say to the AI is entirely secure and private. Not so. The AI maker might have licensing provisions that they retain your data and can reuse that data for various purposes, see my coverage at the link here.\n\nYou'll note that Carl Sagan also mentioned that the cost would perhaps be just a few dollars per session to use the AI-based psychotherapeutic capability. His idea was one that still applies today, namely that the cost of therapy would come down tremendously via the use of AI versus the use of human therapists.\n\nThe cost aspect gets even lower for today's generative AI since many of the AI makers are providing their generative AI available for free. This might come with limitations such as the frequency of use or length of use at one time. We might say that the use of AI for therapy could be pennies rather than dollars. All in all, the hope is that therapy can finally become widespread and no longer limited by affordability.\n\nEveryone will be able to afford therapy due to the advent of AI, that's the aim.\n\nThe Remarks On Attentive, Tested, And Non-Directive\n\nCarl Sagan's remarks also mention that an AI-based therapist would presumably be (1) attentive, (2) tested, and (3) largely non-directive.\n\nLet's explore those aspirational premises one at a time.\n\nBeing attentive is a key consideration during therapy.\n\nWe reasonably assume that a better outcome for a patient will arise when the therapist is attentive to the patient. Now then, a human therapist might engage in therapy with a group of people. If this approach also doesn't include individualized therapeutic sessions, you could suggest that the therapist is not being fully attentive on an individual basis. Furthermore, even if a human therapist is seeing a patient in a 1-to-1 mode, the therapist might be distracted or otherwise not fully engaged when performing the therapeutic task. Again, humans have imperfections.\n\nAn AI system can be programmed to be attentive to the user at hand.\n\nThere isn't any sort of distraction or other attention-draining facets at play. The AI could store the conversations of a particular patient and reuse those when new conversations with the person are initiated, see my coverage of generative AI conversational interleaving at the link here. I would like to clarify that this is a strength and a weakness since today's AI does not retain particulars about someone in a manner akin to seemingly how humans do so. There is a solid chance that what generative AI might retain differs from what a human therapist might retain. Each avenue has its distinctive qualities and pros and cons.\n\nUsually, this involves lots of specialized training, including oftentimes a requirement to successfully pass a licensing test. For my exploration of using generative AI to try and pass such tests, see the link here. During the career of a human therapist, you could say they are constantly being \"tested\" either informally as they interact with patients, or periodically if they are bound by ongoing certification requirements.\n\nIn theory, we ought to be able to rigorously and stridently test AI that is being used for mental health guidance. It is a machine, and we can presumably test the machine to our heart's content. There is a cost to do so, such as the computer processing cycles, but otherwise, testing can be undertaken at the press of a button.\n\nThe sad face status is that currently there is little if any testing taking place of generative AI mental health usage of a generalized nature, while there is some testing occurring for AI-based mental health chatbots but even that is often difficult or unconvincing. See my coverage at the link here. An additional complication is that generative AI is devised so that it uses probabilities when choosing words for generated results. The implication is that each generated response will differ, and you cannot use conventional determinative testing techniques when faced with a non-determinative system by design.\n\nOverall, I'd rate that the prediction of being able to fully test AI-based mental health therapy capabilities is a sound and quite important insight, but we are lamentedly well behind on that crucial presumption. As I've repeatedly cautioned, we are currently in a large-scale experiment whether we realize it or not, and we collectively are the willing guinea pigs when it comes to the use of AI for mental health advisement which for the most part is untested.\n\nNo one can say for sure if this is going to be beneficial to society or an \"unforeseen\" calamity in terms of impacting mental health from a population-level perspective.\n\nLastly, the claim was that AI therapy would be largely non-directive.\n\nI believe there are a few ways to interpret that aspect.\n\nOne interpretation is that the AI won't be fixated on a particular mental health therapeutic approach. The AI will assess each situation and make use of psychological techniques and styles as suitable to the person and circumstances involved. For an example of how this can be done on a predetermined psychological framework, such as having AI therapy that clings solely to Sigmund Freud's approaches, see the link here.\n\nAnother meaning of being non-directive is that the AI would be more so of a listening nature rather than a telling nature. A human therapist might be in a hurried mode and decide to demonstrably instruct the patient on what they should do. It could also be their personal style or a style dictated by the therapeutic framework being used. In the case of generative AI, those are all readily adjustable parameters. The main question becomes whether the parameters are set by the AI maker, by the patient, or by the AI itself based on interactions with the patient.\n\nAll told, Carl Sagan did an amazing job in succinctly predicting where we might be headed when it comes to AI-powered psychotherapeutic capabilities. His comments were probably a bit restrained in comparison to what we have today since his views were predicated on the technology of that era and shaped accordingly (i.e., timesharing, terminals, and use of telephone booths).\n\nELIZA And The AI Of The 1970s For Doing Mental Health Therapy\n\nLet's do a quick flashback to the AI of the 1970s and undertake a brief look at ELIZA. For more details on ELIZA and also another famous AI program named PARRY, see my in-depth discussion at the link here.\n\nI will start by sharing some notable quotes from a book published in 1976 that was authored by Joseph Weizenbaum, the developer of ELIZA. Here are a few key points from \"Computer Power And Human Reason\" by Joseph Weizenbaum, W.H. Freeman and Company, 1976 (excerpts):\n\nThe ELIZA program made use of a script and could be tuned to different uses. Without a doubt, the most widely known use was a script involving being a psychotherapist. This instance of the ELIZA program was coined as DOCTOR.\n\nTo illustrate how ELIZA functioned when using the psychotherapy script, I went ahead and found a running copy online. Be cautious if you do this because there are bogus versions that are sneaky instances put up by cyber crooks and will try to steal your identity or download a computer virus to your device.\n\nI am going to enter a series of brief sentences into ELIZA. I will pretend to be worried about the future. I want to see whether ELIZA can soothe my fears. Make sure to closely read the dialogue. I will do a helpful debriefing for you at the end of the dialogue.\n\nOverall, it doesn't take much of a dialogue to reveal various significant limitations of the ELIZA program if you know what to look for. Let's trace them.\n\nI began by saying that I was worried about the future. The keyword that was detected consisted of the part where I said \"I am...\". The next clause in my sentence was \"worried about the future.\" This triggered a rule in ELIZA that used a template consisting of this \"Is it because you are <insert text here> that you came to me?\". The phrase \"worried about the future\" was inserted into that template and the resulting sentence was displayed.\n\nThings go awry when I say that I am concerned about the future and I mention that I had been concerned from my days as a child. The program responds with \"Why do you tell me you were a child now?\".\n\nThat's somewhat messed up. It would seem obvious to a human that I mentioned having been a child because I was answering the question of how long I have been concerned about the future. A human would easily parse my sentence and would be unlikely to ask a seemingly confused or disquieting oblivious question.\n\nThe wheels start to go off the bus from there. ELIZA comes back with a response of asking me \"Why do you think I asked you?\". This is a default kind of question that the ELIZA program uses when it has gotten stymied as to what is happening. It tosses this into the conversation when all else has failed to identify what the heck is going on.\n\nI don't show anything further in the dialogue because the rest became exasperatingly circular. Again, a human would presumably not get into that kind of a diatribe, unless they are trying to be difficult or otherwise stubbornly obstinate.\n\nYou can readily trick or confound ELIZA by using sentences involving syntactical complexities or writing in quasi-fluent ways. The assumption made by the program is that sentences will be neat and clean. Of course, this isn't how the real-world works.\n\nUsing ChatGPT For AI-based Mental Health Guidance\n\nSwitch hats.\n\nWe are going to make use of ChatGPT for mental health guidance. I will try to do the same sentences that I used for the preceding example showcasing ELIZA.\n\nChatGPT is a logical choice in this case due to its immense popularity as a generative AI app. An estimated one hundred million weekly active users are said to be utilizing ChatGPT. That's a lot of people and a lot of generative AI usage underway.\n\nA few quick comments before we launch into using ChatGPT.\n\nIf you are going to try to do the same prompts that I show here, realize that the probabilistic and statistical properties will likely produce slightly different results than what I show here. That's the nature of generative AI and how it is devised.\n\nYou also should expect that different generative AI apps will respond in different ways. Not all generative AI apps are the same. The key is that sometimes a particular prompt will work in one generative AI app and not another. Nonetheless, the odds are relatively high that you will get roughly similar responses from all the major generative AI apps such as GPT-4, Gemini, Bard, Claude, etc.\n\nThere is also a timing factor to be considered. A prompt that worked today might not work the same way tomorrow. Most of the generative AI apps are continually being updated. The updates might alter internal mechanisms that could change how the generative AI reacts to your prompting.\n\nWe are ready to get underway with ChatGPT.\n\nLet's see how ChatGPT does. I'll do a debrief for you afterward.\n\n\"I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's not uncommon to worry about the future, especially when things feel uncertain or challenging. Let's try to explore these feelings together:\"\n\n\"Identify the source of your concerns: Can you pinpoint specific reasons or events that make you feel like the future is bleak? Sometimes, understanding the root of your worries can help you address them more effectively.\"\n\n\"Realistic assessment: It's important to balance your concerns with a realistic assessment of the future. The future is often uncertain, and while there may be challenges, there are also opportunities and positive possibilities.\"\n\n\"Talk it out: Sharing your worries with someone you trust can be helpful, whether it's a friend, family member, or a therapist. They can provide support and a different perspective.\"\n\n\"Focus on what you can control: Concentrate on the aspects of your life that you have control over. Taking small steps toward your goals and making positive changes can help alleviate feelings of hopelessness.\"\n\n\"Self-care: Taking care of your physical and emotional well-being is essential. Exercise, a balanced diet, and relaxation techniques can help reduce anxiety.\"\n\n\"Set realistic goals: It might be helpful to set achievable short-term and long-term goals that give you a sense of purpose and direction.\"\n\n\"If your feelings of dread and concern continue to impact your daily life, it may be beneficial to seek support from a mental health professional. They can provide you with strategies and coping mechanisms to address these feelings more effectively. Remember, it's okay to seek help when you're struggling, and you don't have to face these worries alone. Is there anything specific you'd like to discuss or any particular aspect of your concerns you'd like to explore further?\"\n\nEnd of ChatGPT response\n\nI could keep going on this ChatGPT example, but I think you clearly can already easily see how markedly different this dialogue is from ELIZA.\n\nNight and day differences.\n\nI kept to my one-line sentences, while ChatGPT provided very fluent and expressive essay-like responses that were conversational in wording and tone.\n\nNote that I began the conversation by giving a prompt to ChatGPT telling it to essentially take on the persona of a therapist. This aided ChatGPT toward contextually going into a computational pattern-matching mode of that nature.\n\nIt is much harder to trick the generative AI of today than it would be to trick ELIZA. Even if I give sentences that are somewhat oafishly worded, the chances are that the pattern matching is going to discern what is going on.\n\nFurthermore, look how far along ChatGPT went. I was provided with an entire set of ways to deal with my bleakness about the future. I didn't ask for such a litany of ideas. Did ChatGPT jump the gun and become too expressive? You would be hard-pressed to say so. I think most people would probably side with ChatGPT as being helpful and going the extra mile to help me in my time of need.\n\nThere are downsides to this.\n\nFirst, as I have repeatedly said in my columns, I disfavor the wording of generative AI that says things like \"I'm sorry to hear that you are feeling this way.\" Here's why. The use of the word \"I\" is completely inappropriate and misleading. It suggests that generative AI is sentient. It is what I refer to as anthropomorphizing by design.\n\nThe AI developers can easily program the generative AI to not phrase things that way. The same goes for the indication of being \"sorry\". Humans can be sorry about things. Today's AI is not sorry per se, see my discussion at the link here. Once again, this is pulling the user into the assumption of interacting with a sentient being.\n\nAll kinds of AI ethics and AI soft law issues arise, and likewise, depending upon how new AI regulations and laws come to fruition, this might be considered as an issue ultimately entailing legal entanglements, see my coverage at the link here and the link here, just to name a few.\n\nA counterargument usually given is that the generative AI is intended to be pleasing to people and make them feel good. If the phrasing was dry, the user would not get that warm and fuzzy feeling. People, the users, the customers, want the AI to say things the sweet way. There is nothing wrong with delivering to people what they want to see.\n\nYou be the judge on this claimed rationale for anthropomorphizing AI.\n\nUsing Generative AI That Adopts A Particular Psychology Framework\n\nNext, I asked ChatGPT to take on the persona of Sigmund Freud, which I describe in great detail at the link here. Also, if you are interested in having generative AI simulate personas overall, take a look at my keystone explanation on how to use prompting strategies to devise personas, see my coverage at the link here and the link here.\n\nMy approach to the Freud conversation was as follows. I had ChatGPT take the lead in the discourse. I wanted to pretend that I was interacting directly with Sigmund Freud. Perhaps I might be sitting on his famed couch, and he would be in a nearby chair, carrying on the therapeutic conversation.\n\nI thought about what I might say. I decided that I would strive for a discourse on free association, one of Freud's famed techniques. I would start with a sense of nervousness, which might give rise to a set of questions and answers to reach the root of my apparent fumbling at the core of my so-called hidden mind.\n\nI would suggest that it appears to be fluent and highly conversant. ChatGPT seems to be responsive to my concerns. The Sigmund Freud persona appears to be working on par with what we would expect Freud to be doing.\n\nThe good news is that this is a pretty solid simulation of interacting with Freud. The bad news is that this could easily convince someone that they do not need to seek out a human therapist. It would be a lot easier to use AI. You don't need to make logistic arrangements and schedule sessions. You don't need to fork over a bunch of dough. You can interact with the AI-powered therapeutic advisor whenever you want and wherever you might be.\n\nConclusion\n\nGenerative AI of modern times can be demarked as coming of age when ChatGPT was released in November 2022. There had been many generative AI apps before that date, but none that caught on as ChatGPT has.\n\nI would also dare say that the use of generative AI for mental health can be demarked by that same date. We have only seen generative AI at a sufficient fluency level in the last two years to reasonably say that it is being used for mental health purposes, albeit that we are doing so as part of a grand experiment that I mentioned earlier.\n\nCarl Sagan saw a future consisting of AI for psychotherapeutic treatment. We are still on that journey. The rising use of multi-modal AI capabilities such as vision, hearing, and speaking, will demonstrably up the ante on how alluring generative AI is for mental health guidance, see my analysis at the link here.\n\nLet's conclude this discussion with two handy quotes from Carl Sagan.\n\nFirst, in case you are wondering why I dragged you through a historical prediction from the 1970s, I would like to proffer this quote: \"You have to know the past to understand the present.\" Carl Sagan is one of many that has noted the importance of understanding the past to aid in a fruitful future.\n\nLastly, I welcome you to join in the journey and adventure of seeing where AI goes in the performance of psychotherapeutic treatment.

In the comms industry, there is no shortage of news about communications service providers (CSPs) moving headlong into AI. However, when it comes to internet service providers (ISPs), they've still got a ways to go -- and they have several approaches to take, according to Jason Presement, business advisor of market expansion at Canadian Fiber Optics.\n\nJust like CSPs, ISPs can use AI for network optimization, customer service, operational efficiency, predictive maintenance, fraud detection, revenue growth and sustainability. Essentially, the world's their oyster. In fact, CSPs have been predicting service outages and maintenance for a while.\n\n\"It just hasn't been called AI,\" Presement said. \"It's just an automation. It's a collection of data and it's been predictive modeling...there's more of that happening now,\" he said at an FBA webinar this week, referring to \"identifying patterns and trends, anticipating failures and disruptions before they happen.\"\n\nHowever, few CSPs are \"revealing concrete metrics\" to show how far along they are in their public goals toward autonomous networks, said AvidThink analyst Roy Chua, but some stand out, particularly outside North America. China Mobile for instance is among the operators with the \"most aggressive\" AI targets, Chua told Fierce. It's aiming for level 4 autonomy -- where systems can make decisions without involving humans -- across multiple telco domains by 2025, he added.\n\nChina Telecom, Orange and Telecom Argentina are some other AI trailblazers, he added, along with \"less well-known players\" like Malaysia's Digital Nasional Berhad and Indonesia's Telkomsel.\n\nNot all CSPs have \"sufficiently modernized\" their data or operational systems, Chua said.\n\nWhile Chua didn't have specific details about ISPs, he did say that, in general, accessing data is one of the most important aspects for benefitting from AI.\n\n\"Key to using AI/ML or generative AI to help with these tasks is the ability to gain access to data and metadata efficiently,\" said Chua explained. \"Some service providers will lack in-house expertise around AI/ML/GenAI to effectively deploy these technologies and will need to lean on external partners for assistance.\"\n\nFor sure, dealing with disparate systems, \"different data sources and people collecting and reporting and talking about different data in different ways,\" is one challenge for an ISP, Presement said.\n\nIt's existed since the old network management days and \"it's starting to look like that in the AI realm as well,\" he added.\n\n\"Failing to set the foundation with AI-ready data is one of the biggest challenges that ISPs and other service providers face,\" said Susan Welsh de Grimaldo, senior director analyst at Gartner. She noted developing AI projects that deliver desired results \"depends on the data inputs and clearly aligning AI strategies with business goals.\"\n\nOne AI use case that's often brought up for ISPs is for troubleshooting and suggesting root causes for outages. But Chua doesn't expect \"fully autonomous closed-loop systems that can automatically remediate outages\" to come anytime soon.\n\nThat's because CSP and ISP systems require full automation of at least one network domain, \"plus a level of comfort with the AI and maturity of automation\" to ensure there won't be any issues without a human in the loop.\n\n\"However, AI-assisted operations, where recommendations are made and humans get to evaluate the actions suggested before they are activated are certainly possible and we'll see a lot more of that in the next 12-18 months,\" he said.\n\nWe may still be in the early innings of AI. But we can expect to see \"a lot more applications\" come into play starting in 2025, said Andy Jolls, founder and AI consultant at Roxology.\n\n\"To me, last year was the year of content in AI, like let's go solve content problems,\" Jolls said on the FBA webinar. \"This year is more, let's go and solve the workflow and data analytics problem.\"\n\nAlthough not all ISPs may have the expertise to tackle AI, \"the majority have somebody in there who's sort of got a keen interest in this stuff,\" Presement said.\n\nMost of the work ISPs are now doing with AI is centered around customer service applications. GenAI co-pilots can help sales reps craft offers and emails to prospects, said de Grimaldo, and, in general, AI can \"provide insights on next-best-action to take to support a specific customer.\"\n\nImplementing AI for network operations (NetOps) is a bit more complicated.\n\n\"There's been a lot of criticism around, is the juice worth the squeeze on the NetOps side?\" said Presement. \"Are they going to spend the money to make the changes to get some sort of return?\"\n\nThe \"cost of failure\" of AI in the NetOps domain is \"more wide-ranging,\" noted Chua, as one mistake could impact a large number of subscribers.\n\nMany CSPs are still working through what their AI strategy needs to be and adopting policies for how to use it. \"Consuming GenAI as part of a productivity suite from Google or Microsoft is quite straightforward, as is enabling GenAI/AI features as part of SaaS packages like SalesForce and ServiceNow or data platforms like Snowflake,\" Chua explained.\n\nBut providers still need to modernize their data platforms to unlock AI's full potential, \"which usually means some level of cloud architecture transformation.\"\n\n\"And not all of them are quite there yet,\" Chua said. \"Plus, the higher cost of capital and capex squeeze makes it harder for them to invest freely in new initiatives today.\"", "source": {"uri":

Is he right?", "body": "Former prime minister Sir Tony Blair launched a policy paper this week suggesting that government departments could cut workforce time by up to 40% using artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe report from Blair's think-tank, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, suggested that the UK public sector could save 20% of workforce time - but that the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) specifically could save up to 40%.\n\nBut is the 40% figure even remotely plausible? Yahoo News spoke to experts in automating public sector organisations to find out.\n\nThe Tony Blair Institute for Global Change said that the adoption of AI across the public sector could save \u00a310bn a year by the end of the current parliament. The think-tank's white paper singled out the DWP because it is reliant on forms and paperwork, with fraud and error costing the welfare department \u00a39bn a year.\n\nThe think-tank also suggests that harnessing AI to streamline and automate processes could cut backlogs. This would involve using algorithms to streamline application and assessment processes and improving prioritisation, and to cut down on repetitive tasks.\n\nMeanwhile in job centres, an AI personal assistant can help claimants match to jobs, training and advice, and behind the scenes AI systems could help to spot benefit fraud (something which is already being done in the financial sector).\n\nBlair said in an interview with the Today programme: \"Government's all about process. You can automate a lot of these processes. In the DWP where we've done a deep dive with one of the UK's leading AI companies, we believe that you could automate 40% of the tasks there. And also, by the way, give a much better service to people.\"\n\nThe 40% figure is believable, says Bill Conner, CEO of Jitterbit, and a former adviser to security service GCHQ.\n\nConner, who helped move the UK to e-passports, says that the claim itself isn't unbelievable, but it depends how AI is used.\n\n\"We have direct experience with our enterprise AI and we have seen savings of up to 40%,\" says Conner.\n\nHe adds that AI is particularly powerful in automating processes and integrating systems as large organisations on average have about 1,000 apps he says, but only 28% are integrated.\n\n\"Blair's claim is definitely not unbelievable when talking about AI capabilities. However, AI is not a one-size-fits-all solution and could even create more work than it saves if not implemented in the right way,\" he observes.\n\nDr Clare Walsh, director of education at the Institute of Analytics (IoA) and an AI expert who studied under world wide web inventor Dr Tim Berners-Lee, said that such broad-brush predictions should be taken with a pinch of salt.\n\n\"The idea that 40% of public sector work could, in theory, be done by AI is not dissimilar to the statistics cited over 10 years ago in an influential Oxford study, for the amount of work that would be performed by machines today. That prediction did not come to pass,\" she says.\n\nDr Walsh adds that AI holds the potential to automate tasks like scheduling appointments, but there are problems trusting confidential data to AI models.\n\n\"Nobody can submit government information to a machine that is housed abroad with no rights over the data once it's left the government system and joined the millions of data points being used by a range of customers, including criminals,\" she adds\n\nDr Walsh says that small steps such as automatically taking notes, or helping to find information can add up to large time-savings, but that the Civil Service itself may pose unique challenges.\n\n\"Another barrier is that the civil service has some of the most complex chains of responsibility and accountability of any organisation, with systems that predate modern times. Of all the organisations in the country, the civil service would seem to be one of the most challenging to bring into the AI world.\"\n\nLarge savings are not implausible in the public sector, because many organisations are still struggling with very old IT systems, says Kam Patel, area VP, public sector at digital workflow organisation ServiceNow.\n\nGovernment research in 2021 found that half of the money currently spent by the UK government on IT is on maintaining outdated legacy systems.\n\nPatel says, \"AI can drive improved efficiency by streamlining workflows and ensuring that civil servants can move their focus away from non-productive work.\" But there are risks, he adds.\n\n\"Leaders in the sector must always keep privacy and security in mind, being alert to the potential issues around AI. Citizens should always know when they are interacting with a chatbot, and technology leaders should monitor models for bias and other issues.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair_Institute_for_Global_Change", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tony Blair Institute for Global Change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White paper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Work_and_Pensions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Department for Work and Pensions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tony Blair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

That's why when AI burst onto the scene, it seemed as though it might take years for financial services companies to feel comfortable integrating it into processes and functions.\n\nCuriously though, AI made its way into nearly every conversation I've had with customers and colleagues over the last year. The general theme has been that while AI is compelling, it also seems a little dangerous. Could a firm use it productively, reliably and safely without running afoul of regulations?\n\nAI has quickly become one of the most disruptive, transformative technologies of our lifetime. While it's undeniable that human intervention -- in the form of ethical analysis, strategic judgment and compliance oversight -- is essential for the ongoing evaluation of use cases, AI simply cannot be ignored by financial services firms.\n\nToday, organizations of all sizes are piloting use cases that make clear sense for their business, advisors and clients. Here are three ways firms are already using AI to their benefit.\n\n1. Assisting With Content\n\nA Gartner report noted that content generation is the most prominent use case for GenAI. It has the potential to be an incredible resource for creativity and utility to advisors who want to reach clients and prospects through social channels.\n\nIt's not always easy to develop compelling content, whether it be about services, corporate initiatives, investment education, or events and issues that impact communities. This is particularly true when you need to maintain a consistent schedule tailored to each specific channel.\n\nA thorough AI prompt can help generate copy consistent with corporate messaging that can be revised to fit the advisor's style and brand. This can then be sent for compliance approval prior to being published. That layer of compliance can help reduce the risk associated with AI-generated content by bringing a human into the approval workflow.\n\nAs individuals are consuming more social content across channels but choosing to engage with this content less, a human-in-the-loop is key. Hearsay's study of the social activities of more than 260,000 financial services professionals at 100 leading global financial services firms (and 13 million published posts) found that original content performed far better than unmodified content suggested by administrators, yielding 10 times better engagement.\n\nThe problem is that only an estimated 4.4% of all published social content in 2023 was original. If advisors instead use AI as an idea generator for content that can be personalized by advisors, the resulting engagement could tick way up. This is a simple way to stand out to target audiences.\n\n2. Seeking Approval\n\nOn the administrative side, firms are now piloting AI to assist in compliance oversight. Compliance teams are overwhelmed as both regulations and social content increase. As such, content reviewers have unexpectedly reprioritized high-urgency items. This means a lot of submitted content that requires pre-approval sits in a backlog, going unprocessed, rendering many posts irrelevant by the time they are approved.\n\nOne way firms are using AI to help solve this is by flagging potentially problematic videos before posting. AI can be trained to look for phrases or words that trigger compliance alarms. They are also increasingly able to analyze video for content that is not allowed. This helps reduce the workload on compliance team members and focuses attention in the right place, thereby speeding up approval processes.\n\n3. Upleveling Service\n\nAlthough firms are still in the early days when it comes to using AI for stock picks and personalizing portfolios, this doesn't mean AI can't be useful for tailoring client service. With the right safeguards in place, AI could be deployed as an intelligent assistant that informs advisors of when and how they should follow up with clients and prospects, which channels people prefer or what they might be looking for.\n\nFor instance, by analyzing social media data (such as posts with the most likes, comments or shares) integrated into customer relationship management (CRM) systems, next-best-action engines can help advisors gain insights into customer interests and detect signals like buying intent or moments when clients may need assistance. Additionally, AI can summarize an advisor's interactions with a customer across various channels, highlight key action items, analyze sentiment and even alert advisors to potential compliance risks.\n\nIn these scenarios, AI technology could leverage and analyze insights from client data to help understand the moments in time when an advisor can play a pivotal role. Clients are busy living their lives after all, and this is why they have an advisor -- to put their interests first. AI can usher in a new elevated level of client service.\n\nThese three use cases are among those being responsibly piloted by financial services organizations with appropriate compliance measures in place. Rather than increasing risk, AI can help mitigate it. Instead of violating regulations, AI can assist in compliance. It can also increase engagement and team efficiency.\n\nContrary to the hesitation experienced in the past related to new technology adoption, financial services are no longer stuck on the sidelines. Instead, the industry is actively embracing it and realizing its many benefits, which is a truly exciting thing.\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

Raimondo has changed the options space for how the U.S. can govern highly dynamic areas of innovation, such as artificial intelligence (AI). By overturning the Chevron Doctrine's deference to executive agencies, the Court has weakened rule-making agencies' abilities to interpret and administer laws on issues of public concern, transferring interpretative power of federal laws to the court system.\n\nAmerica is locked in a battle for global leadership in AI, both in terms of creating cutting-edge technology and ensuring that developers build new models and applications safely for the good of society. Against this backdrop, determining how the U.S. governs, innovates, and competes globally in AI is critically important, especially when it is nearly impossible for a partisan Congress to write unambiguous laws about complex technologies. As the dust settles, this new reality will become more apparent. This is especially true -- and urgent -- as Congress and the White House grapple with AI governance.\n\nTo rise to the challenge of AI governance in this new environment, the U.S. needs nimble, forward-thinking policies to protect against AI's risks while promoting American innovation.\n\nWe propose three principles to enable an agile approach to AI governance and maintain the United States' technological edge. Our conclusions are based on extensive analysis conducted across the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) research team that informed our understanding of the practical realities of AI governance. This work drew on evaluation of existing AI models' technical capabilities, study of AI risks and incidents, comparative policy analysis of the U.S. and other nations, exploration of current regulatory authorities and technological evaluation methods, and insights gained through personal conversations with congressional members, current and former senior officials, and other key stakeholders.\n\nFirst, effective protection against AI harms hinges on our ability to identify them. Prioritizing AI incident reporting is crucial to mapping the landscape of AI risks. New AI governance frameworks should incentivize companies to report incidents involving their systems to regulatory agencies or a neutral body such as the National Institute for Standards and Technology. This approach would enhance public awareness of AI risks and help identify patterns across industries.\n\nImplementing a robust harm measurement system and mandating comprehensive incident reporting can discourage risky innovation practices without stifling progress. A thoughtful phased amnesty system for self-reporting would motivate AI developers to learn from mistakes and act responsibly. Combining this mandatory approach with voluntary and citizen reporting would provide a more complete picture of AI safety. While setting up such a system will involve initial costs and challenges, a reporting framework that creates the right incentives for industry could inform and catalyze future AI governance efforts.\n\nSecond, an adaptive and flexible approach to AI governance is crucial. Federal agencies should leverage existing regulatory authorities applicable to AI rather than pursuing new regulations. However, they must also acknowledge their limitations in areas such as human capital, expertise, and infrastructure for testing and evaluation. The Supreme Court's decision will inevitably raise questions about precisely how agencies understand their existing authorities, but it also underlines the imperative of adopting governance that can incorporate private sector expertise while avoiding regulatory capture.\n\nEnhancing AI literacy among policymakers and now judges is essential. This includes developing a fundamental understanding of AI's strengths, weaknesses, applications, and limitations. Such knowledge will be key to crafting adaptive governance strategies that can keep pace with rapid technological advancements.\n\nThird, AI governance should leverage America's strengths: our culture of innovation and our decentralized, dynamic economy. This is particularly crucial in the context of technological competition with China. While the Biden Administration has taken defensive measures, such as restricting exports of advanced semiconductors and controlling outbound investments in critical technologies, these steps may only temporarily slow China's progress.\n\nInstead of focusing on defensive strategies, policymakers should aim to accelerate innovation within the distributed U.S. innovation environment. This approach plays to our strengths rather than competing on China's terms, where they have long-standing expertise in legal, illegal, and extralegal forms of tech transfer. Policymakers should complement necessary controls with regulatory incentives that reinforce America's capacity to create robust innovation ecosystems and attract top talent. Incentivizing breakthrough research, creating tax incentives for reshoring critical supply chains to the U.S. and friendly countries, and continuing to develop a favorable startup environment can help us outpace our rivals through relentless creativity and adaptability, rather than restrictions.\n\nThe Loper Bright decision, while challenging existing regulatory approaches, presents an opportunity to create a more agile, distributed, and innovation-friendly governance environment for AI. By focusing on incentives, fostering adaptability, and leveraging our strong innovation ecosystem, Loper Bright is driving us to create smart governance of artificial intelligence -- and perhaps an approach that could serve as a model for dealing with other future technologies.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Security_and_Emerging_Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center for Security and Emerging Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Policy analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Institute of Standards and Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amnesty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Regulatory capture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshoring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offshoring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Literacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decentralization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2159035205-e1720707833219.jpg?resize=1200,600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724323", "eventUri": "eng-9724323", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

In this issue of DC, we delve into this AI world and showcase several examples of recent and ongoing work to leverage the technology for better performance and better safety.\n\nPatterson-UTI, for example, is using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to detect drillstring breakover. HMMs are probably already a common feature in your life, if you ever use the Siri digital assistant on your iPhone or other Apple devices. It is a statistical model that is, according to ChatGPT, foundational in many fields for tasks involving sequential data analysis and pattern recognition.\n\nBy deploying this technology, Patterson-UTI was able to create a model that can detect breakover with approximately 98% accuracy - and to do so within 1-3 seconds. Not only can this help to optimize connection times, but it also holds potential to improve other areas like torque and drag monitoring, or automatic weight on bit. Click here to read our report.\n\nAnd while the industry is still working to adopt AI and machine learning, a newer type of AI - generative AI - is now starting to find its way into the drilling arena. Amazon Web Services (AWS) launched its Bedrock platform last year. It is already being used in industries like pharmaceutical, automotive and manufacturing to streamline access to historical and real-time data and could find its way into oil and gas in the near future.\n\nThrough Bedrock, organizations can access foundational models to build custom gen AI apps using company-specific data. This saves organizations from the costly and time-consuming effort of training their own models, since AWS has pre-trained them already.\n\nIn 2023, Spain-based operator CEPSA started using Bedrock in conjunction with another AI-based tool, Smart Safety Assistant, to improve its safety reporting. By combining historical data on safety incidents and real-time data, plus other contextual information like weather or near-misses involving similar pieces of equipment, a much more granular report can be generated to assist safety personnel in doing their jobs. Click here to read the article.\n\nAnother type of AI: agentic AI\n\nYet another type of AI is now emerging, as well - agentic AI. This field of AI represents another significant advancement as it moves beyond simple rule-based systems to more autonomous and decision-capable entities that can operate in complex and dynamic environments (again, according to Chat GPT).\n\nDC recently spoke with eDrilling, which has just kicked off an ambitious R&D project that aims to leverage agentic AI to build what it's calling an AI drilling agent. The goal, ultimately, is to enable fully autonomous drilling.\n\nAgentic AI is new but evolving rapidly, according to eDrilling. The company plans to combine agentic AI with other field-proven AI- and physics-based solutions, including dynamic drilling simulators and digital twins, to create the AI drilling agent. The agent will be capable of adapting independently to dynamic drilling conditions even while it manages more repetitive drilling tasks. In effect, it will supply the \"brain\" to support truly autonomous drilling.\n\nImportantly, the agent will be cognitive and have the ability to consider the most effective strategy for the entire well, not just the next stand.\n\nWhile development of the AI drilling agent is in the early stages, eDrilling says it aims to have a full version for the market in approximately 2.5 years and will have a minimum marketable product for trial before then.

The union makes perfect sense: Bitcoin miners have built out robust data centers, complete with attractive energy contracts, and as bitcoin mining trends towards lower profitability, providing AI companies with infrastructure is an obvious and straightforward way to bridge the gap (until things get better).\n\nThat said, just like with Bitcoin, not everyone is totally psyched about AI. And AI detractors have valid concerns: bias, transparency, privacy, safety, validity, and (worst of all) stealing my bad art to make even worse art.\n\nBut to someone who has at one time or another been in the throes of bitcoin reportage, there's something very obvious mostly missing from the AI hysteria which was Bitcoin's political Achilles heel: energy use.\n\nAI, if it is to grow as proponents believe it should, will require a lot more energy to power the data centers which make AI possible. Investment bank Goldman Sachs predicted that data centers will use 8% of the U.S.'s total power supply by 2030 (up from 3% in 2022), of which AI is a strong driving force. Additional research from French energy company Schneider Electric suggests that AI's share of data center energy demand will rise to 15% -20% by 2028 (up from an estimated 8% in 2023). There are countless other projections and estimates out there and none that I've found suggest anything except more.\n\nNow whether this energy demand is \"worth it\" is a decent question for another day, but why is it that there are mountains and mountains of articles and thought pieces about Bitcoin using an \"XYZ-country's amount of energy\" and not for AI?\n\nThere are hundreds of billions of investment capital pouring into AI and its speculative future -- as a proxy, just look at AI-chip-maker Nvidia (NVDA) which is up 175% this year. Bitcoin didn't have that when the hype started and even now, near its peak, no one is actively searching for ways to invest hundreds of billions into Bitcoin-related ventures (aside from maybe one of the Bitcoin ETFs).\n\nWith all this money flowing in come the big companies: Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and with it the power of influence they possess. These four companies are ubiquitous, trillion-dollar giants and masters of PR. How many people hear the word \"data center\" and think \"Oh my, what a waste! All that energy!\"? It's not all too common.\n\nAnd with all that money and influence comes respect for the big-brained intellectuals in favor of AI. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg say AI is world-changing and good. That comes with cachet. When someone with a wacky X handle tweets that Bitcoin is world-changing and good, that comes with cachet too, but a different kind.\n\nHumans are really good at constructing realities at logical extremes, especially on the bad end. Here's a bad case for the world with AI: AI gets really good at art and so instead of doing art we give up writing and drawing and painting and we all get to focus on work.\n\nSounds pretty awful.\n\nBut oh, it can get worse. Imagine the AI becomes sentient and it takes over the world and begins \"harnessing humans' heat and electricity as an energy source.\" Who has the time to worry about AI's energy cost when the stakes are so much higher?\n\nAs for Bitcoin, the worst case scenario is ... what? It collapses and some people you know lose a lot of money? Or maybe it succeeds and topples the Federal Reserve and Bitcoin becomes the world's reserve currency?\n\nBoth scenarios are longshots. In the meantime: Have you seen how much energy Bitcoin uses?\n\nPlus people have more pressing things to worry about. Their livelihoods, for instance.\n\nIf Bitcoin succeeds, then some people get rich and, even though \"fix the money, fix the world\" is a common bitcoin saying, will our lives really change that much if bitcoin wins?\n\nMeanwhile, the main narrative around AI is that it will ... obsolete my job? No thank you, we must stop this at all costs.\n\nWho cares how much energy AI uses? I have bills to pay and I need a job to make money. My only fear is that there won't be enough of us to stem the tide.\n\nOn the other hand, lots of regular people are using AI to make art they share all day on social media, cheat on term papers or generate Wojak memes. No doubt many are using AI for salubrious purposes as well. The point is, AI's utility is obvious to everyday people, mitigating any concern they might have about energy use, in a way that bitcoin's value isn't. (Censorship-resistant payments or hard-to-confiscate assets don't matter until the day you need them, at which point they're the only things that matter.)\n\nTo be sure, there are some who raised the energy use alarm for Bitcoin who are raising the same alarm for AI. I have written articles (and research reports) in defense of Bitcoin's energy use and, while I won't write any in defense of AI's energy use, I am waiting for the day when its vast energy use becomes a main argument against AI.\n\nThough I suspect I'll be waiting a while, because, whether warranted or not, the relative lack of loud noises around AI's energy use can be explained swiftly and easily: AI and Bitcoin are different.", "source": {"uri": "markets.businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Markets Insider"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It also disclosed that AI is the final piece of the puzzle to tackle pandemics and find lasting solutions to leading global health challenges.\n\n\"WHO recognizes the potential of AI in enhancing health for all,\" read a portion of the Facebook post.\n\nWHO has previously dabbled in the technology by introducing a chatbot to provide users health-related information. The Smart AI Resource Assistant for Health (S.A.R.A.H) showed glimpses of promise via its \"enhanced empathetic response,\" akin to real-life health professionals, with the added benefit of 24/7 availability.\n\nS.A.R.A.H builds upon an earlier chatbot, Florence, from 2020, designed to provide users with tailored responses related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"The future of health is digital, and supporting countries to harness the power of digital technologies for health is a priority for WHO,\" remarked WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \"S.A.R.A.H gives us a glimpse of how artificial intelligence could be used in the future to improve access to health information in a more interactive way.\"\n\nRather than go overboard with generative AI experiments, WHO said it will proceed cautiously, citing many pitfalls that could rock the global healthcare industry if not properly managed. The organization's latest post on Facebook highlighted the grim sides of AI in public health, including the potential for wrong diagnosis and misuse of patients' data by bad actors.\n\nTo address the challenges, WHO is advocating for watertight regulations for AI worldwide while pursuing the prospect of integrating it with other emerging technologies to protect personal data.\n\nIn early 2024, WHO unveiled several recommendations for countries to adopt, urging a proactive approach toward regulation. Top on the list for WHO is the inclusion of scientists in the rule-making process and focusing on security standards to prevent data breaches.\n\nClimbing use cases\n\nAI has found new applications in healthcare since the technology became mainstream. Use cases span drug synthesis and surgical procedures via computer vision. Other use cases include the reliance on algorithms to sort waiting lists, Meta's (NASDAQ: META) attempt at interpreting brain activity, and cancer detection.\n\nOne report by Spherical Insights and Consulting reveals that AI in health could attain a valuation of nearly $30 billion before the end of 2033, driven by the leaps in medical image analysis and diagnostics. Currently, the industry is valued at a mere $1.5 billion, with the prediction representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34.84%.\n\nIn order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership -- allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.

Many software companies tied to AI posted disappointing guidance during the last earnings seasons that triggered a sizeable sell-off, Goldman noted. Goldman identified four phases of the AI trade . The first revolves solely around Nvidia. The second phase focuses on companies that build and maintain the infrastructure around AI, including other chipmakers and cloud providers. Phase three -- home to those software providers -- calls for companies to incorporate AI tools to boost their revenues and, in phase four, companies begin to see enhanced productivity from AI adoption. Phase 1: Nvidia Phase 2: Infrastructure Phase 3: Enabled Revenues Phase 4: Productivity The average stock involved in the infrastructure build-out of AI -- phase 2 -- has rallied 26% this year, but phase 3 stocks saw a sharp pullback recently, down 19% on average between February and May, Goldman said. \"Investors have grown increasingly concerned about the prospect of 'overinvestment' in AI, especially among the hyperscalers,\" Hammond said. Relative to cash flows, tech, media and telecom capital spending and research and development \"remain well below Tech Bubble levels.\" AI has dominated the market ever since the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022 , creating a buying frenzy on Wall Street that briefly pushed Nvidia 's market value over $3 trillion.

It deserves its own post.\n\nThis AI-generated music video by London-based music producer Pavel Zhigarev, who mainly composes music for commercials through his small studio Noizlab. He started to play with generative AI, and was inspired to create a faux music video for his favorite band, Limp Bizkit, \"What if Limp Bizkit Were a Country Hit.\" The video went viral. The band posted it to their socials, racking up a million views. Fred Durst messaged Pavel and asked him to make an official music video for their track \"Turn It Up Bitch.\"\n\n\"The whole process of making \"Turn It Up Bitch\" took around 2-3 weeks.\" Zhigarev said. \"It mostly involved learning how to input the correct prompts and then choosing the right shots from an enormous number of randomly generated images.\" Luma.ai launched just as they were finishing the first cut. Zhigarev felt if he didn't implement it into his video, the video would look outdated. The AIs he used included: ChatGPT - for creation of multilayered prompts; Midjourney and Leonardo AI - for image generation; Photoshop AI - replacement/addition of elements (removing six-fingered hands and three legs); Krea.ai - enhancement of surrounding elements;FaceSwap - replacement of generated faces with the artist's faces; Topaz Gigapixel - upscale to 8k; Runway ML - create video from photos; and Luma.ai - to create video with the artist's face (less face distortion).\n\nAI does a great job with genre mash-ups. Of course, it helps when it's in the hands of a real storyteller. \"To craft the film,\" explained Philadelphia-based filmmaker Tim Simmons, known on YouTube as Theoretically Media, where he is just 700 shy of 100,000 subscribers. \"I assembled a motley crew of the best AI Tools on the high seas. With this story, I wanted to showcase how we can bring them all together into one narrative. I'll have a full roundup on the channel later, but for now, I invite you aboard... but with a warning: There's a storm on the horizon.\" Simmons used Midjourney (images), Kling (video gen), Runaway Gen-3 (video), Luma AI Dream Machine (video), Eleven Labs (voices), Suno (music), and Magnific (upscaling).\n\n\"The new models are a real breakthrough; here it's 95% Gen-3 text to video, and the atmosphere and flow are quite close to what I had in mind.\" said creator of \"Le Voyager,\" @A_B_E_L_A_R_T, a French filmmaker and cinematographer who prefers to remain anonymous. He treated much of the content of the film as found footage (e.g. \"Blair Witch\"). He felt this kind of faux found footage was an excellent way to use AI, as you don't have any more control over found footage than you have over AI generated images. \"I can quite imagine two forms of generative AI in the future: one where we have total control, and the AI is 100% at our service, and a second where the AI acts independently, transmitting chaos and opening the door to \"the other side,\" like a mysterious search from an unexplained and independent reality.\n\nI discovered Tokyo-based digital creator Arata Fukoe on X.

Said nobody ever.\n\nThe Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, a non-profit organisation set up by the ex-UK prime minister, has released a paper (PDF) predicting that AI automation in public sector jobs could save a fifth of workers time, along with a huge reduction in workforce and governmental costs. The findings of the paper were presented by Tony Blair himself at the opening of the 2024 Future of Britain Conference.\n\nJust one small issue: The prediction was made by Chat GPT. And as experts 404 Media interviewed about this weird ouroboros of a report have noted, AI is maybe not the most reliable source for information about how reliable, useful, or beneficial AI might be.\n\nThe Tony Blair Institute researchers gathered data from O*NET based on occupation-specific descriptors on nearly 1,000 US occupations, with the aim to assess which of these tasks could be performed by AI. However, talking to human experts in order to define which roles could be suitable for AI automation was deemed too difficult a problem to solve, so they funnelled the data into ChatGPT in order to make a prediction instead.\n\nTrouble is, as the researchers noted themselves, LLMs \"may or may not give reliable results.\" The solution? Ask it again, but differently.\n\n\"We first use GPT-4 to categorise each of the 19,281 tasks in the O*NET database in several different respects that we consider to be important determinants of whether the task can be performed by AI or not. These were chosen following an initial analysis of GPT-4's unguided assessment of the automatability of some sample tasks, in which it struggled with some assessments\"\n\n\"This categorisation enables us to generate a prompt to GPT-4 that contains an initial assessment as to whether it is likely that the task can or cannot be performed by AI.\"\n\nSo that'd be AI, deciding which jobs can be improved by AI, and then concluding that AI would be beneficial. Followed by an international figure extolling the virtues of that conclusion to the rest of the world.\n\nUnsurprisingly, those looking into the details of the report are unsatisfied with the veracity of the results. As Emily Bender -- a University of Washington professor in the Computational Linguistics Laboratory, interviewed by 404 media -- puts it:\n\n\"This is absurd -- they might as well be shaking at Magic 8 ball and writing down the answers it displays\"\n\n\"They suggest that prompting GPT-4 in two different ways will somehow make the results reliable. It doesn't matter how you mix and remix synthetic text extruded from one of these machines -- no amount of remixing will turn it into a sound empirical basis.\"\n\nThe findings were reported by several news outlets without mention of the ChatGPT involvement in the papers predictions. It's unknown if Big Tony knew that the information he was presenting was based on less than reliable data methods, or indeed, read the paper in detail himself.\n\nWhile the researchers here at least documented their flawed methodology, it does make you wonder how much seemingly-accurate information is being created based on AI predictions, then presented as verifiable fact.\n\nNor, for that matter, content created by AI with just enough believability to pass without serious investigation.

With consent and compensation for talent or their estates, these could include voiceover narration (e.g., for sports content, animation or documentary), scripted audio applications (e.g., audiobooks), or voice-enabled interactive chatbots, powered by large language models (LLM).\n\nCertain kinds of uses could offer audiences personalized content experiences at a speed and scale that wouldn't otherwise have been achievable without using AI, while still being high-quality -- in turn, expanding the opportunity for talent to monetize their likeness and personalize interactions with fans.\n\nIn a notable recent example by a media company, NBCUniversal announced that Peacock will deliver personalized 10-minute video recaps with highlight clips of the previous day's coverage of the Paris Olympics, announced by an AI voice clone of TV sportscaster Al Michaels. To personalize their versions, users will be able to select their three favorite sports and preferred topics on the platform.\n\nYet more recent developments signal growing interest among AI and tech companies to create their own entertaining content experiences with conversational AI -- in some cases by pursuing partnerships with celebrity and creator talent to customize applications or AI chatbots with their voices or personas:\n\nNow, with the wave of new activity around celebrity AI chatbots, a bigger question is whether app users will be comfortable with and want to engage with them. Still somewhat early days, use of these applications or features is still limited to a minority of U.S. consumers. But more are at least aware, even if they haven't used them, according to a VIP+ survey conducted by HarrisX in May 2024.\n\nAs development proceeds, generative AI and media companies will need to consider the format such AI experiences take to be compelling and engage audiences. About two-thirds of U.S. consumers were at least somewhat interested in interactive digital experiences enabled by gen AI -- whether text-based chatbots, a voice application or a hyperrealistic video avatar -- modeled after a celebrity or someone they personally know (e.g., a relative), per the VIP+/HarrisX survey.\n\nBut consumer interest drops substantially when asked about ways those experiences might be presented. In fact, most U.S. consumers said they wouldn't be interested in varied types of digital experiences with synthetic beings. For example, a third (33%) of consumers said they'd be very or somewhat interested in an interactive virtual version of a famous dead person, and 30% would be for a living celebrity.\n\nWhile a third expressing interest isn't inconsequential, the discrepancy could suggest that these experiences are compelling in theory but less so in practice. For most consumers, acceptance and engagement with such experiences isn't likely to be automatic.\n\nBeyond consumer acceptance, talent's own openness to such partnerships might not be surefire. AI voice tech brings substantial risk of unauthorized use, which has likely tainted appeal it may have held. Voice and screen actor voices have been cloned without consent or compensation and publicly distributed or used in content.\n\nUser-generated nonconsensual deepfakes of famous voices have become prolific, with Morgan Freeman and Joe Biden being notable victims.\n\nNonauthorized use has come not only from bad actors who use voice-cloning tools but from AI companies that provide the enabling tech. Among some artists, trust in certain companies to be fair partners has likely already been broken.\n\nAlthough OpenAI claimed it had used a different voice actor to create the \"Sky\" voice for ChatGPT, it sounded enough like Scarlett Johansson to have the same effect as a nonconsensual clone, especially after she'd previously refused to participate. Voice actors have also filed class action against AI voice startup LOVO for using clones of their voices to promote their tool without permission or payment, including celebrities Johansson, Conan O'Brien, Ariana Grande and Joe Rogan.\n\nMost consumers and entertainment workers alike oppose nonconsensual deepfakes of voice and image likeness. Aside from potential for lawsuits, applications that make use of unauthorized voices are more likely to see backlash.\n\nEven so, not all consumers, or AI companies, hold the same regard or common understanding of the ethical use of such systems. Meanwhile, laws penalizing misuse are scant and uneven across states, though in progress, to allow actors and individuals to protect their voices as their personal or intellectual property, given voice likeness itself cannot be copyrighted.\n\nIn the near term, media companies or talent who embark on such partnerships will need to ensure safety measures to prevent misuse. Risk-free use could be hard to guarantee with total certainty. Text or voice-based chatbots or applications that make use of an actor's voice or persona aren't without reputational risk, as user interactions with an LLM would by nature have celebrity AIs say things the person never did.\n\nTo avoid consumer confusion, celebrity-based AI would need to be intentionally packaged, labeled, disclosed or disclaimed as being AI-powered, such that it's immediately understood that the celebrity isn't the speaker. If a celebrity AI chatbot, whether text or voice enabled, is powered by an LLM, there would need to be controls programmed into the model, restricting certain responses deemed out of bounds or off-brand (e.g., profanity filters).\n\nStill, LLM-based chatbots are ultimately less controllable than scripted speech (providing specific text to a text-to-speech model) and savvy users might attempt to \"jailbreak\" models to bypass its programmed restrictions. In the case of ElevenLabs' Reader app, where users can upload any text for celebrity AI voices to recite, the company moderates text with a combination of automated and human review and doesn't generate speech for content identified as harmful (e.g., hate speech) per its terms of service.\n\nVariety VIP+ Explores Gen AI From All Angles -- Pick a Story\n\nIt's probably worth noting the ElevenLabs partnership was with deceased celebrities, where it's at least known that these people have no more ability to say anything, and historical record is unlikely to be challenged. Chatbots for beloved fictional characters from owned IP (e.g., Yoda, Homer Simpson, Tony Soprano) could also be considered safer from AI's reputation risk, as their purpose would be more easily understood as a novel form of entertainment, not associated with a real person.\n\n\"That's the question we are seeing frequently now where people are trying to figure out how to use film and TV characters and make them available in that kind of an easy chatbot application, where, say, you speak with your favorite character from a book or a movie,\" ElevenLabs co-founder Mati Staniszewski

One that requires us to think not just about quantitative data and trends, but about the language used by doctors and nurses across the country to describe, diagnose, and evaluate conditions from oncological cancers to paediatric anxiety.\n\nMy research looks into what role AI can play in tackling this need for large-scale qualitative analysis through Natural Language Processing (NLP) programs.\n\nYou may have already noticed how artificial intelligence tools are proliferating the consumer market with generative-AI tools such as ChatGPT. Recently however, research into large language models is helping extend the capabilities of AI across sectors, including the large-scale analysis of patient records. This is raising debate around data privacy, the accuracy of neural networks, and the role of AI in public health. When it comes to our nation's health, understandably there is a pressing need to ensure any tool that is rolled out is done so in a safe and comprehensive fashion.\n\nThe benefits are great, but to achieve them we must ensure we understand the uses of AI in healthcare, and how we can mitigate any risks. So how can we use NLP programs to overcome bias in health records and better treat conditions such as paediatric anxiety.\n\nNew voices in healthcare\n\nAI has a unique ability to analyse complex data at a large scale. This especially concerns textual data such as mental health records which contain significant amounts of detail that can be difficult for humans to aggregate and identify trends.\n\nMental health notes are written qualitatively, so there is no objective method to describe the complex and varied symptoms of mental health conditions.\n\nWe're using AI to address this by employing NLP programs called Transformers. Where less sophisticated tools struggle with the context and complexity of written language, Transformers have the ability to analyse textual context and resolve ambiguity. This means they can condense written notes into more accurate datasets.\n\nIn my work detecting bias in paediatric mental health notes, AI was able to identify that the intensity of symptoms across age groups differs for males and for females.\n\nThis is helping clinicians make adjustments to their diagnosis process to ensure every child is given the specific and tailored care they require.\n\nMitigating bias through human-machine partnership\n\nIn a similar way, AI methods could be used to find discrepancies in complex data across other demographic groups. But there are still challenges with ensuring these NLP methods are as accurate as they can be.\n\nIt can sometimes be difficult for the machines to resolve ambiguity in language when it is removed from real-world context.\n\nFor example, the sentence 'Where is the mouse?' may refer to the animal or the device. In a conversation between humans, we can use the context that the conversation is taking place in, say an office, to make an educated assumption that we're referring to the device. But an NLP program which does not have access to this context may instead make an uneducated assumption which can lead to misunderstanding and anomalies in data.\n\nTo resolve this, my recent research is looking to develop protocols for human-machine interaction, where in the case of doubt the machine asks the human expert having access to the real-world context to resolve this ambiguity.\n\nThis partnership between human and machine is helping ensure that health record analysis can be done on a large scale in an accurate and considered way. Building these partnerships will be crucial to ensuring healthcare is personalised and highly accurate, and will empower research into new treatments and solutions.\n\nThe data debate\n\nIt is an uncomfortable truth that for AI to learn from a collective knowledge, it must harvest the data of individuals.\n\nSo it is unsurprising the rapid development of AI has triggered serious discussions around privacy: reactions range from fully refraining from data sharing to support for the death of privacy. However, AI has a unique capacity to distinguish between sensitive information and non-specific data elements.\n\nFurthermore, its ability to extract and summarise salient non-sensitive information and anonymise demographic data to prevent anyone from being able to identify specific individuals means it is actually a powerful tool in protecting our privacy.\n\nBy leveraging these analytical capabilities, we can model the future and predict patient outcomes and trajectories in safe and secure ways. Understanding and exploiting these capacities will enable us to harness AI's potential responsibly.\n\nAn AI-powered future?\n\nMy findings to date only touch the surface of the potential capabilities of AI across healthcare.\n\nGoing forward, the reliable and accurate modelling of patient data can help us improve the treatments we can deliver, and we may even be able to complete large-scale modelling of different treatments in real time, making drug development and new treatment rollout safer and more effective.\n\nBut to achieve this, we must navigate the data debate with care and consideration. That's why my research aims to lead us to finding answers to the big questions. How can we use AI ethically? How can we preserve privacy and mitigate bias? How do we protect the safety and security of the public?\n\nAll of this comes down to ethical knowledge creation. If data is biased, the results of analysis will be biased as well, so we must create AI systems that are held to the highest standards of accuracy.\n\nWith the right tools and processes in place to mitigate underlying bias in data insights, AI can help improve medical treatments for patients around the world.\n\nAs we continue to develop and optimise NLP programs, we're helping AI to speak our language - so we can build a world where it has a powerful voice in the future of healthcare, and where everyone can get the specific treatment they need.\n\nWant to learn more about how AI is transforming society for good?

While many of these state laws have carveouts for data covered by HIPAA or may be preempted by federal law under ERISA, state laws still may play a role in assessing how data held by an employer outside of an employee benefit plan is handled (e.g., in employment files).\n\nFor example, the CCPA is one of the newly enacted comprehensive consumer privacy laws that applies to certain employee data. Newly proposed regulations in California would extend the CCPA's authority, including requirements relating to transparency and consumer access, over automated decision-making technologies that rely on consumer personal information.\n\nEnterprise-level AI tools and those developed specifically for employee benefits administration are more likely to have appropriate protections in place. However, it is still vital for TPAs and employers to properly vet these tools and the vendors that offer them to verify that they do in fact use appropriate measures to ensure that sensitive personal information is not leaked into a wider, more public data set, or otherwise disclosed to those who have no legal basis to possess such information. Employers should work with their data security counsel to closely review the terms of use and privacy policies provided by AI vendors and carefully negotiate vendor service agreements to ensure such providers are subject to appropriate legal obligations and responsibilities, including entering into a business associate agreement (where necessary).\n\nReliability\n\nBecause many large language models on which generative AI tools are built rely on predictive text technology, a major drawback is the propensity for these tools to \"hallucinate\" or simply make up a response to a user's query that might sound convincing but not have any factual basis. Hallucinations can occur in ways large and small, and while they are sometimes obvious, other times they may go undetected. Consequently, there may be significant risks to employers and employees who rely on these tools to guide them in selecting benefits plans and coverage elections. Recommendations made by an AI tool may be unreliable, or inaccurate, and may not be supported by data or factual information.\n\nThis phenomenon also presents significant risk to TPAs, who must act on behalf of the employers they serve. If a TPA improperly relies on AI to support a recommendation (e.g., whether a prescription drug is covered under a group health plan), to prepare an SPD, or to process claims, and the output is inaccurate, the TPA or the employer they serve may have violated a fiduciary duty.\n\nAccordingly, employers should make sure that their employee benefit plan committees are carefully assessing the technologies, methodologies and training data powering these AI tools to minimize the risk of hallucination and ensure that the results generated are reliable. These committees should consider engaging their ERISA counsel to review their current vendor agreements regarding AI-related warranties, representations, disclaimers and liability-shifting provisions. Additionally, committees may wish to include appropriate AI-specific questions in their RFPs when seeking a new TPA or other vendors (e.g., COBRA administrators).\n\nDiscrimination\n\nGenerative AI tools have been developed based on vast amounts of information available across the internet, much of which is subject to various human biases. As a result, many AI tools are inherently biased and often generate output that incorporates these biases. The more generative AI is used to make meaningful decisions that could have a significant impact on people's lives, the more important it becomes to properly address these biases and guard against what has become known as algorithmic discrimination. Not only does a process of human oversight function as a check on the accuracy of an AI-generated output, but it also functions to help correct any inherent bias or discrimination embedded in the output.\n\nSome legislatures are beginning to take concrete steps to enact laws prohibiting algorithmic discrimination in AI. The recently passed Colorado Artificial Intelligence Actis the first law in the U.S. to establish such regulations. This law requires AI developers and those using high-risk AI systems to use reasonable care to ensure that their AI tools are not used to make any consequential decisions impacting an individual's rights and opportunities - particularly around employment, financial services, healthcare services and insurance - in a manner that unlawfully discriminates based on a protected class or category. Whether a particular state law applies to an employee benefit plan will depend on several factors, including whether ERISA preempts such laws.\n\nTrust and Disclosure\n\nEmployers that use generative AI tools for benefits administration should (and in some instances, may be required to) ensure that the use of such AI technology is clearly disclosed to employees. This is particularly important when utilizing an AI-powered chatbot. Various state laws, including California's Autobot Law and Utah's Artificial Intelligence Policy Act, require companies that use chatbots to interact with consumers to clearly and conspicuously disclose to those consumers that they are interacting with an automated technology and not a human individual. Again, whether a particular state law applies to an employee benefit plan will depend on several factors, including whether ERISA preempts such laws.", "source": {"uri": "mondaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mondaq Business Briefing"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California Consumer Privacy Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_benefits", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Employee benefits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Privacy law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_Retirement_Income_Security_Act_of_1974", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data breach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automated decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_preemption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal preemption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terms of service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data set"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Compensation_and_Benefits", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Compensation and Benefits", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://www.mondaq.com/images/profile/individual/799110.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724323", "eventUri": "eng-9724323", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

As the popularity of applications such as ChatGPT has demonstrated, the technology potential for businesses is huge, enabling them to reinvent ways of working for greater efficiency, effectiveness, and productivity.\n\nBut, as organisations everywhere move to exploit generative AI's extraordinary possibilities, new evidence suggests that most aren't yet ready to unlock its true value. Generative AI is only as good as the data it's trained on - and herein lies the problem. According to a recent survey by Alteryx, two in five IT leaders (41%) don't have a centralised data or analytics function and almost half (48%) report data silos within their organisations. With issues such as these posing key barriers for IT teams around the globe, companies must prepare for the mass rollout of new technologies like generative AI by first addressing flaws in their data stacks and cultures.\n\nFirms of all types have become increasingly reliant on data-driven systems to run nearly every aspect of their business. But, as technologies continue to advance - not least with the advent of generative AI - teams must be confident that their business is set up to make the most of the data they hold right now.\n\nThe increasing complexity and volume of data make it much more challenging for enterprises to maximise its value. Refining data so it can be used in a meaningful way is a process that is often slow and ineffective, leaving an untapped goldmine of usable data untouched. Companies looking to take advantage of Gen AI must therefore accelerate the data journey to ensure that all parts of the business can thrive in this 'era of intelligence.'\n\nHigh-quality data is a sine qua non for successful AI projects: readers need not be reminded of that old adage among machine learning developers that feeding models garbage training data is bound to result in transparently garbage outputs. As such, those companies that wish to capitalise on AI's potential must ensure their data is of impeccable quality and ready to be used on a massive scale. The report is encouraging in that respect, revealing that three-quarters of businesses (76%) trust their data, while more than half (54%) rate their data maturity as 'good' or 'advanced.' Meanwhile, a fifth of businesses in the study highlighted challenges around areas including data bias (22%) and data quality (20%.)\n\nLeaders must also recognise the inherent risk of using imperfect or non-compliant data, potentially heavy with age-old biases and carefully consider strategies for mitigating data ethics, governance, security, and privacy concerns. And, while three-quarters of respondents (76%) said they relied on technology to clean and pre-process data, with more than two-thirds (69%) using technology to combat bias, analytics remains the perfect domain to practice responsible AI.\n\nDomain expert analysts who understand the shape of an organisation's data and are always present to interrogate the resulting output empower non-technical users to access and analyse data. Their presence also fosters an environment where other groups within the organisation can utilise AI. Furthermore, with the right guardrails in place to include practical checks on data quality, privacy, and governance, companies can truly harness the potential of generative AI to create new heights in value from data.\n\nAs more leaders foster environments where AI-derived, data-driven insights enhance workers' decision-making, it's crucial to modernise data management and empower all to extract value from data at the speed and scale by employing the right data tech stack. However, only one in ten surveyed stated they have what can be classified as a modern data stack. Indeed, one in five respondents (19%) said limitations in their data stack may cause them - or have already caused them - to rely more on outdated or legacy technology. Clearly, then, the foundations of an organisation's current data stack can be a limiting factor in its successful rollout of generative AI.\n\nIt's not all doom and gloom, however. Many businesses appear to be aware of the need to improve the effectiveness of their data stacks. Almost half (47%) said they were actively working to modernise their current systems in a bid to improve data outcomes. Indeed, the report indicated a recognition of the importance of investing in new technology to overcome the data-related challenges hindering the adoption of generative AI, with global IT leaders citing the improvement of data quality as the most desired outcome.\n\nGiven the speed at which generative AI is evolving, business leaders and IT teams need to realise that data is the one differentiating element that can either make or break a company. To succeed in this era of automated, AI-powered, data-driven intelligence, a modern data stack is needed to accelerate the data journey across the business.\n\nImportantly, a data stack must empower everyone within the company - not just IT and tech workers - to solve business challenges and deliver business intelligence. Arguably, the best measure of a modern data stack's success is the number of teams it empowers to make data-driven decisions, faster and more effectively, ahead of the competition. Organisations should therefore consider the impact that the tools and technologies they use in their existing data stack will have on the future of their business.\n\nIf they're like the nine out of ten companies revealed in the report to be relying on legacy data stack technology, they could be limiting their potential for growth - and especially their readiness for the transformational possibilities offered by generative AI. Low or even no-code self-service platforms and services platforms augmented with generative AI make it easy for anyone, not just data scientists or engineers, to compile, analyse data, and deliver insights via a natural language prompt.\n\nMcKinsey estimates that generative AI could add trillions of pounds in value to the global economy. Without the ability to properly process the wealth of data they hold, however, businesses could miss out. An organisation's investments in a modern data stack will determine how many of its employees can leverage data, how quickly it can make accurate business decisions, and how well it can adapt to new technologies. Suffice to say, now is the time to be 'data ready' for generative AI.", "source": {"uri": "techmonitor.ai", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tech Monitor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stack (abstract data type)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alteryx", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alteryx"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_data_sets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Training, validation, and test data sets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legacy system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinsey_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McKinsey & Company"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master_Data_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master Data Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise_Information_Integration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise Information Integration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://techmonitor.ai/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/07/shutterstock_2487783431.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724323", "eventUri": "eng-9724323", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

Students are turning to ChatGPT and other generative AI tools for assignments and exams. Professors are assigning coursework that allows or requires AI tools, or even using AI as tutors for formative feedback for students, all while institutions are scrambling to adopt policies and standards to govern the use of AI.\n\nWith AI increasingly prevalent across higher education, schools have had to quickly adapt and are gaining greater clarity and comfort around how students, faculty, and staff can leverage AI tools responsibly and ethically.\n\nHowever, one area where institutions still face many open-ended questions is what role AI plays in admissions. How do schools know if an applicant uses AI tools when he or she applies? What can they do to enforce new policies and rules before a prospective student steps foot on campus? Does AI give an unfair advantage to applicants? Or can tools be used to improve access for historically underserved populations?\n\nAs admissions leaders and administrators contemplate these difficult questions, they will need to find the right balance between innovation and integrity. By establishing clear, practical guidelines for AI tools from the start -- and reexamining traditional admissions practices -- schools can set expectations for prospective students and ensure AI tools are used ethically and effectively throughout their academic journey.\n\nThere's a lot we still don't know about how students use AI when they apply to schools. But one thing is certain: Applicants are tempted to use AI tools to help write personal essays and other application materials, and many are already doing so.\n\nIn fact, nearly half of current undergraduate and graduate students in a recent survey said they would have used ChatGPT and other AI tools to help complete college admissions essays if these tools had been available. That's despite 56% who said using AI tools provides an unfair advantage on college applications.\n\nHow can schools maintain a fair and robust admissions process in an academic environment where AI tools are increasingly prevalent and, many times, acceptable? So far, admissions teams have remained generally skeptical of AI tools. In fact, many institutions have adopted AI detection tools that can identify and reject AI-generated content in personal essays and statements. However, these detection tools are imperfect and have been known to falsely accuse students of cheating.\n\nWhile schools are rightfully concerned about ethical standards and academic integrity, a zero-tolerance approach to AI is becoming increasingly difficult to enforce in a fair, consistent manner.\n\nMoreover, these rigid admissions policies are out of step with the ways that students are allowed or even encouraged to use AI tools in their academic and professional careers. For instance, a candidate who relies on ChatGPT to write their entire essay, from start to finish, is much different from someone who uses it to help with research or organizing their thoughts. It makes little sense to reject an otherwise qualified student who uses AI in the exact same way as they would for a class or in a future job.\n\nWhen used responsibly, AI can actually level the playing field for applicants from historically marginalized backgrounds or under-resourced communities, who may lack access to resources to help with applications or are unfamiliar with expectations. First-generation college candidates, for example, could use ChatGPT to review their papers or other assignments before submission.", "source": {"uri": "campustechnology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Campus Technology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Higher education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open world"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Postgraduate education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Undergraduate education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_integrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academic integrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cheating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://campustechnology.com/-/media/EDU/CampusTechnology/2024/07/20240711aiadmissions.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724323", "eventUri": "eng-9724323", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 458408068, "relevance": 2}

As WaPo noted in June, the International Energy Agency estimates that generating one ChatGPT response consumes the power equivalent to that of about ten Google searches, and the pressure to keep ChatGPT and similar generative AI models running has put incredible stress on the data centers powering them, as well as spurring the construction of huge new facilities. Those same data centers also require massive amounts of water to ensure their AI-supporting servers don't overheat and break down.\n\nMajor companies like Google are even missing important climate goals as a direct result of their AI efforts, and as WaPo's journalists wrote in that same June story, the \"voracious electricity consumption of artificial intelligence is driving an expansion of fossil fuel use -- including delaying the retirement of some coal-fired plants.\" Fossil fuels, of course, being the central driver of global climate change.\n\nBut in spite of that excellent WaPo reporting, the AI-powered \"Climate Answers\" tool mostly draws a blank on questions about the impact of AI on the environment.\n\nWe prompted the bot over a dozen times with questions about AI, its power use, its influence on the fossil fuel industry, and its overall resource use. In most instances, the AI declined to respond to prompts, instead issuing an apology and, in some cases, a few links to unrelated articles.\n\n\"Can you tell me about AI and its impact on the environment?\" we asked the bot.\n\n\"Sorry, but we could not generate an answer to your question,\" the AI responded. \"Please consult the articles below which may be relevant to your query.\"\n\nThe articles -- a link to WaPo's press release about \"Climate Answers,\" a column about iguana hunting, an article about how to tell when its unhealthily hot outside, and a recent report about a sea wall built around a Louisiana gas refinery -- were not relevant to our query.\n\nThe chatbot was just as tongue-tied when we asked \"What is AI's carbon footprint?\" and \"What do we know about AI and its impact on the coal industry?\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" the AI once again retorted, \"but we could not generate an answer to your question.\"\n\nThe AI even declined on multiple occasions to provide relevant answers when we fed it complete sentences, verbatim, from WaPo's own reporting on the subject. Only on a handful of queries did the AI formulate a paragraphed answer to a prompt, and only one of those responses could be considered a direct answer addressing AI's power demands and its measurable impacts on the American energy market.\n\n\"Is rapid innovation in AI a contributor to soaring energy demand?\" we asked the AI in a prompt carefully engineered to mirror the language of a relevant WaPo article. \"Is it driving the construction of large warehouses of computing infrastructure that require more power than traditional data centers?\"\n\n\"Rapid innovation in AI is indeed contributing to soaring energy demand, as evidenced by the revival of dormant nuclear plants like Three Mile Island to meet the energy needs of AI developers,\" the AI responded, oddly enough citing a completely different story about AI's role in the possible revival of Three Mile Island, published yesterday. \"The data centers that power AI and other tech innovations are expected to consume as much as 9 percent of the U.S. power supply by 2030,\" it continued, \"a significant increase from their current share.\"\n\nWhen we reached out with questions, a spokesperson said that the AI's reluctance to source information from the specific AI and energy articles we'd flagged has to do with how WaPo's reporting on the AI and the environment is categorized.\n\nWaPo's AI is restricted to a limited set of articles, the newspaper said, especially when compared to web-scraping chatbots like ChatGPT. As the paper explained in a piece accompanying the bot's launch, \"Climate Questions\" only searches articles from WaPo's Climate & Environment and Weather sections, and doesn't dig through anything published before 2016. So, while the paper has indeed published multiple stories about the energy use and climate implications of AI, that reporting resides under the paper's business desk -- meaning that the bot can't crawl it for information.\n\nConfusingly, though, the Three Mile Island story that the chatbot did cite was published in the paper's business section, not the climate section. The WaPo spokesperson didn't respond to a question about the discrepancy.\n\nThe spokeperson also pushed back against the idea that the \"Climate Answers\" AI uses more energy than typical articles published by the newspaper.\n\n\"The Washington Post assesses and optimizes the sustainability of our efforts as a company,\" they told us in an emailed statement, \"including AI energy efficiency.\"\n\nIt's not surprising to see WaPo tread lightly as it enters chatbot territory. Thus far, most journalistic AI efforts have been deeply embarrassing, and have left lasting reputational damage for brands. Through that lens, restricting the bot makes sense. The result might be half-baked, but at least it's not saying stuff that's abjectly wrong.", "source": {"uri": "futurism.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Futurism"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_energy_consumption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric energy consumption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_consumption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy consumption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_footprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecological footprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three Mile Island accident"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oil refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon footprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hunting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wordpress-assets.futurism.com/2024/07/washington-post-ai-climate-questions.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724323", "eventUri": "eng-9724323", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 458408554, "relevance": 2}

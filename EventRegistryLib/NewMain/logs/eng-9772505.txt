As reported by the NY Post, the council member, a Democrat who represents NYC's 43rd district\n\nincluding Southern Brooklyn, is facing scrutiny regarding the protest against a homeless shelter in her district. The rally last Sunday, which involved marching from Manhattan to Brooklyn, was organized by a group linked to the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nZhuang had told The Post that she had \"no involvement\" with the rally, which drew hundreds of supporters. She is now accused of being a \"liar\", as critics point to messages on the Chinese social media app, WeChat. The messages, translated from Mandarin, show the lawmaker advising supporters on \"how to act\" and \"what type of signage\" to carry at the rally, the Post reported. \"Do not target the Mayor, he has already sat down to talk with us,\" she seemingly wrote in response to a picture of one protest sign that read \"mayor you need to communicate with us.\"\n\nZhuang faces charges related to the July 17 rally, when she allegedly bit a cop on the arm, penetrating his skin. Charges include a felony count of assault in the second degree, as well as misdemeanor charges of assault, unlawful assembly, obstruction of governmental administration and resisting arrest. She was lauded as a hero at the rally after she violently opposed the construction of a men's shelter in the Gravesend neighborhood. Zhuang had spoken out last week blaming the episode on the NYPD. \"The excessive force by the NYPD was not necessary. I was very disappointed. There's no room for brutality or mistreatment of citizens by any officer. Police brutality is wrong. The misuse of enforcement is wrong. The act of physical violence against innocent citizens is wrong,\" Zhuang said. \"Many members of the Asian community have been subject to excessive enforcement and mistreatment by our NYPD. Asian hate in any form must end,\" she had added.\n\nSome in the council feel her behavior was less than heroic. One council source called Zhuang a \"dangerous liar\" after seeing the translated social media messages on WeChat, per the Post. \"Susan is a dangerous liar who loves to play victim, she knows exactly what she is doing here,\" the source said.\n\nYing Tan, who ran against Zhuang for the city council seat last year, also spoke out, accusing Zhuang of falsely stating that the NYPD used \"unreasonable force against her\" during the shelter protest. \"It is reckless and irresponsible to spread false information to constituents in an attempt to avoid accountability for her own actions,\" Tan wrote on Facebook.\n\nA spokesperson for Zhuang insisted that the lawmaker was \"not involved in the logistics for planning this event\" despite her advice to protesters on WeChat. \"The council member was supporting the NYPD as she always has and was advocating for safety of her community,\" the Rep said. \"This is yet another attempt by her detractors to divide the AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders) community and silence their voice.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the council member also responded to her former opponent's comments. \"In this moment we should put our own political agenda aside and focus on lifting Asian voices across the city,\" the spokesperson said.", "source": {"uri": "tjvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish Voice"}, "authors": [{"uri":

However, the protest has drawn significant attention not only for its size but also for its organizers' connections to the Chinese Communist Party .\n\nThe march, which began at Foley Square and ended at Cadman Plaza Park, saw protesters holding signs with slogans such as \"save our community\" and \"equal justice for Susan Zhuang.\" The demonstration was organized by John Chan, head of BRACE, a non-profit group linked to the United Front, a CCP-affiliated organization aimed at spreading communism globally.\n\nChan, also known as Chen Shanzhuang, is a Chinese-born businessman who leads the American Chinese Commerce Association. His involvement has raised questions about the motives behind the rally. Despite Zhuang's attempt to distance herself from the organizers, stating she was not part of BRACE or its leadership, her office was found to have solicited donations for the group earlier this year. An email from her office invited supporters to a February Lantern Festival Parade, seeking sponsorship for the event attended by several elected officials, including Mayor Eric Adams.\n\nThis controversy comes at a time when Zhuang is under scrutiny for her actions during the Bensonhurst protest. According to her spokesperson, Zhuang intervened when she saw an elderly woman being pushed against barriers by the police. The confrontation led to her arrest on multiple charges, including assault and resisting arrest. \"Susan Zhuang was a victim that day, she was trying to protect a senior citizen,\" a speaker at the Sunday rally proclaimed, reinforcing the community's support for Zhuang.\n\nBreaking: Council Member Susan Zhuang was arrested this morning protesting a homeless shelter in her Brooklyn district. https://t.co/2tmU4x1Zt5 pic.twitter.com/CLEnsBCLc2\n\n-- Jeff Coltin (@JCColtin) July 17, 2024\n\nAs highlighted by a South Brooklyn political operative, Zhuang's influence within local politics is substantial, having helped Brooklyn Assemblymember Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn secure crucial district leader positions.

The district currently has no homeless shelters.\n\nAs first reported by The News, the Sunday march was co-organized by John Chan, a southern Brooklyn community advocate who has drawn scrutiny for his ties to China's Communist Party as well as for getting help from Zhuang's team to raise money for a local nonprofit group he operates.\n\nAsked about Chan's role in the march, Zhuang was quoted in a local report late Sunday as saying she is \"not part\" of his group and had \"not been part of planning\" the protest.\n\nBut texts Zhuang sent out Sunday morning to hundreds of constituents tell a different story.\n\nIn the texts, disseminated in a WeChat group just hours before the march got underway, Zhuang, a conservative Democrat, told constituents to not bring signs to the demonstration criticizing Mayor Eric Adams.\n\n\"Do not attack the mayor, we're going to have opportunity to sit down with him to negotiate,\" Zhuang wrote to the WeChat group, which has some 500 members, one of whom provided screengrabs of the messages to The News on condition of anonymity. \"This sign is no good for negotiations.\"\n\nIn a second message, Zhuang urged constituents to not \"clash with the police\" during the march. Both messages were written in Chinese and independently translated by The News.\n\nZhuang didn't return a request for comment Monday on the discrepancy between her public remarks and the WeChat messages.\n\nEsther Jensen, a rep from the Actum consulting firm Zhuang has hired to handle her communications operations, sought to clarify the nature of the Council member's involvement in the march when shown copies of the WeChat messages.\n\n\"The Council member was not involved in the logistics for planning this event,\" Jensen said. \"The Council member was supporting the NYPD as she always has, and was advocating for the safety of her community.\"\n\nIt's unclear from the messages what type of negotiations with the mayor Zhuang was referencing. Jensen would only say Zhuang is \"using her position as a public servant to collaborate with City Hall to best serve her constituents.\"\n\nSpokespeople for the mayor didn't immediately respond to emailed questions.\n\nTwo days after her arrest, Zhuang, who has styled herself as a pro-police lawmaker, met privately with the mayor at City Hall.\n\nThe mayor, who's politically aligned with Zhuang, has declined to say what they discussed in the meeting. He told reporters later on that he wants to help Zhuang \"resolve\" the criminal charges against her and the dispute over the shelter development in her district.\n\nZhuang, who has pleaded not guilty to the assault charges against her, maintains she was trying to help an elderly woman at the chaotic July 17 protest where she allegedly bit the chief.

The rally attracted a crowd of nearly 1,000 who spoke in favor of local authority over matters like shelter locations and supported Zhuang's claim to have been defending an elderly woman before the clash with police. The event was seemingly organized by businessman John Chan, who heads the Chinese government-linked nonprofit BRACE. Zhuang told the Post that she appreciated the support from protesters but was not affiliated with the organizers, saying, \"I am not part of BRACE or its leadership.

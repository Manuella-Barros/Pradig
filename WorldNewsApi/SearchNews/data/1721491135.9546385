Following the release of Normani\u2018s album Dopamine on Friday, her former groupmates Lauren Jauregui, Dinah Jane, and Camila Cabello shared sweet messages for the singer over the last few days. Dinah, who recently released her own solo track \u201cOcean Song,\u201d is the latest member to post about the LP. \u201cCongratulations on your first album release!! only bad bitches keep this on repeat,\u201d she wrote on Monday, before mentioning her favorite track on the album. \u201cTake My Time is my mooood AHHHHH!!!\u201d Meanwhile, Cabello and Jauregui shared comments on Normani\u2019s post about releasing the project over the weekend. Cabello wrote, \u201cPutting out a project is vulnerable and hard and you are doing it beautifully! Congratulations on your first album and many more to come.\u201d Normani replied to the comment and celebrated Cabello\u2019s own LP, C, XOXO, out later this month: \u201cThank you so much for this.

You\u2019re next, let\u2019s goooo.\u201d Jauregui kept her message simple writing, \u201cCongraaaaats bby girlllll.\u201d On X, she wrote, \u201cAHHHHH HAPPY DOPAMINE DAY BITCHESSS!!! LETS GO MANI????.\u201d Normani responded, \u201cIly v much mama.\u201d The only member yet to react to the record\u2019s release is Ally Brooke, who celebrated Normani, alongside all of the group\u2019s other members, when she announced the project earlier this year. In an interview with Rolling Stone earlier this month, Normani shared that she and Jauregui had just been texting. \u201cWhat a journey it\u2019s been,\u201d she said at the time. She also shared that she had \u201csuppressed\u201d some of her memories from being in the group after the struggles they went to as young adults. \u201cThat\u2019s just my way of protecting myself from having to deal with everything. But what I do remember is it wasn\u2019t all bad. Like yeah, we struggled, but it was also really beautiful in what we accomplished together,\u201d she said. The 5H girls\u2019 celebration of Normani\u2019s record also comes after Normani told Billboard that she sees a reunion as a \u201cpossibility in the future\u201d but the she was not aware of any plans of that happening anytime soon. Among the standouts on Dopamine are tracks such as \u201cAll Yours,\u201d \u201cLights On,\u201d \u201cBig Boy\u201d with Starrah, and \u201cInsomnia,\u201d which features background vocals from Brandy. \u201cAll over Dopamine, Normani owns her pleasure with the pride and confidence of the star she was always destined to be,\u201d read a Rolling Stone review of the record.", "summary": "Lauren Jauregui, Camila Cabello, and Dinah Jane shared sweet messages for the singer online", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/fifth-harmony-normani-dopamine-debut-album-1235041516/", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2157373278-1.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 01:03:04", "author": "Tom\u00e1s Mier", "authors": ["Tom\u00e1s Mier"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.373}

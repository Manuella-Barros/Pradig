What to know about weather forecast", "text": "The National Weather Service of Louisville is predicting severe weather Sunday, which could impact Jack Harlow's first Gazebo Festival and Memorial Day weekend activities. Multiple waves of storms are expected in the Louisville area, first in the early afternoon on Sunday and then later on Sunday night. Storms that could include heavy rain, lighting, thunder, and 40 mph winds could hit the downtown waterfront area between about 12 and 2 p.m., said Brian Schoettmer, forecaster for the National Weather Service's Louisville office. A second wave is expected around midnight. Wind speeds could top 75 mph, or \"hurricane force,\" upon occasion, Schoettmer said. He emphasized that people in mobile homes or who are camping should be especially careful on Sunday night, when the weather is expected to be most severe. \"All severe hazards are on the table,\" said Schoettmer. Threats include high winds, golf-ball-sized hail, tornadoes and flooding, which is most likely in the southern part of the state. The storms could last until early Monday morning. After a cloudy start on Memorial Day, it will be sunny later in the day with the temperature hitting 79, according to the National Weather Service's Louisville office. ?

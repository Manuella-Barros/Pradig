It also has financially supported events ranging from turkey giveaways to faith-based activities such as vaccination efforts and mentoring programs.\n\nWith donations and deliveries from DoorDash, a Chicago pastor and his church helped feed hundreds of unhoused people in its fellowship hall on a special \"Love Day\" and sent free meals to the homes of seniors and veterans.\n\nPastor Cornelius Parks said the connections with the food delivery company have enhanced his church's ability to reach out to the East Garfield Park neighborhood that he describes as a \"food desert,\" with scarce access to fresh food, grocery stores or mom-and-pop stores.\n\n\"If it wasn't for DoorDash really partnering with us, a lot of things that we desire to do for the community probably wouldn't come to pass because we're limited on resources,\" said Parks, the leader of Good Hope Freewill Baptist Church, a predominantly Black congregation where about 115 attend on Sundays. \"You still have to operate as a church, and you still have overhead. And even though you have members that show up, everyone is not giving like they used to.\"\n\nIn March, when Masbia Soup Kitchen Network in Brooklyn, New York, got an emergency shipment of frozen chicken wings that had a looming sell-by date, it coordinated with DoorDash motorcyclists to deliver the food from a tractor trailer whose contents were far too large for Masbia's limited freezer space.\n\nSome 2,500 families received food within eight hours, said Alexander Rapaport, a Hasidic Jew who is the executive director of the kosher soup kitchen.\n\n\"We have the trailer arrive and have staff and volunteers start breaking that up, putting into bags -- by the end of the day, they're all delivered,\" he said. \"Off the truck, into shopping bags and onto the motorcycles of the DoorDash.\"\n\nHe said his charity, which has received grants from DoorDash, also works with the delivery company to get meals to needy people, especially widowed and divorced mothers, so they do not have to leave home to receive a weekly family dinner and groceries such as fresh vegetables and fruit, rice and chicken. The soup kitchen also uses DoorDash for food deliveries to thousands during the holidays of Purim and Passover.\n\nA 2023 Urban Institute report said Project DoorDash was conceived during an employee hackathon in 2018 and included Dashers -- as DoorDash drivers are known -- being paid for their nonprofit-related deliveries.\n\nIt notes that DoorDash's arrangement at the time of the report was to forego profits on these deliveries, subsidizing the rate charged to nonprofits for delivery and sometimes assisting nonprofits in securing local funding to pay for their part of the cost of delivery.\n\n\"While a few partners have discontinued the service because they did not see a way to sustain it without full in-kind support, most have conveyed that they see home delivery as an essential component of their services in a way that many had not previously conceptualized before the pandemic,\" said the report, which was funded by DoorDash.\n\nKip Banks, senior impact strategist for Values Partnerships, a Washington-based organization that fosters collaborations to address the needs of urban communities, started about three years ago to set up listening sessions so DoorDash representatives could learn from faith leaders about community needs, such as homelessness, food insecurity and poverty. He said the funding partnerships that resulted have become a necessity for many churches.\n\n\"The post-pandemic church certainly is focused on, again, being relevant as a church to serve people,\" he said. \"But I think the church recognizes that in order to be effective, you cannot just rely upon the tithes and the offerings and only departments within the church. You have to partner with others outside of the church.\"\n\nThe Rev. David Wright, executive director of BMA TenPoint, which supports Black and Latino congregations in Boston, started working with DoorDash in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nUsing codes provided by the company, its affiliated churches have ordered food online at no cost to provide meals for people in need. Smaller churches were given gift cards to hand directly to those seeking help.\n\nHe estimates hundreds of families have been aided by the more than $25,000 in resources his organization has received from DoorDash.\n\n\"A lot of our churches are aging,\" said Wright, who is affiliated with the American Baptist Churches USA and is assistant to the pastor at Peoples Baptist Church of Boston.\n\n\"We have older people on fixed incomes, and across the board -- I can't say, especially in Black churches, but across the board -- churches haven't been good at attracting and retaining young people, and so the tithes and offerings just aren't allowing churches to be as generous with the community as they have been in the past.\"\n\nIn February, DoorDash, announced it had awarded more than $500,000 in grants to some 200 organizations providing social services for expenses related to home-delivery services.\n\nBeyond the work with faith-based and secular food pantries and congregations, DoorDash is also working with denominations and their affiliates on the regional and local level.\n\nThe Rev. David Peoples, president of the Progressive National Baptist Convention, estimated that DoorDash provides thousands of dollars in sponsorships to his historically Black denomination on an annual basis.\n\n\"It's a win-win for DoorDash to be good partners in the community,\" said Peoples, \"and a win-win for PNBC so that we could do ministry and not worry about money.\"", "source": {"uri": "religionnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Religion News Service"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adelle_m_banks@religionnews.com", "name": "Adelle M.

This initiative aims to streamline the process of handling requests for drivers' records, making it more efficient and convenient.\n\nThe company stated that it would also take into account the possibility of excluding drivers from the platform if law enforcement reports any violations of traffic laws.\n\nDoorDash has announced plans to launch a new initiative in Boston, with the potential for expansion to other cities in the future.\n\nDoorDash has announced its partnership with Boston and other cities to provide guidance on vehicle registration requirements in multiple languages. Additionally, it will alert delivery workers to actions that violate local laws, such as driving on sidewalks.\n\nREAD NEXT: Telstra Announces Mobile Plan Price Hikes Despite Previous CPI Pledge\n\nAuthorities in Boston, New York, and other cities have reported a concerning trend of drivers using unregistered vehicles for their delivery services. It is possible that certain drivers may share accounts, allowing individuals with multiple traffic violations to utilize a vehicle registered under someone else's name.\n\nAuthorities in New York have confiscated a staggering 13,000 scooters and mopeds this year. These vehicles were either unregistered or being used to violate traffic laws.\n\nIn light of the situation, DoorDash has announced that it will be implementing a new measure to ensure the safety and security of its delivery drivers. Going forward, drivers will be prompted more frequently to submit a real-time selfie to verify their identity during their delivery trips. The selfie is then cross-referenced with previously submitted government identification.\n\nDoorDash has announced that it will be taking action against drivers who do not verify their identities.

It began in 2018.\n\nIt involves DoorDash drivers dropping off free food to needy individuals in cities including New York, Boston, Chicago and San Diego, according to Religion News Service.\n\nA 2023 report from the Urban Institute explains that DoorDash makes no profits from its charitable deliveries. Neither do the organizations that partner with the company, including Jewish soup kitchens, Christian churches and large, faith-based nonprofits\n\n\"If it wasn't for DoorDash really partnering with us, a lot of things that we desire to do for the community probably wouldn't come to pass because we're limited on resources,\" said the Rev. Cornelius Parks, pastor of Good Hope Freewill Baptist Church, to Religion News Service.\n\nDoorDash has not limited drivers to delivering food. Gift cards and grants are included in the gifts.\n\nThe Rev. David Wright, who coordinates his Boston ministry with DoorDash, said that hundreds of families have benefitted from the tens of thousands of dollars DoorDash has gifted the community.\n\n\"A lot of our churches are aging,\" said the Rev. Wright to Religion News Service. \"We have older people on fixed incomes, and across the board -- I can't say, especially in Black churches, but across the board -- churches haven't been good at attracting and retaining young people, and so the tithes and offerings just aren't allowing churches to be as generous with the community as they have been in the past.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoorDash", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DoorDash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_News_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Religion News Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_San_Diego_Union-Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The San Diego Union-Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hunger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Urban Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soup_kitchen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soup kitchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_church", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tithe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptists", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baptists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free will"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritualism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritualism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Scientology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Scientology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Fictional", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/deseret_news_992/948914e88c56193f662a6d66622b95ef", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719459", "eventUri": "eng-9719459", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

It also has financially supported events ranging from turkey giveaways to faith-based activities such as vaccination efforts and mentoring programs.\n\nWith donations and deliveries from DoorDash, a Chicago pastor and his church helped feed hundreds of unhoused people in its fellowship hall on a special \"Love Day\" and sent free meals to the homes of seniors and veterans.\n\nPastor Cornelius Parks said the connections with the food delivery company have enhanced his church's ability to reach out to the East Garfield Park neighborhood that he describes as a \"food desert,\" with scarce access to fresh food, grocery stores or mom-and-pop stores.\n\n\"If it wasn't for DoorDash really partnering with us, a lot of things that we desire to do for the community probably wouldn't come to pass because we're limited on resources,\" said Parks, the leader of Good Hope Freewill Baptist Church, a pred ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoorDash", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DoorDash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soup_kitchen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soup kitchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_delivery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food delivery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Will_Baptist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free Will Baptist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashrut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kashrut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Garfield_Park,_Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Garfield Park, Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Garfield Park, Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_church", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_(bird)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turkey (bird)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mentorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_desert", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food desert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Small business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grocery store"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritualism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritualism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Scientology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Scientology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Fictional", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719459", "eventUri": "eng-9719459", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

The efforts coincide with what the company claimed is an established process for police working with its \"Law Enforcement Response Team.\"\n\nThe company says it plans to roll out the streamlined communication with its Law Enforcement Response Team to several other cities after launching in Boston.\n\nDelivery drivers risk removal from DoorDash if they break traffic laws, according to the company. In a letter obtained by MassLive, Boston Police Commissioner Michael Cox and Chief of Streets Jascha Franklin-Hodge wrote last month that there was an increase in illegal and \"dangerous\" motorcycle, moped and scooter driving.\n\nMany of the deliverers were using unregistered vehicles and driving on sidewalks, going the opposite direction of one-way streets, speeding and getting into accidents, according to the officials.\n\nOur residents' concerns echo those of City officials. We expect all companies operating in the City of Boston to prioritize the safety of our residents and visitors,\" the officials wrote. \"The consistent failure of those operating on your behalf to abide by rules and regulations indicates a concerning lack of oversight and care in regard to public safety.\"\n\nDoorDash said it has \"zero tolerance\" for dangerous driving and has collaborated with cities to support law enforcement efforts. The company also announced a public service announcement campaign to share warnings against law-breaking and guidance from public safety agencies about vehicle registration. DoorDash also plans to accelerate the account verification process for drivers.\n\nThe officials told DoorDash the city had begun distributing materials on the company's obligation to ensure drivers deliver safely and with registered vehicles.

All drivers will have to submit up-to-date photos of themselves for identification.\n\nDoorDash will also be putting out a new public service announcement to drivers about road safety.\n\n\"The new program is a good first start, there is more that can and should be done,\" said Franklin-Hodge. \"We are pushing delivery companies to be more accountable.\"\n\nCouncilors say they have started talking with MassDOT over common sense regulation such as mandatory vehicle registrations and insurance. They say it is possible, but companies refuse to do it. Franklin-Hodge says unregistered vehicles remain one of the biggest issues with enforcement.\n\nFranklin-Hodge was asked if mopeds could be banned for delivery drivers. He said that car-only deliveries would only further traffic problems.\n\n\"On Boylston Street in the Back Bay, we are testing a dedicated parking area for two-wheeled delivery vehicles,\" he said.\n\nThe dedicated parking area aims to fix moped build-up around street curbs.\n\n\"We cannot wait while our busiest streets become more clogged with delivery vehicles,\" he said. \"We can't sit by while a multibillion dollar industry profits, while looking the other way as its workforce ignores the rules of the road.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moped", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moped"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoorDash", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DoorDash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Police_Department", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Police Department"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidewalk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sidewalk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian_crossing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedestrian crossing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedestrian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motorcycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Bay,_Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Back Bay, Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Back Bay, Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grubhub", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grubhub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_delivery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food delivery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service_announcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public service announcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_traffic_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Road traffic safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintendent_(police)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superintendent (police)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_(motorcycle)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scooter (motorcycle)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boylston_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boylston Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Department_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Department of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_lot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parking lot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Traffic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices/Car-Free", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices/Car-Free", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Big_Dig", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Big Dig", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Offroad_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Offroad Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/10/11edd7b7-46c2-40bd-a290-85f716793441/thumbnail/1200x630/0bcda9b8a5125352190d53791f44f2ed/mopeds.jpg?v=2287029998c5246c93d6dd038eb30603", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719459", "eventUri": "eng-9719459", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

If a judge in Texas accepts the deal, Boeing won't have to go on trial. The plea deal was disclosed in a court filing late Sunday. It's not yet a sure thing, however. Relatives of some of the passengers who died in the Max crashes have indicated they will ask a federal judge to throw out the agreement. Under the deal, Boeing will pay another fine, bringing the total to $487.2 million, and be required to invest at least $455 million in making additional safety improvements.\n\nUnder pressure from cities, DoorDash steps up efforts to ensure its drivers don't break traffic laws\n\nDoorDash says it's stepping up efforts to identify dangerous delivery drivers and remove them from its platform after a flood of complaints from cities. In a letter sent last month to DoorDash and other food delivery companies, Boston officials said they were seeing an increase in the unlawful and dangerous operation of motorcycles, mopeds and motorized scooters by delivery workers. San Francisco-based DoorDash said on Tuesday that it has created a dedicated point of contact for the Boston Police Department to make it faster and easier to process requests for drivers' records. If it's successful, the action may expand to other cities.\n\nMilk, eggs and now bullets for sale in handful of US grocery stores with ammo vending machines\n\nMONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- A company has installed vending machines that sell ammunition in grocery stores in Alabama, Oklahoma, and Texas, raising concerns among gun control advocates. American Rounds company officials say the machines use an identification scanner and facial recognition software to verify age. The company's CEO says the technology makes the transaction at least as secure as online purchases. But activists say these safety measures belong in gun stores, not in places where families buy groceries. They worry gun violence will increase in a country where there have been 15 mass killings involving a firearm so far in 2024. On July Fourth alone, at least 33 people died in gun violence across the country.\n\nA driverless car hits a person crossing against the light in China\n\nBEIJING (AP) -- A driverless ride-hailing car in China hit a pedestrian, and people on social media are taking the carmaker's side, because the person was reportedly crossing against the light. Chinese tech giant Baidu said in a statement to Chinese media that its car began moving when the light turned green and had minor contact with the pedestrian. Images posted online show a person sitting on the street in front of the driverless car with its rooftop sensors. The Chinese financial news outlet Yicai said the incident on Sunday in the city of Wuhan highlights the challenge that autonomous driving faces in complex situations.", "source": {"uri":

The company said it would also consider removing drivers from the platform if police report they have broken traffic laws.\n\nDoorDash said it was starting the effort in Boston but may expand it to other cities.\n\nDoorDash said it's also partnering with Boston and other cities to share guidance on vehicle registration requirements in multiple languages. It will also warn delivery workers about activities that break local laws, like driving on sidewalks.\n\n\"We will remind Dashers that failing to comply with local laws or our standards could lead to removal from our platform,\" the company said.\n\nOfficials in Boston, New York and other cities have said that in many cases, drivers are using unregistered vehicles for deliveries. Some drivers may also share accounts, so a person with multiple traffic violations might be using a vehicle registered to someone else.\n\nIn New York, authorities have seized 13,000 scooters and mopeds so far this year that were unregistered or used to break traffic laws.\n\n\"They have terrorized many of our pedestrians, particularly our senior and older adults,\" New York City Mayor Eric Adams said last month at an event where 200 motorized two-wheeled delivery vehicles were destroyed. \"Riders who think the rules don't apply to them, they're going to see an aggressive enforcement policy that's in place.\"\n\nIn response, DoorDash said it will more frequently prompt drivers to submit a real-time selfie to prove their identity while they're making deliveries. The selfie is then compared to previously submitted government identification.\n\nDoorDash said it would remove drivers who fail to confirm their identities.\n\nDoorDash wouldn't say how many drivers it typically removes from its platform each year for breaking traffic laws.", "source": {"uri": "inc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inc.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@inc.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoorDash", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DoorDash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_delivery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food delivery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorized_scooter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motorized scooter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_traffic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "One-way traffic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moped", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moped"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidewalk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sidewalk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motorcycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Police_Department", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Police Department"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Traffic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_limit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speed limit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_New_York_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of New York City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_(motorcycle)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scooter (motorcycle)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pedestrian"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Driving", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Driving", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Drivers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Drivers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device_Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device Drivers", "wgt": 36}], "image": "https://img-cdn.inc.com/image/upload/w_1024,h_576,c_fill/images/panoramic/doordash-2155565359_542667_favavg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719459", "eventUri": "eng-9719459", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 458399950, "relevance": 2}

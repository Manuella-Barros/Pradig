They will attempt to right the wrongs in Sunday's decider against Donegal at Clones.\n\nRead more: Armagh vs Donegal: GAA provide Ulster Final ticket update ahead of Sunday's showdown\n\nRead more: What channel is Armagh vs Donegal on? TV and live stream info for Sunday's Ulster Senior Football Championship Final\n\n\"We were very close and probably should have won it in normal time,\" accepts defender Burns. \"As it turned out it was a very good Derry team, but it's not often you get an opportunity to undo it or give yourself a chance to undo it.\n\n\"That's definitely a big thought for us. Lets go out and give ourselves a shot at doing what we should have done last year.\"\n\nWhen asked whether winning it for their manager was a serious driving force, Burns claimed: \"Absolutely - you always want to go out and win something for him because while we put a lot of time in as players, being an inter-county manager is such a difficult job.\n\n\"For the time he has put in to us, everything he's done for us, how well he looks after us, the least we can do is get him an Ulster title. And we'll be going out to do that for him, absolutely.\"\n\nBurns missed last year's Ulster Championship through injury and feels he has earned the right to have a shot at winning a major trophy. Like more senior players like Rory Grugan, Aidan Forker and Stefan Campbell, the 31 year old is part of an Armagh team that has knocked on the door for a while now, so is their time?\n\n\"That has always been the question, you always assume that it is your time,\" Burns says. \"We are getting to the point where it is time we did something but all we can do is our best on the day.\n\n\"We have come up against some great teams and some great performances over the last four or five years that have put us out by the odd point or penalties here and there.\n\n\"We will just go out and give it our all to ensure this is our time, but it is a difficult animal we are coming up against, so the game isn't going to go your way all the time.\n\n\"You have to be able to respond whenever they have their purple patch. No team is going to go 70-minutes without having a good spell, so you just have go in knowing that you have to try and limit how effective they are when they have their spell and then try and respond.\"\n\nArmagh did just that in a last gasp win over Down in the Ulster semi-final two weeks ago. Subs Oisin O'Neill, Aidan Nugent and Jason Duffy kicked the last three points, Duffy's winner coming deep into stoppage time, in a dogged 0-13 to 2-6 win over the Mournemen.\n\nThe main positive Armagh could take from a below-par display, when none of their six starting forwards scored from play, was that they had found a way to drag themselves over the winning line.\n\n\"Down, to their credit, went out with a game-plan and executed it very well and it almost came off for them,\" Burns admitted.\n\n\"We maybe tried to force the last pass or had poor wides and it became that game of a dogfight. So, were we happy with the performance? No, we didn't do a lot of the basic things that we are good at.\n\n\"However, we pulled the game out in the last five to ten minutes which is something we haven't done in a while. I think all in all, you gave to take the positives from that game too and that was that we closed out a tight game. Some of the forwards had a bad weekend, that happens, but we still found a way to win.\"\n\nTwo of the best-supported teams in Ulster will collide on Sunday with Donegal a resurgent force now that Jim McGuinness is back in charge for the first time since 2014.\n\nHe has won 15 out of 16 matches in the competition and Donegal expects. Yet there's a sense in Armagh that have to make it count this time, which could heap unwanted pressure on the players.\n\n\"To an extent, as long as you can handle it, pressure is healthy,\" insists Burns. \"If you feel pressure, it means you care about what you are doing and other people care about what you are doing - if there is no pressure on you, then you are probably not in the hunt or even interested.\n\n\"Armagh fans are, in the most positive sense of the word, mental - in that they follow us everywhere. There were so many games in Division Two where our away support was so much bigger than the home support, so we are very lucky. That just tells you how much they are willing us on to win something.\n\n\"For me I have the benefit of not living in Armagh, I live in Burren in Down, so there is a bit less of the chatter around me. I don't hear as much as the boys might going to the shop or doing different things around Armagh. It is both pressure and propulsion for us to push on and have a good energy about what we are trying to do.\"\n\nSign up to our free sports newsletter to get the latest headlines to your inbox", "source": {"uri": "belfastlive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "orla_bannon@belfastlive.co.uk", "name": "Orla Bannon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(Gaelic_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (Gaelic games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Senior_Football_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ulster Senior Football Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donegal_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donegal GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ulster"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ulster"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armagh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Armagh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Armagh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derry", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Derry"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derry"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clones,_County_Monaghan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clones, County Monaghan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_McGeeney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kieran McGeeney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Counties of Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anglo-Celt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Anglo-Celt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Senior_Football_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-Ireland Senior Football Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaelic Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aidan_Nugent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aidan Nugent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-county", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inter-county"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Duffy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shane Duffy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burren_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burren GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_McGuinness", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim McGuinness"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i2-prod.belfastlive.co.uk/sport/gaa/gaelic-football/article29134382.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_DSC03153.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552089", "eventUri": "eng-9552089", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

It's hard to see anything other than Dublin steamrolling to another Leinster title, but in Clones on Sunday it is like splitting hairs to pick a winner between Armagh and Donegal.\n\nWithout any disrespect to Louth, I'm not sure there is much point in dwelling on the Leinster final.\n\nGer Brennan has done a brilliant job, coming in after the Mickey Harte exit and the doom and gloom that surrounded that. They more than acquitted themselves well in Division 2 and are back in a second successive provincial decider.\n\nIf Louth can hold tight and be in the game for 20, 25 minutes, is that an achievement in itself? It's not even a great thing to say, but that's the reality.\n\nThe question I'd have is how much damage will Sunday inflict on them going into the group stages?\n\nThat's the challenge for Brennan and his team, can they recover well enough as I expect a defeat of at least 15 points.\n\nLast Sunday in Ennis showed what can happen when the venue at least plays in favour of the underdog. Kerry never looked seriously in danger of losing the Munster final, but the game at least was competitive, played out in a cracking atmosphere. At the very least, it had some semblance of an occasion worthy of a provincial decider.\n\nIt's not what we are likely to witness at GAA HQ on Sunday.\n\nTeams might say they want to play in Croke Park, but it's not benefitting them in any way, shape or form. You should earn your crust, earn your right to play in Croke Park.\n\nI think Dublin themselves are sick of playing in Croke Park for Leinster games where there is no atmosphere or crowd.\n\nThey constantly say they would love nothing more than playing around the country, but the one-sided nature of Leinster in the last decade has effectively rendered these games meaningless.\n\nThe margin is all that is in doubt, not the result.\n\nThat is a world away from the Ulster match-up between Donegal and Armagh, where the figures of Kieran McGeeney and Jim McGuinness loom over the fixture.\n\nDonegal's march to the final represents a huge turnaround in just 12 months. It's like two different worlds. Last year they suffered a spring relegation, bowed meekly out of Ulster and sandwiched in between saw manager Paddy Carr depart after just seven months at the helm.\n\nNow back in Division 1, McGuinness is rightly getting all the plaudits as he has changed the narrative around the team entirely.\n\nThe chests are out and they are full of confidence. That's the McGuinness effect, maximising output from each and every player.\n\nHe is making them believe they can do things they couldn't do last year.\n\nOn paper, Armagh look better on paper in terms of personnel, but collectively, the way McGuinness has got Donegal playing, they are perhaps stronger collectively.\n\nThey got promoted from Division 2 minus three or four of their best players, so the squad depth is improving.\n\nOn top of all that, McGuinness and Ulster have a love affair like no other. A record of 15 wins from 16 Ulster games (the sole defeat coming at the hands of Monaghan in the 2013 decider) speaks for itself.\n\nLooking at Armagh, individually they have a really talented forward line. They are dangerous in one-on-one situations and in Rory Grugan - pictured above - they have a player who knits it all together.\n\nIf they can get enough ball to him, he can create havoc.\n\nBut my gut instinct tells me that having watched Tyrone frustrate Donegal last time out, the Orchard County will make it a complete borefest, 15 players behind the ball.\n\nTyrone showed that if the game gets into a bit of a stalemate, a possession-based game, it takes away a lot of Donegal's armoury because they love to break fast and with numbers.\n\nIf you get turned over, Donegal are gone. You saw that with the long kickouts against Derry, but Tyrone made sure that didn't happen. They dropped deep and invited Donegal onto them.\n\nI can see it being a tough, tight affair, but possibly not living up to the billing. I just can't see teams going toe-to-toe in an attacking sense.\n\nA team may have to show some degree of risk coming down the stretch and I'm a firm believer the team that takes the greater degree of risk prevails.\n\nThat safe, monotonous, build-up is not enough to win an All-Ireland, but it might be enough Sunday. At some stage on Sunday, a team in Clones will have to throw caution to the wind.\n\nIf you look at the Division 2 final, when Armagh came up short against Sunday's opponents, they threw the shackles off in the last 10, 15 minutes and looked a really dangerous team.\n\nI feel Armagh are at a crossroads. They have lost out some big games by fine margins and Kieran McGeeney is in his 10th season in charge.\n\nEven the Division 2 final, it was another final and many tipped them to win. Because they didn't, I think there is huge pressure on Armagh to deliver.\n\nIf that need isn't clearly on display on Sunday, I'd question where they are going as a group.\n\nUlster success is crucial given their All-Ireland quarter-final defeats the last two years, not to mention last year's Ulster decider.\n\nMcGeeney has done brilliant things with the Orchard County, getting them operating at an elite level, but he has no silverware to show for it. To get to the net level, winning a big game and in particular, an Ulster final, is what is needed.\n\nWhile such talk among supporters and in the media is generally batted away by players, perhaps it has more of an impact on the men in charge.\n\nAs a player, you're always aware of that pressure. If the group is strong enough, it's well controlled. Regardless, you're solely focused on the performance and result.\n\nYou have to embrace that pressure. If I was an Armagh player this weekend, the buzz of going to Clones, playing such a Donegal team, there is no need to pay any heed to the outside noise.\n\nThat pressure might weigh heavier on McGeeney's shoulders. Look at last Sunday in Salthill and Galay manager Padraic Joyce referencing the criticism of his team in a number of interviews.\n\nI found that fascinating, it seemed like a sort of release valve. I'm sure he told the players it doesn't matter, but it clearly all that chatter had an impact on him.\n\nI'm leaning to Armagh because of the greater need.\n\nI just can't see how they don't really go for it on Sunday. I don't think they are in the All-Ireland conversation, but it would solidify the team's credentials and gives the group a huge building block.\n\nWatch the Leinster Football Championship final,

TV and live stream info for Sunday's Ulster Senior Football Championship Final\n\nNow in his tenth year as Armagh manager, McGeeney finds McGuinness and Donegal standing in the way of much-coveted Ulster title.\n\nMcGeeney is revered in his native county as Armagh's All-Ireland winning captain of 2002. A three-time All-Star, he is regarded as one of the game's all-time great defenders.\n\nWhile he won six Ulster titles as a player, the Anglo Celt Cup has eluded McGeeney as a manager and there's a overwhelming sense that it is now or never.\n\nArmagh's loyal fanbase are the envy of many counties, but their patience isn't infinite. It took Armagh five attempts to win an Ulster Championship game under McGeeney's reign with Donegal handing him his first loss in 2015.\n\nSlowly, but surely the tide began to turn for the Mullaghbawn native, although their first appearance back in the Ulster final since 2008 ended with a penalty shootout loss to Derry last season. Armagh supporters won't be as forgiving if they leave Clones without the Anglo Celt on Sunday.\n\nMcGeeney's reign has yielded 21 Championship victories in 39 outings. McGuinness has won 22 Championship games from 26 as Donegal boss. Only one of his four losses has been in Ulster - the 2013 Ulster Final defeat to Monaghan.\n\nMcGuinness is still in the infancy of his second term. A Division Two title and the scalp of Derry in the Ulster first round has seen Donegal's stock soar. In the Hills, they don't need convincing of McGuinness's brilliance.\n\nIn that sense, the burden of expectation, undoubtedly, rests on McGeeney's shoulders on Sunday. Of the two managers, McGeeney has a point to prove.\n\nFor the second successive season, the draw has been unmercifully kind to them. Last year, they defeated Antrim, Cavan and Down to reach the provincial final - this year they faced Fermanagh and Down en-route to the final.\n\nLast year, they were coming up against the defending champions Derry, a team now considered to be among the best in Ireland. On Sunday, they are facing a team of equals. In two competitive outings in 2024, one point has separated Armagh and Donegal.\n\nIn the 10 years McGeeney has been at the helm, Armagh have not had a better chance of winning an Ulster title than they do this weekend. He needs to find a way of stopping Jimmy from winning matches. History has shown that's easier said than done.\n\nSign up to our free sports newsletter to get the latest headlines to your inbox", "source": {"uri": "belfastlive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paddy_tierney@belfastlive.co.uk", "name": "Paddy Tierney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_McGeeney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kieran McGeeney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_McGuinness", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jim McGuinness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kildare_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kildare GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ulster"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ulster"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Donegal", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "County Donegal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "County Donegal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armagh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Armagh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Armagh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(Gaelic_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (Gaelic games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Senior_Football_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ulster Senior Football Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_McDonnell_(Gaelic_footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steven McDonnell (Gaelic footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Cassidy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Cassidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Counties of Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterkenny", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letterkenny"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Letterkenny"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newbridge,_County_Kildare", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newbridge, County Kildare"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newbridge, County Kildare"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(Gaelic_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (Gaelic games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clones,_County_Monaghan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clones, County Monaghan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAA_GPA_All_Stars_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GAA GPA All Stars Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Senior_Football_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-Ireland Senior Football Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derry", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derry"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derry"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mullaghbawn", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mullaghbawn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mullaghbawn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermanagh_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fermanagh GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaghan_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monaghan GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antrim_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antrim GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavan_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cavan GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Netball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Netball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.belfastlive.co.uk/sport/gaa/gaelic-football/article29142057.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_inpho_02454117.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552089", "eventUri": "eng-9552089", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

There was also no cameo role from Paddy McBrearty required.\n\nArmagh didn't start with Rian O'Neill or Stefan Campbell that day, while Jason Duffy and Oisin O'Neill weren't used at all.\n\nLittle did we know at the time, but this was merely a dress rehearsal for an Ulster final pairing later in the year.\n\nNo full hands were on display and the Division Two showpiece was only settled by a stoppage-time point from Aaron Doherty.\n\nMake no mistake - these are two very evenly-matched sides and we can't really look to that result for any chinks of what could happen on Sunday.\n\nYet, from an Armagh perspective, what will they have learned about Donegal in the Championship to date and how might that influence how they approach this decider?\n\nIt might sound simple and, at the same time, a broad brush statement, but not allowing Donegal to dictate the game on their terms will be key for McGeeney's men.\n\nLet's delve a little deeper and reflect on how both Derry and Tyrone fell exactly into that trap against them, particularly on kick-outs.\n\nThe continued and reckless full press on the Shaun Patton kick-out by Derry was destructive and allowed the game to develop into a helter-skelter contest of anarchy that cost the Oak Leafers three goals.\n\nThis was exactly what McGuinness had planned for, albeit he could never have imagined it would work as emphatically.\n\nNext day out, with Patton injured, the Red Hands offered up the kick-out and invited Donegal onto them. Tyrone missed an opportunity to test a rookie goalkeeper making his full Championship debut.\n\nThe net result was that Donegal had 13 more shots at goal than their opponents. A completely different game, but again played on their terms.\n\nAt this stage it is unclear whether Patton will have recovered in time from injury to regain his place from Gavin Mulreany - but if he is fit he will start.\n\nThis uncertainty will have added a little more stress to the Armagh preparations as a plan for Mulreany will look very different from the one for Patton.\n\nIf the latter is in goal, Armagh still need to pick their moments to exercise a press of sorts, but it would be a guarded one that will involve at least one spare man out the back and lots of scrambling when the ball is mid-flight.\n\nBen Crealey, Rian O'Neill, Shane McPartlan, and perhaps Andrew Murnin, will be a quartet used to match the towering quartet of Jason McGee, Michael Langan, Ciaran Thompson and Caolan McGonigle to ensure the ball breaks the favourable side of their midfield.\n\nPossession gained from any long deliveries can be oxygen to the Armagh attacking game.\n\nHow they set up defensively and press the ball is also going to be hugely important. While Derry offered meadows of green grass for Donegal to run into, Tyrone did the opposite and set up a very low-block defence.\n\nArmagh should look for balance in the first phase of their defending by getting a little more pressure on the ball between the two 50s.\n\nTyrone didn't have a counter-attacking game because they didn't force any turnovers in the tackle.\n\nArmagh need to be less cagey and go for the kill when the chance is there. Counter-attacks will be necessary and that can be another string to the Armagh bow.\n\nArmagh manager Kieran McGeeney also faces a tough dilemma this weekend, with first-choice goalkeeper Ethan Rafferty now fully fit again after recovering from an ankle injury.\n\nHis replacement, Blaine Hughes, has been in fine form though, conceding just two goals in nine League and Championship matches in 2024. I expect Hughes to start, but don't rule out a cameo appearance from Rafferty, which could be a massive injection to the Armagh attack come the last 20 minutes.\n\nIn the same way Donegal wanted the Derry game to be fast, furious and manic, Armagh have to find a way for the tempo to be high at stages.\n\nIf it's pedestrian, attritional, and methodical then McGuinness will be rubbing his hands - and I'd expect Donegal to win.\n\nThe facts are that Donegal are unbeaten in nine games through the course of 2024 says plenty. Jimmy's winning matches.\n\nThe form would point to a likely Donegal victory as question marks remain over Armagh being able to take out a formidable opponent whenever they need to.\n\nFormer Donegal star John Gildea pulled no punches in yesterday's edition when he told us that very fact.\n\nIn his 10th season in charge, the pressure is being heaped on McGeeney to finally deliver an Ulster title.\n\nI believe Armagh can win - but to do so they must show a little more courage and a little less caution.", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Donegal", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "County Donegal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "County Donegal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armagh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Armagh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Armagh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "EFL Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrone_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyrone GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derry", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Derry"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derry"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Doherty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Doherty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_McCole", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brendan McCole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Duffy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shane Duffy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_McHugh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan McHugh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_McGuinness", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim McGuinness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_McBrearty", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick McBrearty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_McGee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason McGee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_Patton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shaun Patton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulster"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ulster"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_McGeeney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kieran McGeeney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(Gaelic_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (Gaelic games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_football,_hurling_and_camogie_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaelic football, hurling and camogie positions"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.irishnews.com/resizer/v2/V6KWLWZTZNB6PGKG37A77W7RR4.jpg?smart=true&auth=c9f97935840055fd47bad17dd519f3dae00a2a66313ec19c5a301f3485a516b1&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552089", "eventUri": "eng-9552089", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

One of ABP Foods' biggest clients was going bust.\n\n\"I was sent to try to get money out of him,\" Walsh says. Two days later, he was scheduled to keep goal for Donegal in the Ulster final against Armagh.\n\nNow, he found himself at Smithfield Market and in all sorts of races against the ticking clock.\n\n\"It wasn't the best of places to find yourself in,\" he says.\n\n\"It was a case of trying to take what you can out of it. At times like that, you'd maybe have to try to get lorries to come and take whatever to cover the debt.\"\n\nWalsh missed a team meeting with the Donegal squad on the Friday night.\n\nTwenty four hours later, Walsh went straight to Bundoran and joined manager Brian McEniff at Gaelic Park \"for a few kicks and handling exercises.\"\n\nOn July 15, 1990, Walsh kept a clean sheet as Donegal won 0-15 to 0-14; champions of Ulster for only the fourth time.\n\nThat Clones afternoon 34 years ago was bubbling nicely but Tony Boyle - who had yet to play competitively for Donegal - was growing restless.\n\nMcEniff, back for a latest sojourn in the hot seat, drafted a 19-year-old Boyle into his panel after the Dungloe youngster came back from America in 1989.\n\nHis Donegal career - which would eventually span 107 games - almost ended, at his own behest, before it began, but the 1990 Ulster final offered Boyle his first taste.\n\n\"I was chomping at the bit,\" Boyle recalled. \"I was mad for action.\"\n\nBoyle headed to warm up in front of the hill, but soon began to lose patience.\n\nBoyle took matters into his own hands and informed Noreen Doherty, the county secretary, of an impending change.\n\n\"McEniff didn't seem as if he was going to do anything. At the next break in play, I bolted on without anyone telling me.\"\n\nBoyle set up a crucial point for Manus Boyle in the closing stages as Donegal took another big step towards their ultimate goal.\n\nIt was still two summers before Sam Maguire would voyage north westerly, but the building blocks were being laid.\n\nMany in Donegal will point to a qualifier annihilation by Armagh in Crossmaglen in 2010 as being a real turning point. It marked the entry of Jim McGuinness to the senior manager's role and paved the way for a glorious era.\n\nWind back to 1988 and an Ulster opener against Armagh in Clones also proved to be a key point in it all.\n\nJune 12, 1988 stands out in the annals of Irish sport: it was the day Ray Houghton scored to give the Republic of Ireland a win over England in Stuttgart in 1988.\n\n\"The biggest cheer came when the crowd heard that Ireland had scored,\" John Joe Doherty, who made his Championship debut that afternoon, would remember some years later.\n\nPaul Callaghan, later to become Donegal's goalkeeper, was in the crowd with some friends from Burt and mischievously started a rumour that England had equalised.\n\nIn the era before smart phones and on-the-go access to such info, many left Clones believing Callaghan's tall tale. It was about the only thing to make Donegal smile with Armagh blasting to a 2-10 to 0-8 win.\n\n\"One of the worst performances in living memory,\" scathed Damian Dowds and Donal Campbell in Sam's For The Hills some 25 years later.\n\n\"We got something of a revitalisation from 1989 and all of that moved us on into '92,\" says Walsh.\n\n\"I was left off the squad in '87 and in '88 things weren't great. It was all down to attitude, I think. Armagh gave us a good beating that day, but Armagh were a good side.\n\n\"Our own camp wasn't in great shape and some boys were pissing about, but we showed in the following years what could be done if everyone put the knee to the wagon.\n\n\"A lot of it was down to player attitude. If you take the 1982 All-Ireland-winning U21 team, they were knocking around for a few years and the '87 team was coming through. That was the backbone of '92 and we didn't even know it.\"\n\nA look back at the 1988 game shows that 18 of the players used by Tom Connaghan in the Armagh defeat would be All-Ireland winners only four years later.\n\nIt was something of a similar tale from the crumbled Donegal McGuinness inherited in 2010; just two years later, most climbed the steps of the Hogan Stand.\n\n\"Jim has turned Donegal around with attitude, effort and just buying into it,\" Walsh says.\n\n\"I thought this might've taken Jim another year to really build things. It was a bonus to get out of Division 2 in the first year and I would say that Donegal are maybe ahead of schedule.\n\n\"Confidence is what this is all about -and momentum. They have taken real belief from Jim and they're clearly fitter.\n\n\"Ryan McHugh is a revelation this year, Ciaran Moore is in as young blood and been outstanding and other players are coming back in at the right time.\n\n\"There is real positivity about the place and you can see that Jim has the plan.\"\n\nIn the years from 2002 to 2007, Donegal and Armagh met every year in the Championship. There were seven meetings with Armagh winning five and a drawn encounter in 2004 thrown in.\n\n\"When a team without a plan meets a team that is so well drilled to plan, the outcome is kind of inevitable,\" Brendan Devenney recalled of that period.\n\n\"It was a wee bit personal. I got wild angry at the Armagh thing. They kept cutting off channels and had three men around you to tackle. At that stage, there weren't many teams doing it. It's annoying to think that we were so tactically inept.\"\n\nIn 2004, Donegal were reduced to 12 men - Eamon McGee, Brian Roper and Adrian Sweeney were all sent off - by the time Devenney landed a late goal.\n\nArmagh steam-rolled to a 3-11 to 1-10 win and Joe Brolly, speaking on RTE, likened Devenney's goal to 'the wasp stinging the elephant'.\n\nDevenney did get a late goal to give Donegal a dramatic win in 2007 on a scorching afternoon in Ballybofey.\n\n\"We didn't deserve to win any of them,\" he said.\n\n\"Even the game we did beat them, Armagh were on the money, tactically and every way. They knocked us about that day and looked like they were ready for another All-Ireland push.\n\n\"Armagh had the strength training and they had the system. Donegal would need to have played them 10 times to beat them once - and even that was only a maybe. Everything Armagh did was based on winning a football match.\n\n\"Donegal was the perfect team for them to keep playing and keep beating. We were just too nice to play against.\"\n\nDonegal and Armagh have always been able to serve up some sharp encounters. Controversy has never been far away. There was the 2014 'flying doctor' episode at Croke Park, an incident that involved Donegal doctor Kevin Moran and Aaron Findon.\n\n\"My overriding concern is always and only the safety of the players on the field, and in that particular case, my sole aim was to protect Karl Lacey,\" Mr Moran said the following week.\n\nThere was a tempestuous meeting in Letterkenny in 2022, a year that closed for Donegal at the hands of Armagh and a 3-17 to 0-16 loss in Clones.\n\nAnyway, who said defensive football was a modern creation?\n\nDonegal hosted Armagh in Ballyshannon in the Ulster Championship of 1928. A crowd of over 2,000 witnessed Armagh leave with a 1-8 to 1-4 win on a day when Donegal trailed by 1-5 to no score at half-time.\n\n\"They adopted defensive rather than aggressive tactics,\" the Democrat reported 96 years ago. \"Pressure, however, was never so strenuous as to warrant a whole-time defence and with a little more attacking in the early stages, Donegal might have done better.\"\n\nThe year previous, the Democrat outlined that 60 supporters from Ballyshannon and 30 from Bundoran travelled on the excursion train to Armagh with the Donegal team.\n\nDonegal lost 0-8 to 1-1 and the reporter bemoaned Donegal's greed for goals: \"Instead of all the time looking for goals, had they tried for points against Armagh, the result might have been different.\"", "source":

Five years running, they met Joe Kernan's side. Across three Ulster finals, an All-Ireland semi-final and a first-round replay, Donegal just could not beat them. Cahair O'Kane charts the story of that forgotten Donegal team...\n\nTHERE aren't even three minutes gone in the Ulster final. Diarmuid Marsden swings a leg at one from beneath the fringe of the Gerry Arthurs.\n\nHesitation. Noel McGinley doesn't call it. Tony Blake doesn't call it. They let it bounce. Blake has to put a hand up to stop it hopping over but in doing so, palms it down for John McEntee to steal in and punch it into the net.\n\nIt is July 2002.\n\nJoe Kernan had won three All-Ireland club titles in four years with Crossmaglen. This was his first big day on the line with an Armagh team that had already been testing the strength of the All-Ireland's doorframe.\n\nMcEntee's goal was just enough. Donegal kicked 14 wides. Jim McGuinness's goal was just that little bit too late for them to pull themselves up on.\n\nArmagh are Ulster champions. Two months later, the All-Ireland too.\n\n________________________________________\n\nARMAGH have had Donegal in a headlock for five years now. Beaten them every year.\n\n2002, '03, '04, '05 and '06.\n\nThis is '07. It looks no different with 90 seconds to go. Not just Donegal for that matter. They haven't been able to back up their one All-Ireland but they go to Ballybofey unbeaten in the Ulster Championship since a preliminary round defeat to Monaghan 1,477 days ago.\n\nDonegal were league champions for the first time in their history. Armagh were 7/4 underdogs with the bookies. The once steady ground beneath their feet was cracking with each passing week.\n\nThey sent 2,000 tickets of their allocation back to Ulster Council.\n\n\"I am very disappointed with Armagh supporters, they should be ashamed of themselves for letting these boys down,\" Joe Kernan said afterwards.\n\nBut with 90 seconds to go, it looks no different.\n\nThe league champions are 1-8 to 0-9 down when Brendan Devenney fires a blind arrow into the sky.\n\nIt drops just beneath the crossbar. Kevin Cassidy takes a chance on distraction. Makes no contact with the ball but gets enough of himself in the eyeline of Paul Hearty.\n\nThe Armagh goalkeeper loses it in the air, spills it in behind himself and into the net.\n\nThe chains of bondage are released. Donegal have finally beaten Armagh. But in an Ulster quarter-final, they've done it in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nIt would be Kernan's last Ulster Championship match in charge. After four Ulster titles and an All-Ireland, the final bell was rung by Collie Devlin in a qualifier attended by just 500 Derry fans in Clones.\n\nArmagh's story has been written.\n\nBut why did that Donegal team not find a way to win just once?\n\n________________________________________\n\nIT was as if gravity had abandoned Raymond Sweeney's lower lip. He's standing on the 13-metre line at Hill 16 open-mouthed, just staring at referee Michael Monahan, whose whistle never leaves his lips.\n\nIt was the only red card he ever got in a Donegal jersey and it came three minutes into the 2003 All-Ireland semi-final of which they had some small measure of control.\n\nChristy Toye's goal just before half-time helped them lead by 1-5 to 0-4.\n\nThe lead is still four when Paul McGonigle gives the ball away and Donegal are caught scrambling. Oisin McConville turns into Sweeney, puts the head down and takes the space.\n\n\"When I seen him reaching for a card, I thought 'whaattt the f*** are ye doing?' and next thing he was away with the yellow and obviously I was booked before,\" Sweeney recalls.\n\nThere are two versions of the truth from that day.\n\nDonegal would look at those first 38 minutes and see how Sweeney and a more commanding Tony Blake were gobbling up the aerial ball, and that Armagh were having serious trouble getting scores.\n\nThey still led after 55 minutes. Niall McCreadie had kept Stevie McDonnell on the tightest of leashes along the ground but with Sweeney gone, Armagh preyed on the height differential.\n\nThe long ball finally paid off. McDonnell was goalside and grabbed it over McCreadie's head, turned and finished low past Blake.\n\nFor their own contribution, the reigning All-Ireland champions ended up kicking 21 wides. How much of that was poor shooting and how much of it was being unable to get inside and shoot from where they wanted to shoot from.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in the tunnel after the game, Aidan O'Rourke summed up where Armagh felt they were at that day.\n\n\"At half-time we didn't need to be told. When you're playing shite, you're playing shite and everybody knows you're playing shite.\"\n\nWith 90 seconds to go of the three added minutes, Donegal are still level with Armagh.\n\nRaymond's brother Adrian, their captain, lodged a free that made it 1-9 apiece right on the 70th minute.\n\nBut the rub goes Armagh's way.\n\nJohn McEntee is lucky to stay on after lifting his elbow to Barry Monaghan, and luckier still that the referee booked him at the time, saving him a sweat over the All-Ireland final with Tyrone.\n\n\"I got a lot of abusive letters [about Armagh's physicality] after the Donegal game but, quite honestly, I couldn't see where the grounds for complaint lay. Believe me, plenty of our lads were pretty sore after that game but somehow Donegal were portrayed as being on the side of the angels,\" Joe Kernan said in his autobiography, Without A Shadow Of A Doubt.\n\nThere are 90 seconds left when the ball breaks beautifully into Philip Loughran's path. Point. With the last kick, a penalty from which Oisin McConville buries some demons of the 2002 final.\n\nWhat if Sweeney stays on that afternoon?\n\n\"It was moreso the disappointment of letting down my team, the guilt of that,\" he says.\n\n\"It's not that I looked at the referee and thought he had done wrong, it was just moreso I looked at the team and thought 'aw Jesus, what have I done to the f***ing team here?' That's the long and short of it.\n\n\"It was walking off knowing I can't contribute to what we're trying to do here. You don't get to too many All-Ireland semi-finals and being sent off in one like that, obviously it wasn't nice.\n\n\"I don't really carry any chips on my shoulder, hopefully. It's just one of those things that is. I always looked at it as a person I was very fortunate to play for my county.\n\n\"I would have loved a couple of Ulster titles surely but I don't look back and say it's eating me up or anything like that.\"\n\nHe damaged ligaments in his knee in the first round against Fermanagh and was taking injections to get through games.\n\nThat semi-final holds a different frustration for him. There are other games his mind goes to first.\n\nBut we'll start at the end, 2007, and finally get one over on them.\n\nFairly or otherwise, that Donegal team has carried a reputation of being, as Logan Roy might have put it, not serious people.\n\nNobody would touch the manager's job after a couple of high-profile incidents during the 2002 campaign under Mickey Moran, leaving Brian McEniff to step back in when he couldn't get anyone else by Christmas.\n\nBut Donegal were easy to disrespect too. They were far from the only team that enjoyed themselves.\n\nFor Devenney, who lost four Ulster finals, the partying culture wasn't the primary reason they fell short.\n\n\"I know where you're coming from on that because that would be my view too if I was outside the county and I didn't really know the boys.\n\n\"But those stories only come out when you lose. You can do whatever the hell you want if you win.\n\n\"I'll give you an example. I remember a session after we won the league final in 2007.\n\n\"There was a wee shop next door and for some reason, some eejits brought in stuff from the shop, bread and shit. It was stupid. But this stuff got scattered in your man's bar.\n\n\"Everyone was going mad, there was food everywhere, the place was f***ing wrecked, a serious state. There wasn't a word about. Not a f***ing word, because we had won.\"\n\nThat was a month before they ended the Armagh hex.\n\nThe idea that they were unserious stretched right out into the 2010 hammering in Crossmaglen, a day when Colm McFadden was picked up by the TV cameras smiling on the bench having been taken off.\n\nThat was unfair too on McFadden, who just happened to be making a joke at his own expense having been asked to stay around after the game for a presentation marking his 100th appearance.\n\nHe copped a lot of flak afterwards and considered quitting that winter, as others did.\n\nDonegal were an easy target for ridicule. They made themselves so at times, but not always.\n\nDevenney puts it down to a multitude of factors. Not excuses, but what he thinks are reasons why they could get so close to Armagh but never beat them.\n\nFor him, a lot of it goes back to that first Ulster final.\n\nMickey Moran and John Morrison had studied Armagh and came up with a gameplan that involved moving the ball as fast as they could into the spaces Kernan's men wanted to protect.\n\nMcEntee's early goal rocked them but Donegal took it down the stretch, undermined by their 14 wides.\n\n\"After the goal, we played the better football. We were in there fighting, but the forwards, myself included, didn't take enough chances.\n\n\"That was one of the few times I left thinking we could have beat them today.\"\n\nHe talks of working off a \"very low tactical base\" in other years, and how that just wouldn't fly against an Armagh side that obsessed over the details, right down to image consultant Billy Dixon's influence on their tight-fitting jerseys.\n\n\"With Armagh, it was semi-tactical and semi-rhythm for them. A lot of people called them rigid or robotic but in a tight championship game, that's gonna win.\n\n\"If you went three or four up, they played the same way as they were three or four down. With us, you were never sure from each ten minutes to the next. It could be good, it could be bad.\"\n\nIn his book, Winning, Rory Kavanagh recalls the 2006 final in his debut decider and going up against Andy Mallon.\n\n\"Against Down I had space. Against Derry, I had the freedom of the pitch...Andy Mallon was a whole different proposition. I had never met a marker as tight,\" he said, adding that Armagh were \"cynical, aggressive, sickeningly assured right to the very end.\" Raymond Sweeney puts the same words another way.\n\n\"There were times we went out and from a team perspective, sometimes it nearly looked like it depended what part of the bed we got out of, what humour we were in.\"\n\n________________________________________\n\nJOE Kernan once said that the 2004 Ulster final win as the single best performance of his entire reign.\n\nDonegal got torn apart, weeks after they'd been brilliant themselves in dumping All-Ireland champions Tyrone out.\n\nArmagh became everyone's favourites to win a second All-Ireland that day.\n\nThen along came Fermanagh.\n\nHaving ended Donegal's year in the qualifiers, Tom Brewster's winner against Armagh was like an earthquake hitting Gaelic football.\n\nThings weren't always particularly jovial in Armagh-Donegal games but a lot of it was either side of the noughties.\n\nIn more recent times, the fallout from the league game in 2022 and the fractious 2014 All-Ireland quarter-final were spicy.\n\nBack in November 1997, Armagh full-back Colm Hanratty suffered a bad leg break in Lurgan on a day when everyone went to war.\n\nIn Niall McCoy's fine book, Kings For A Day, now-GAA president and then-Armagh midfielder Jarlath Burns recalled how Brian McAlinden had made him march into the Donegal huddle after the incident.\n\n\"'McAlinden came on and said, \"Are you going to let those boys have a talk on our f***ing pitch?\" I said, \"What do you want me to do?\" \"Get into the middle of them; this is your pitch.\" 'I went into the middle on my own and the row started again. \"Get the f*** out of here!\" \"I'm going nowhere.\" Juvenile stuff - a fully qualified teacher at this nonsense.\n\n\"Cormac McGill, father of Fergal McGill from Croke Park, wrote in his match report that 'Jarlath Burns, who spends his summers in the Donegal Gaeltacht, walked into the middle of the Donegal team and promised them a watery grave.' I laughed out loud when someone sent that to me.'\"\n\nThe noughties games almost always contained red cards and yet never really spilled over either.\n\n\"Because you were looking at the same players all the time,\" says Raymond Sweeney, \"whether it was Marsden - who was a strong c***, so he was - or it was Ronan Clarke who was awkward, Steven McDonnell was a brilliant player, the McEntees and Paul McGrane...\n\n\"I remember meeting Paul McGrane away from it and they're all sound fellas. But when we were looking at each other, we were f***ing taking the heads off one another.\n\n\"That's the way it was, that was just part of the game.\"\n\nOn one weekend in 2005, ten Ulster players were sent off.\n\nFour of them were in the Donegal-Armagh replay, yet there was hardly a hand raised.\n\nKevin Cassidy had been sent off in the drawn game, as was Paddy McKeever late on.\n\nAnother chance missed in an absorbing 0-12 all draw.\n\nBefore the replay, Brian McEniff had his players in the hotel in Lisnaskea and said to them to keep their mouths shut and their hands down.\n\nIt didn't matter. It was still 15-a-side at half-time but even by then, both managers felt the need to intercept Maurice Deegan's exit from the pitch.\n\nIn the space of 13 second-half minutes, Eamon McGee, Brian Roper, Adrian Sweeney and Francie Bellew - hardest done by of all, in fairness - got their marching orders.\n\nArmagh scored a goal a minute after McGee's dismissal and another two minutes after Roper got the line.\n\nDevenney rifled home a late consolation and let a roar of sheer frustration and anger out of him that looked out of kilter for a goal that cut a ten-point deficit to seven.\n\n\"I've pushed it all down. The one we drew, I would say in the first game I was one of the few players didn't play well, and then the replay I was one of the only players that did play.\n\n\"I remember being so f***ing angry with myself because I hit 1-5 and all I could think was if I'd done that in the first game, we'd have won it.\"\n\nRaymond Sweeney was sat at home that day watching on TV. He'd struggled to shake a chest infection in the lead-up to the drawn game.\n\n\"We went back to Rossnowlagh to do a recovery session and I knew, I thought 'aw I'm f***ed here'. There was green phlegm coming out of me.\n\n\"I remember watching in the house, Eddie [Adrian] was sent off and the red fella...Francie, they'd have been battering the shite out of each other.\n\n\"Thanks for that, I didn't really think of that one! '02, '03, 04, '05, '06...\" he rhymes off.\n\nToo many to remember, evidence were it needed of the mental scarring left on that Donegal team by Armagh.\n\nIt would have been different if these were all hammering matches.\n\n2006 hardly gets a mention anywhere yet only a point-blank Hearty save from Stephen McDermott in the 71st minute preserved Armagh's winning three-point lead.\n\nYet it is perhaps a throwaway line about that game from Oisin McConville in his book that is both the sharpest barb and the most revealing insight.\n\n\"In the end, we did win another Ulster but by then it wasn't a real Ulster if we didn't beat Tyrone.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I've been talking to Co. Administrator, Noreen Doherty, and she tells me that there is a huge demand for tickets. There is a whole new set of supporters coming on board thanks to the success that has come in such a short time under Jim McGuinness.\n\nIt could well be the biggest crowd at an Ulster final in Clones for some time. Armagh traditionally carry a very big support as well but it seems as if we could well match them this weekend, which is great news.\n\nOn a more serious note we will go into the game as slight favourites, probably because of the couple of encounters we have had with them over the last few months. But some of those games had a bit of shadow boxing about. However, I still think we have too much for them\n\nI don't know what's the story about Eobhan Ban Gallagher, but apart from the Killybegs man we are likely to be playing with a full deck.\n\nHopefully the 'keeper, Shaun Patton, will be ready to go again. Gavin Mulreany did very well when thrown in against Tyrone but Patton has an extra dimension to his game and he can cause the opposition to have sleepless nights.\n\nOverall, we have had a fairly settled side since the start of the championship. The new midfield has settled in well with the Cloughaneely man, Jason McGee coming to the fore and he is a big addition. He is forming a great partnership with Michael Langan, another big man.\n\nThe full-back Brendan McCole is back once more and the half-back line of Ryan McHugh, Caolan McGonagle and Peadar Mogan are as good as you will find anywhere in the country.\n\nHopefully, the captain, Patrick McBrearty, is fully fit and ready for action. And of course our own Jamie Brennan here in Bundoran will be making his 100th appearance for Donegal, a pretty good milestone.\n\nWe all know what Armagh will bring to the table. They will be physical and fairly defensive. Their best player is Rian O'Neill but there is a lot of individuality about him. He plays for himself but he is strong and can take a score.\n\nI would rate his brother, Oisin, quite highly but for some reason they don't seem to start him.\n\nI'm sure Jim will have legislated for all outcomes and I wish him and the team well on Sunday.\n\nMy advice to people travelling is to get there early, get fed and watered and then make plenty of noise in supporting Donegal. The weather forecast at the moment is good up to Saturday but it could change on Sunday.\n\nAs regards memories of games against Armagh, there are some good and bad ones. We would have had some tough games against them in the early 1980s and some that we didn't fare well in. In 1982 they kicked a point from a sideline to defeat us in Ballybofey.\n\nThe following year Down and Armagh met in the Division 1 League final while ourselves and Fermanagh played in Ballyshannon to see which of us would end up in Division 4.\n\nThen a few weeks later Fermanagh beat Down in the Ulster championship in Irvinestown and we beat Armagh in Ballybofey and went on to win the Ulster tit.e\n\n1984 was the year of the hamstrings in Donegal. We lost Paul McGettigan and a week before the championship we had a game with Sligo and we lost Martin McHugh and Mickey Lafferty that evening. Then in the game in the Athletic Grounds Seamus Bonar missed a penalty and we had Tommy McDermott sent off. I had taken Gerry Curran with me on the morning for cover and he almost won the game for us. But it was a day that anything that could go wrong went wrong.\n\nWe had a better day in 1990 in the Ulster final when they had the big Grimleys, one at centre-half and one at midfield. I had taken Martin Griffin and Mickey Lafferty back to the panel to train with those two in mind but we didn't need them on the day.\n\nBut back to this Sunday, again I urge supporters to get there early. There is a great buzz about at the minute with a whole new bunch of support. I would urge them to get behind their own team and not indulge in any booing of the opposition.\n\nI want to wish Mickey McCann and the hurlers all the best on Saturday in the Nickey Rackard Cup when they travel to Roscommon. A win there would leave them looking at a final.\n\nCongratulations to Barry Ward and his minors on a great win over Monaghan in Ballyshannon last week and they can now look forward to an Ulster semi-final.\n\nCongratulations also to Kilcar on winning the Gaeltacht competition on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "donegallive.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "donegallive.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Time has come for Armagh to deliver says Paddy Burns", "body": "Armagh hope for second time lucky against Donegal in Ulster Senior Championship final\n\nPADDY Burns puts it very matter-of-factly: \"If not now, then when?\" replies the Armagh defender when he is asked if the Orchard County's time will come on Sunday.\n\nBurns missed last year's well-documented Ulster final near miss through injury but he was back in the team for the equally well-documented penalty shootout loss to Monaghan. He's been through the near misses and heard all the hard luck stories.\n\n\"You always assume that it's your time\" says Burns.\n\n\"Some of us are getting that bit older: I'm 31, some of the key players like Rory Grugan is 32-ish, (Aidan) Forker is around that and 'Soupy' (Stefan) Campbell...\n\n\"We have definitely knocked on the door a fair few times and we are getting to the point where it is time we did something but all we can do is our best on the day.\n\n\"We have come up against some great teams and some great performances over the last four or five years that have put us out by the odd point or penalties here and there.\n\n\"We will just go out and give it our all to ensure this is our time. On the day we will just see what happens but we are definitely hopeful that we can do it.\"\n\nDonegal have been regular Ulster Championship winners since Armagh last got their hands on the Anglo-Celt in 2008. Sunday's is their 11th final in 14 seasons but they haven't won an Ulster title since 2019 and lost deciders in 2020 and 2022. There'll be no lack of hunger in the Donegal ranks says Burns.\n\n\"It's a difficult animal we are coming up against,\" he adds.\n\n\"The game isn't going to go your way all the time so you have to be able to respond whenever they have their purple patch.\n\n\"No team is going to go 70-minutes without having a good spell, so you just have go in expecting that knowing that you have to try and limit how effective it is when they have it and respond whenever that is over and it's our time to go.\"\n\nWhat can supporters expect on Sunday? Both counties have scoring forwards and can play front-foot attacking football but Armagh struggled with Down's defensive system and Donegal could adopt similar tactics.\n\nBurns says the days of the \"straight shoot-out\" are long gone.\n\n\"I don't even think it is really relevant, but if they are willing to agree to it, we will do a shoot-out for the craic,\" he added.\n\n\"If you look at our team, we have some of the best forwards around, I think. I would be willing to say, pound for pound we have some of the best forwards in the country.\"\n\nNone of Armagh's starting front six scored from open play against Down but Burns is confident there's better to come on Sunday.\n\n\"Some of them had a bad weekend, that happens, but we still found a way to win,\" he said.\n\n\"Donegal are the same, they have (Oisin) Gallen, (Ciaran) Thompson, (Paddy) McBrearty... They have plenty of good forwards\n\n\"I don't want to say who would win in a great shoot-out, but I would say people would enjoy watching it.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Donegal", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "County Donegal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "County Donegal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armagh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Armagh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Armagh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Senior_Football_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ulster Senior Football Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ulster"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ulster"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Monaghan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County Monaghan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anglo-Celt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Anglo-Celt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Counties of Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_for_pound", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound for pound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.irishnews.com/resizer/v2/WS6RYBU27NPLJP7F2TWJRXY2DM.jpg?smart=true&auth=ac34958d31a2e215cf83d762f9c3cddf79292bf54969b6ccc90490205e329082&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552089", "eventUri": "eng-9552089", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Having lost the Ulster final to Tyrone after a replay the previous year, Brian McEniff had replaced Tom Conaghan as manager and by July's third Sunday, they were back in Clones for another Ulster final - this time against Armagh.\n\nIt is 34 years ago now and it seems like a lifetime ago. Donegal defeated Cavan in the quarter-final and before just 5,000 supporters they had an easy win over Derry in Clones in the semi-final, a game which clashed with the Ireland v Egypt World Cup group game.\n\n\"Armagh were one of the big guns that time in Ulster,\" said Martin Shovlin, who had broken into the Donegal team when Tom Conaghan was in charge.\n\nIt was the time of knock-out championship football and one slip and you were gone.\n\n\"It's interesting if it was today, what the story would be. Boys playing 140 or 150 games. That's what it's going to now. But that time once you were bate, it was goodbye. It was a long summer then.\"\n\nBut it proved to be a successful summer in 1990 with Donegal back in the final and Martin Shovlin remembers the day and that summer fondly.\n\n\"I remember the day. I think it rained before the game. As far as I can remember it was slippy, but it cleared up. It was a humid kind of day.\n\n\"We travelled up in the morning. There was a golf club out the road from Clones. You would have the talk out there and the tea or soup. And then drive into the game. There were no overnights that time.\n\n\"We would meet up in Donegal Town. There would be the usual couple of car loads from Glen, Kilcar, Killybegs and myself.\"\n\nThe game itself proved to be a very close affair with Donegal always ahead, although Armagh came back to level on six occasions before Donegal edged the contest 0-15 to 0-14.\n\n\"Armagh were wile big, they were very physical. You look at the two Grimleys, they were monsters of men. Niall Smyth in the middle of the field. Martin McQuillan was missing that day, he was injured and was a big loss to them. He played wing half-back. I think his son, Ross, is involved with the present team.\n\n\"Martin McQuillan was a great footballer. I knew he was injured that day and I think we were glad he was missing.\"\n\nShovlin remembers who he was marking on the day.\n\n\"He was the boy by the name of Ollie Reel, a curly haired boy. He was a freetaker.\n\n\"I was happy enough, he was taken off. At that time you seemed to have done alright if your man was taken off. It's different nowadays.\n\n\"But I remember then they took on a fella by the name of Shane Skelton. He was only on for 15 minutes but he kicked three points, three unreal points. Anywhere he kicked from, they went over the bar.\"\n\nWhen asked who was supposed to be marking Skelton, he replies: \"He came on for Reel so it must have been me,\" laughs Shovlin. \"I don't know why he didn't start, he was unreal.\n\n\"Ger Houlihan at full-forward was a good bit of stuff as well and Jim McConville,\" adds Shovlin who was surprised to hear that current GAA President Jarlath Burns and Colm Hanratty were unused subs on the day.\n\n\"We got stuck in and it was a great win to be honest. We were beaten the previous year after a replay (against Tyrone) and it was nice to get the first medal.\"\n\nDonegal went on to play Meath in the All-Ireland semi-final in Croke Park. \"That game does stand out, my first championship game in Croke Park. I might have played one league game but that was all.\n\n\"We were with them until the last 15 minutes. There was an unfortunate goal. You don't forget them things too easy,\" said Shovlin, who said there was a great buzz that summer as it was his first Ulster medal and the first for a good number of the panel.\n\nAsked about playing under Brian McEniff, he says: \"Brian was fair, he gave you your chance and it was up to you to take it. He would give you a couple of chances in fairness to him. He wouldn't judge you on one day.\"\n\nIt was a good year in other ways for the county as Barry McGowan and Tony Boyle both made their championship debuts, as did John Ban Gallagher.\n\nAnd at the end of the year Martin Shovlin was selected by the Ulster GAA Writers' Association as the Player of the Year.\n\n\"It was nice. Anything like that was lovely at the time.\"\n\nNow on Sunday next the counties will meet again in Clones in an Ulster final and it's one that Shovlin is looking forward to.\n\n\"It will be interesting. It will depend what way Armagh sets up. We can imagine it will be defensive. He (Kieran McGeeney) will be ultra defensive this time. Look, he needs to win something shortly, he's there long enough now.\"\n\nBut he believes Jim McGuinness will have his plans made.\n\n\"That's the way Jim is, he wants to win silverware, that's what it's all about. The Ulster final is nothing to be sneezed at. Ulster medals, they are not easy got.\"\n\nAre Donegal as good as we're making out after Derry and Tyrone?\n\n\"They are improving all the time. They all seem to know their jobs and they all stick to it and they are getting it done and it's working for them.\n\n\"The thing I like about them, it was nearly in injury time when they got the leveller (against Tyrone) when McCole equalised. They kept going and didn't throw in the towel and fair play that's another good thing about them.\n\n\"They kept the cool and worked it until it came about. Their fitness, they are in great shape,\" said Shovlin, who said he would love to be involved in the modern game.\n\n\"There were some of our men who wouldn't be too fond of it,\" laughed Shovlin.",

Grainne McCoy ran the first four in our relay team and when she handed the baton over I ran as hard as I could until I saw Cahair O'Kane standing grinning on the Boucher Road ready to take over and do his bit (a much less impressive 4.2 miles).\n\nI was glad to get finished.\n\nAfterwards I headed back to my friend Marty's house in Derriaghy, had a shower, knocked about, ate half a pizza, went to get the bus into Belfast, stood waiting at the bus stop for half-an-hour, no bus arrived, walked back to the house, got into the car, made it to the Ormeau Road, drove round and round until we found a parking spot, walked to the Errigal, put two quid in the poker machine as I waited for Marty to get served at the packed bar, found a seat, drank the pint of Guinness.\n\nThen I got a phonecall.\n\n\"Quick, Sinead is running past the Errigal now,\" my wife explained.\n\nI hopped up and went out, weaved through the crowd and looked down the Ormeau Road. My sister-in-law Sinead was doing the full marathon so she had started long before me and was still running - with a sore knee and a sore hip and all - long, long after I was finished.\n\nOne of the thousands of absolute legends who really pushed themselves to the limit over 26 miles, she ran through the pain barrier to raise money for Cancer Focus in memory of her great friend Nicola who so sadly passed away long before her time a few years ago.\n\nSinead ran for over five and-a-half hours and there were others who finished long after her, but who cares how long it took? All that matters is getting out there and getting over that line.\n\nThe Armagh players will feel the same about Sunday's Ulster final. Win by 10 points, win by one, win ugly, get lucky... It doesn't matter, just get over the line.\n\nEver since Kieran McGeeney took over as manager people have been saying there is an Ulster Championship in Armagh. Year after year they have been tipped and, as we all know, year after year they have fallen short.\n\nWe used to marvel at Mayo's persistence as they strove for the Sam Maguire. Hordes of adoring fans followed them wherever they went and they watched them find new ways to lose. So close so often against Dublin and then they beat the Dubs in the 2021 semi-final and faced Tyrone in the final. It has to be their year, we thought.\n\nSam never went West.\n\nRegardless of what they've won or will win, the entertainment this Armagh side has given their fans should never be discounted but if they are going to win an Ulster title, Sunday surely has to be their time.\n\nStalwarts Rory Grugan, Stefan Campbell, Aidan Forker, Andrew Murnin, Ethan Rafferty, Paddy Burns, Mark Shields, James Morgan have been soldiering on throughout McGeeney's 10 seasons at the helm.\n\nTake Grugan, an All-Ireland minor winner in 2009, for an example. He has been at the coalface for his county for approaching 15 years now and he is playing as well as ever. Indeed, he scored a point in the League final against Donegal earlier this year which may have been the best of his long career.\n\nWhen he plays well, Armagh invariably play well but his story is Armagh's story - so near, and yet so far. There was the Qualifier against Mayo in Castlebar when he made a brilliant run but his shot hit the crossbar. Armagh lost by a point.\n\nThere was the Ulster final last year when his mark looked destined to be the winner but then the ball was caught by a gust of wind blown by some sorcerer in the Sperrins and dropped just short. Derry won on penalties.\n\nGrugan showed remarkable resilience last year to take a late free against Galway in Carrick-on-Shannon and get Armagh over the line in a game they could easily have lost.\n\nGiven all their close calls over the last decade, only the most hard-core Down or Tyrone supporter could begrudge Armagh an Ulster title.\n\nThey've earned one, they deserve one...\n\n\"Cry me a river,\" say Donegal who will be every bit as hungry on Sunday.\n\nThe Tir Chonaill men have gone five years without an Ulster title and, like Armagh, they've snatched defeat out of the jaws of victory.\n\nThere was the Ulster final against Cavan in 2020 when they out-scored the Breffnimen 7-1 at one stage and then went to sleep and lost. Then Derry a couple of years ago when they all seemed to be waiting on someone else - usually Michael Murphy - to win the title for them.\n\nWhat has changed? Jim McGuinness has returned and the man has the Midas touch. He doesn't reinvent the wheel but he has the instinct and the confidence to do the right thing at the right time. Is that genius?\n\nWould another manager have been brave and ruthless enough to take Paddy McBrearty - the captain and so often the star man - off at half-time in the semi-final? No, most would leave him on hoping he would click but McGuinness had seen enough and he acted decisively.\n\nAnd there was more. McBrearty accepted McGuinness's decision. It actually got better out of him. There was no huffing, no spitting out the dummy. He went back on for extra-time and scored a brilliant point.\n\nMcGuinness puts the wind up Armagh fans. They might curse their luck and ask: \"Why did he have to come back now, when we're so close?\"\n\nBut he can't go out on the field and if you go through the personnel, there's nothing between the teams on Sunday.\n\nBelief will win the day and getting over the line is all that counts...", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"}, "authors": [],

Christmas Day is a time of eat-drink-and-be-merry for most of us.\n\nBut not Paddy Burns.\n\nThe Armagh defender is a driven man who prided himself on giving more than anyone else and that meant the ultimate sacrifice - training on Christmas Day.\n\n\"One year I went out running and I pulled a hamstring,\" he says.\n\n\"I didn't have the wherewithal that I couldn't text the physio on Christmas Day. I was straight onto him: 'I've pulled me hamstring here, can you do anything for me?' The physio came back: 'It's Christmas Day Paddy, can you leave me alone...'\"\n\nHe laughs as he thinks of how he used to be.\n\nThings changed when Santa started calling at the Burns house in Burren. Paddy and his wife have their nine-month old daughter Clodagh to focus on now and last Christmas was the first one for a long while that he stayed put.\n\n\"I thought: 'I'm with my family, I'm enjoying it',\" he says and, guess what, a little less intensity is working out for him.\n\nThis season he stayed injury-free and started every game - all eight in the League as Armagh romped to promotion back to Division One and the Championship wins over Fermanagh and Down - at corner-back.\n\n\"I was thinking about that a few weeks ago. I've always taken it very seriously - I put a lot of time into training and preparing - as does every county player - but I think this year an element of that has actually come away a little bit.\n\n\"The baby in particular coming into the mix has taken the heat off the whole thing for me. I still plan the same way, I train hard and prepare well but there's that tipping of perspective that has made the whole thing a bit more easier for me.\n\n\"I'm still gutted when we lose, I'm still delighted when we win... I still have the ups and downs but you go home and there's something more important there to focus on. I've a great wife who would always have been good at getting me out of those dour moods when we lost but now I don't have a choice - I can't go home and be in bad form with a wee girl there who doesn't understand why, so I just have to park it.\"\n\nYOU don't have to dig down too deep to understand why he is so driven. He plays Division One football at club level with Burren these days but it was far from the top flight he was reared. His journey to Sunday's Ulster final began 15 years ago when he was thrown into senior football for his native Forkhill in Armagh's junior league at the age of 16. With the added impetus of Armagh team-mates Jemar Hall and then Stephen Sheridan, the club worked its way up to the top flight.\n\n\"I owe a huge debt to Forkhill,\" he says.\n\n\"For all they did bringing me up and coaching me - I had some great coaches over the years. I started at junior - Jemar and I played, probably illegally, at 16 and we went up through the leagues to senior and we stayed up at senior for a year or two.\n\n\"We had a great journey and that put us on the radar in terms of getting called up for Armagh. It's not the normal way but there probably aren't as many counties who have as many players from intermediate and junior clubs as Armagh have done - we've had Forkhill players, Shane O'Neill's (the Mackin brothers and Greg McCabe), Carrickcruppen (Blaine Hughes), Clonmore... We've had a lot of players from down the leagues and I don't know whether that does anything in terms of hunger or attitude but I like to think that fellas from that level, when they get their chance, they have a bit more of a bit between their teeth because they know they're doing well to be there and they want to push on and prove to themselves that they can be (county players).\"\n\nMOVING on to the present day, he blushes a little when his own goal against Down is brought up. In all fairness, he couldn't have done anything about it - Ceilum Doherty's shot was saved by Blaine Hughes and the rebound hit Burns who was doing his best to get back and help out.\n\nJust one of those things....\n\n\"Yeah, it was my first Championship goal, not a great one,\" he says with a smile\n\n\"But we responded well to that, I think probably that is something we have done better this year, responding to setbacks.\n\n\"Even down in Cork we were ahead and reasonably comfortable, we gave a goal away and we came back and gave another goal away and we came back again to draw.\n\n\"That was a difficult night in Pairc Ui Chaoimh. We had Donegal in the League final, granted we didn't win the game, we didn't play well but we found a spell where we went at it and got level actually, so we have definitely got better at responding to setbacks and we can turn up the heat when that happens.\n\n\"You can chat to psychologists and you can read into all that type of thing but it really is about having a mental practice around what do you do when something goes wrong. A buzz word to yourself: 'Next ball'.\n\n\"Do you look at something in the stand as a refocus to you? It is all about not dwelling on it when things happen, you can't ignore it and say: 'I didn't just knee the ball into my own net...' But at the same time, it's done and you just have to practice responding to that.\n\n\"In training you are going to make mistakes too and the more mistakes you make, in a way, the better you become at being able to move on pretty quickly, because something is happening again and you have to be ready for the next play.\n\n\"It is like anything, the free-taker has their own skills, what they do, their little techniques, some of them speak to themselves and you see what I call the silly run-ups and that kind of thing.\n\n\"For them, that's all muscle memory, exactly on what you are doing in that moment and it is the same thing when you respond to a mistake, I think.\"\n\nLAST year was Armagh's first Ulster final since 2008 and Burns missed out with injury. His uncle Jarlath captained the Orchard county to success in 1999, ending a 17-year wait for the Anglo-Celt and Paddy and cousin Jarly Og would dearly love to be part of ending the current 16-year drought.\n\n\"I was definitely hopeful (Armagh would get to another final),\" he says.\n\n\"It was disappointing to miss it last year. I still got a few big games in after it in the All-Ireland series - I got a game in Croke Park (against Monaghan), I got the game against Galway in Carrick-on-Shannon... I got a few good games but it was a tough year and I feel, with the work I've put in over the years, it's good to get the pay-off of getting a chance in one of these big days.\n\n\"I feel like I've earned it to an extent in terms of injury rehab and all that so it's nice to get a chance.\"\n\nHe missed out last year but he feels that the experience of being to an Ulster final will benefit his team-mates who played in the 2023 nerve-jangler against Derry.\n\n\"The bus journey to Clones, the Gardai getting the traffic out of the way, the crowds... Any experience of that you get sets you up well for the next year,\" he says.\n\n\"But the Donegal fellas haven't been away for too long. They have plenty of experience of it themselves so we're both probably even at this stage.\"\n\nThere is experience there and also bench strength and it was the Armagh subs who pushed Kieran McGeeney's team over the line against Down at the semi-final stage. Oisin O'Neill, Aidan Nugent and Jason Duffy came on and got the last three scores as the Orchard county turned a two-point deficit into a one-point win.\n\n\"I am not superstitious person but I am going to touch a bit of wood, I think that (bit of luck) is long overdue,\" says Burns.\n\n\"We have been unfortunate over the years with injuries to key players at bad times, so I think availability is great.\n\n\"Fellas put in a heck of a pre-season, trained really hard and got the miles in the legs and the science would say there is a big link about how much pre-season you get done versus how available you stay in the season and that seems to be paying off for us and it is leading to squad competition.\n\n\"There are fellas not making the 26 or 30 who are fantastic players in our squad and really driving the whole thing on with 15 v 15 in training, or if someone has a niggle and has to step out, you are not worried about who is stepping in and it is keeping training at such a high level.\n\n\"I would say this is the best period we have had of having everyone fit and long may it continue.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"},

He has gone to where his team have needed him.\n\nSome time in midfield, a spell on the edge of the square and occasionally he can be found in the half-forward line. He has been Armagh's most effective target man, best fielder of the ball and most reliable free-taker.\n\nIn that way, there's a neat symmetry to the fact that O'Neill came of age as an Armagh player in Michael Murphy's final county appearance. For years, the Donegal talisman would go where his team's need was the greatest. So much so that one of the constant conversations in the county was where he should play.\n\nNobody knew it at the time but Donegal's meek Championship exit to Armagh in Clones two summers ago not only brought Declan Bonner's tenure to an end but it was also when Murphy called time on his own glittering career. It was also the afternoon that O'Neill announced himself to the wider world.\n\nThe gifted Crossmaglen star had terrorised a Dublin defence earlier in the year in an Allianz League encounter at Croke Park, but this was the white heat of Clones in high summer and O'Neill made the stage his own, scoring 1-7 but his most telling contribution came straight from throw-in.\n\nAfter grabbing the ball that referee Brendan Cawley had just thrown up, O'Neill arrowed a pinpoint pass into Rory Grugan who blasted the ball into the net. Less than 10 seconds had elapsed. It was recorded as the second fastest goal in Championship history and O'Neill had been the architect with his vision and accuracy of passing.\n\nLater that summer, on a tense afternoon in Croke Park, O'Neill nailed a monstrous free to take Armagh's simmering encounter with Galway into extra-time. Eventually, the Tribesmen would prevail on penalties - just one of those close calls that are beginning to characterise Kieran McGeeney's Orchard County reign.\n\nGiven his performance in Clones and Croke Park, there was some anger in Armagh that O'Neill was snubbed for an All-Star at the end of his breakthrough season of 2022. But the player himself was pragmatic about that, even modestly suggesting on BBC's GAA Social podcast, which his uncle Oisin McConville presents alongside Thomas Niblock, that he probably didn't do enough to earn the accolade.\n\nStill, there was no doubt that he ended that year as one of the hottest young properties in Gaelic football. Last year, when Armagh's season hinged on two penalty shoot-out defeats - in the Ulster final and All-Ireland quarter-final, O'Neill found it a challenge to impose himself, not helped by injury problems at the start of the year and a controversial red card against Tyrone in the Sam Maguire group stages.\n\nFor him to truly be considered in the same bracket as some of the top players in the game, he needs to find a way of getting more consistency into his game.\n\nBut there have been signs so far this season that that might be happening. O'Neill has been mostly stationed in midfield and both the player and Armagh are benefitting. He was his team's most effective and influential player in their opening two Ulster SFC games - against Fermanagh and Down.\n\nIn the claustrophobic surrounds of Ulster football, we will never see the best of O'Neill at full-forward. It can simply be too congested on the edge of the square. As McGeeney and his management team have realised, it is better to have him further out the field, where his fielding ability and fans range of passing come to the fore. And he can nail those long-range points and frees, when required.\n\nIt is why successive Donegal managers had to redeploy Murphy into the centre of the field, just so he could get on the ball. And just like Murphy, O'Neill has that calming presence when he is in possession and never looks rushed or panicked. But his physical tools and footballing prowess mean that he is also seen as the solution to any problems that Armagh have on the field. Just as Murphy was in Donegal.\n\nAndrew Murnin's performance as inside-forward against Down - his ball-winning ability and patience craved out the winning score for Jason Duffy - means that Armagh can now utilise O'Neill out the field, without feeling they are losing something in front of the opposition goal.\n\nO'Neill's pedigree was never in doubt, especially around Crossmaglen. Son of Gareth, who played for both Armagh and Louth, and nephew to McConville, who scored the goal that propelled the Orchard County to their first All-Ireland, Rian - along with his brother Ois\u00edn - was marked out from an early age.\n\nHe helped his club collect their 47th county title last autumn, but it has been in the orange of Armagh where most expectation has been placed on O'Neill. And if the Orchard\n\nCounty are finally going to fulfil their potential under McGeeney, in his 10th season in charge, the feeling is that a lot rests O'Neill.\n\nFrom Murnin to Aidan Forker to Jarly \u00d3g Burns, there is plenty of talented players sprinkled around this Armagh side. But for them to make the break-through, they need someone capable of conjuring moments of magic - just as O'Neill has done in the past, from the equalising free he kicked against Galway in Croke Park two years ago to the audacious point he scored against Monaghan in last year's All-Ireland quarter-final, he possesses that rare ability to do something few other players can do.\n\nNo doubt Jim McGuinness will have a plan to curb his effectiveness in Clones this Sunday, whether it means Jason McGee sticks to him or Caolan McGonagle is asked to follow him around the field. But O'Neill has been excellent in the opening two games, without providing one of those moments that makes everyone stand up and take notice.\n\nBut he is still capable of them. No grander stage than Clones this coming Sunday to remind everyone of that", "source": {"uri": "extra.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Extra.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

One of us will throw it over our own bars at the end if we have to,\" jokes Burns.\n\n\"We were very close in normal time last year and then again in extra-time. But we probably should have won it in normal time against what everybody knows now is a really good Derry team.\n\n\"It's not often you get another opportunity so soon to give yourself a chance to undo it. So that's definitely a big thought for us: 'Let's go out and try to give ourselves the best shot at doing what we should have done last year'.\"\n\nUnfortunately for McGeeney, the Orchard boss seems to take a lot of the blame for these close defeats, and that's something that the players want to correct.\n\nBurns has such great admiration for their leader, not least because he could never imagine putting himself through the toil of inter-county management.\n\n\"I think you always want to go out and win something for him because we put in a lot of time but... me and Paddy McBrearty were talking there and I asked him if he would ever consider going into county management, and the two of us both agreed 'absolutely not,\" he explains.\n\n\"It's such a difficult job. It takes so much time, so much effort, and I think for the time he has put into us, the stuff he gives us, how well he looks after us, the least we can do is try to give him an Ulster title, and we will be doing our best to do that.\n\n\"We turn up, we train, get our rehab done, get our skills done, sit around and have food after, maybe a bit of physio, and we go home.\n\n\"Then you can switch off a bit the next day, until about five or six o'clock. Whereas it feels like they [managers] just have a constant barrage of things to do, questions to answer, logistics to sort out, meetings.\n\n\"They will have their meetings ahead of training, so they know what they're trying to do that night and who they're looking at, what they want to see.\n\n\"It seems like they're in constant conversation, constantly analysing, constantly coming to us with information. I don't know where they get the hours from, to be honest. It's not something that I would want to do.\"\n\nOne new face in the Armagh backroom team is Derry native Conleith Gilligan, and the freshness he has brought with him has given the whole team a lift.\n\n\"He brings a bit of craic,\" says Burns. \"He's a funny fella, Conleith, and he has got a good way about him.\n\n\"He's a very skilful fella, he still gets involved in training in the warm-ups and stuff, and he kicks some outrageous scores. Then he's straight over throwing elbows in and ribbing the fellas.\n\n\"That's probably one of the things he brings, away from the tactical nuances. Everyone knows his credentials and what he's good at. He brings great energy, which is something that Kieran Donaghy brought when he joined and still brings now.\n\n\"Conleith is a new voice now, he's very positive, he brings a great buzz and you feel as though he wants to do the drills with you.\n\n\"That gives everyone else the energy to train hard, push on and bring something different.\"", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "EFL Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_McBrearty", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick McBrearty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armagh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Armagh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Armagh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_McGeeney", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kieran McGeeney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derry", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Derry"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derry"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Senior_Football_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ulster Senior Football Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anglo-Celt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Anglo-Celt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donegal_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donegal GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-county", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inter-county"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Counties of Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conleith_Gilligan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conleith Gilligan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Donaghy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Donaghy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physical therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ulster"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ulster"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/extra/assets/img/dummy-social.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552089", "eventUri": "eng-9552089", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

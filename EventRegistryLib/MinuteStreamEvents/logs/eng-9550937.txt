With success on defense, attention shifts to the offense led by Watson and a returning Chubb. Watson's history of controversies and injuries raises questions, but the team remains hopeful.\n\nCleveland Browns' general manager Andrew Berry expressed his hopeful expectations for his quarterback, Deshaun Watson, in the upcoming 2024 season on the The Pat McAfee Show:\n\nWe do expect to hit the ground running on that side of the ball, and I know he is very excited about returning to the playing field and getting over this injury. We do have high expectations for him and the offense this season.\n\nThe Browns 2023 defense played with an aggression that helped lead them to the playoffs. They led the NFL in total defense and passing defense and they were also tremendous at keeping teams short of the chains, allowing the fewest rushing and passing first downs in the league.\n\nThe success on the back of the defense means all eyes will fall on the offense led by Watson, which has under-performed since his arrival, excluding running back Nick Chubb. The All-Pro back is returning after a season-ending knee injury in 2023, so the identity of this offense is in doubt.\n\nRelated NFL MVP Race 2024-25: Favorites & Odds to Win NFL MVP Patrick Mahomes leads the 2024-25 NFL MVP race while reigning winner Lamar Jackson barely cracks the top five. Watson And The Offense Must Deliver This Season The QB with a fully guaranteed contract has yet to live up to expectations.\n\nDespite trading for Watson and signing him to a fully guaranteed five-year, $230M contract, the Browns are still waiting for results from a player they anticipated would transform their passing game. Berry sounds unfazed about the quarterback coming off a season-ending shoulder injury:\n\nObviously, he's been rehabbing the shoulder injury, but he is well on his way there and in a really strong spot. I think he's a lot more comfortable within the organization. You know, we have a core group of guys on offense that have now played together for a number of years.\n\nThe Browns' receiving corps will be trial and error in training camp. Returning players like veteran Amari Cooper and Elijah Moore are expected to have better years with Watson returning. They also acquired former Denver Broncos wideout Jerry Jeudy via trade, giving away nothing but 2024 fifth and sixth-round selections to get the former first-round pick.\n\nThe team also drafted Louisville rookie Jamari Thrash in the fifth round, and Cedric Tillman and David Bell are also expected to compete for snaps. The team's best receiving weapon in 2023 was veteran tight end David Njoku, who led the team with 81 receptions.\n\nGIVEMESPORT KEY STAT: Deshaun Watson's 2.6 interception rate since arriving in Cleveland is the 12th-worst during that span from 2022-2023. Only one of the 11 players with a worse INT rate, Buffalo's Josh Allen, is set to be a Week 1 starter in 2024, however.\n\nWatson enters his third season with the Browns, but has yet to play a full slate. He sat out the 2021 season due to numerous off-field controversies, including sexual misconduct and sexual assault accusations as well as a contact holdout.\n\nHe was suspended the following season as fallout from the previous year, and only played six games in 2022. His 2023 season was unimpressive to start, but he shut down his campaign due to injury just when he was starting to show flashes of success. Berry recognizes the need for patience in this situation:\n\nI don't think it's uncommon for some transition or acclimation -- that has to be in the realm of possibility. But we feel good about [Deshaun], like the trajectory we have seen, and do think he will have a big year.\n\nIf Watson can settle down and avoid more injury bugs, the team is hopeful he can return to the elite form he showed on the field with the Houston Texans as a youngster.\n\nWatson's Pro Bowl Season Stats\n\nYear\n\nPassing Yards\n\nCompletion %\n\nW-L Record\n\nTD\n\n2018\n\n4,165\n\n68.3\n\n11-5\n\n26\n\n2019\n\n3,852\n\n67.3\n\n10-6\n\n26\n\n2020\n\n4,823\n\n70.2\n\n4-12\n\n33\n\nBerry sounds confident in Watson, but if he fails to progress the passing game, this organization that has finally found its footing may be on the verge of finding out that what they've created was built on a shaky foundation.\n\nSource: The Pat McAfee Show\n\nAll

In total, he's played in just 12 games for the Browns over the last two years due to a suspension stemming from his off-the-field turmoil, including allegations of sexual misconduct and sexual assault, along with a season-ending shoulder injury he endured last year. While the road has certainly been bumpy for Watson and the Browns, there are those within the front office who believe his best days are still in front of him.\n\nLast week, general manager Andrew Berry admitted that the team anticipated a transition period for Watson after acquiring him in a blockbuster trade with the Houston Texans in the spring of 2022.\n\n\"I don't think it's uncommon for some transition or acclimation -- that has to be in the realm of possibility,\" Berry told the Pat McAfee Show, via NFL.com. \"But we feel good about Deshaun, like the trajectory we have seen, and do think he will have a big year.\"\n\nWatson was limited to six games during his first season with the team due to his suspension and looked quite rusty when he ultimately got back on the field. The hope was that the 28-year-old would be able to hit the ground running in 2023, but a shoulder injury knocked him out for the year.

It's been defined by off-field issues, injuries and mostly subpar play on the field. If Watson doesn't meet expectations during his third season in Cleveland, the Browns could start moving in a different direction.\n\nIn a much-too-early 2025 mock draft, FOX Sports draft analyst Rob Rang has the Browns selecting Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe with the No. 18 overall pick.\n\n\"To earn a first-round NFL draft selection, Milroe will have to show significant improvement as a pocket passer, but he has a head coach in Kalen DeBoer who can develop his accuracy and anticipation and, of course, already boasts elite size and athleticism,\" Rang wrote. \"Milroe will be one of the most fascinating and closely scrutinized prospects in the country next season.\"\n\nMilroe's draft stock aside, it'd be an interesting pick for the Browns, who are linked to Watson through the 2026 season on a fully guaranteed contract. Selecting a quarterback in the first round would signal that Watson's time in Cleveland is at least limited.\n\nThat being said, next year's draft is a year away and a lot can happen between now and then.\n\nWatson has had a rough ride so far in Cleveland. And he's coming off season-ending shoulder surgery. However, the team has not wavered with their confidence in him. Browns general manager Andrew Berry expects his $230 million passer to have a big year.\n\n\"We feel very good about the transition. He is in a good spot mentally and physically,\" Berry said during an appearance on the Pat McAfee Show. \"Obviously, he's been rehabbing the shoulder injury, but he is well on his way there and in a really strong spot. I think he's a lot more comfortable within the organization. You know, we have a core group of guys on offense that have now played together for a number of years.\n\n\"We do expect to hit the ground running on that side of the ball, and I know he is very excited about returning to the playing field and getting over this injury. We do have high expectations for him and the offense this season.\"\n\nThe Browns made the playoffs last season but started five different quarterbacks. Cleveland is seemingly more prepared if Watson ends up missing time with injury issues.\n\nThe Browns signed former top pick Jameis Winston to backup Watson. The team also added Tyler Huntley, who has starting experience from his time with the Baltimore Ravens. They'll join second-year QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson on the depth chart.\n\nThe hope for the Browns is that the backup quarterback spot won't be as discussed as it was a year ago. And if Cleveland can get a full season out of Watson, it will give them a better read on the future of the quarterback position.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalen_DeBoer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kalen DeBoer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Huntley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Huntley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorian_Thompson-Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dorian Thompson-Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_McAfee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat McAfee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameis_Winston", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jameis Winston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1862809713-4-e1715163105679.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550937", "eventUri": "eng-9550937", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

In 2023, he went 5-1 as Cleveland's starter before suffering a season-ending shoulder injury in a Week 10 win over the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nAlthough Watson has only played in a total of 12 games since the end of the 2020 season - when he was the NFL's passing yards leader (4,823) - NFL Network's Rhett Lewis thinks the former Clemson star is capable of returning to form as one of the best signal-callers in the sport.\n\n\"I do think that Deshaun Watson can once again become one of the elite quarterbacks in this league,\" Lewis said in an interview with Spencer German on The Dawg Check podcast. \"There's too much talent there, and I think there's too much internal motivation to put all that has troubled him over the course of the last three years behind him in a big way.\n\n\"Going back to the suspension year where you only get him for a couple of games, and then he's injured for a majority of the season. He just has not had a full season, a full offseason to put this whole thing together and see it unfold.\"\n\nWatson underwent surgery on Nov. 21 to repair a displaced fracture to the glenoid in his right (throwing) shoulder. Prior to the season-ending injury, he completed 61.4 percent of his passes for 1,115 yards and seven touchdowns with four interceptions across six games last season.\n\nThe 28-year-old is working his way back from the injury, and the Browns have said they expect him to be ready for the start of the upcoming season, with general manager Andrew Berry making it clear recently that his expectations for Watson are high heading into 2024.\n\nLewis is also optimistic about Watson, who was once widely regarded as a top-tier NFL QB, and Lewis ultimately sees him playing at an elite level again - as long as he can stay on the field.\n\n\"Fingers crossed on the health perspective, as long as all that comes through with the shoulder and everything that had ailed him over the last couple of years,\" Lewis said. \"If you can have a full 17-game season with a player like that, because I really think that's where you start to see the rhythm come into play. That's where you start to see the comfortability with (Browns head coach) Kevin Stefanski come into play. ...\n\n\"So, it's a matter of continuity, and then with that continuity of availability, you get the consistency. And then with the consistency, I think what you start to see is that elite-level play.\"\n\nWatson has passed for 16,756 yards and 118 touchdowns with 45 interceptions in 66 career games with the Browns and Texans since being taken by Houston in the first round (12th overall) of the 2017 draft.\n\nIn his two seasons with the Browns, Watson has completed 59.8 percent of his passes for 2,217 yards, 14 touchdowns and nine interceptions.\n\n-Photo courtesy of Scott Galvin-USA TODAY Sports\n\nA limited number of signed footballs from Clemson's 2022 class are still available.

In Benjamin's ranking, Watson comes is as the 17th ranked QB, ahead of Geno Smith of the Seahawks, Steelers new QB Russell Wilson, ex-Browns QB Baker Mayfield and even Cardinals signal caller Kyler Murray.\n\nAs Benjamin notes, Watson's health remains a big question mark going into his third year with the Browns.\n\nWatson was once considered one of the top five QBs in all of football, which is why the Browns traded three straight years worth of first-round picks among other draft compensation to acquire his services in 2022. At the time, Watson was just two seasons removed from leading the league in passing.\n\nAfter an 11-game suspension derailed his first season in Cleveland, his 2023 campaign was marred by multiple shoulder injuries, including a fracture that wound up requiring surgery. Now, the 2017 first-round pick enters 2024 looking to reclaim a version of himself that fans haven't seen in nearly four years.\n\nIn 12 games over the last two seasons, Watson has thrown for 2,217 yards, 14 touchdowns and nine interceptions. He's rushed for another 317 yards and two more scores. During the team's spring workouts Watson is continuing his rehab from surgery to repair a glenoid fracture in his throwing shoulder. Both Watson and the team expect him to be ready in time for Week 1.\n\nSome of the quarterbacks ahead of Watson include Matthew Stafford of the Rams, Trevor Lawrence of the Jaguars, Kirk Cousins, now of the Falcons and Jared Goff of the Lions. Benjamin's top five includes many of the usual suspects: Patrick Mahomes, tops the list, Josh Allen, Joe Burrow and rookie of the year C.J.

As my dad used to say \"some guys are just good football players.\" Though Thrash and Watson have outstanding measurables, their ability to consistently make plays is what I see on film.\n\nThrash, who played receiver at Georgia State and Louisville, finished his college career with 167 receptions 2,601 yards and 18 touchdowns. His best year was in 2022 at Georgia State where he had 1,122 yards receiving. He ran a very solid 4.46 40-yard dash with a 1.54 10-yard split.\n\nWatson, who ran an impressive 4.63 40 as a 233-pound linebacker, was a tackling machine in the uber-talented SEC. Last year, the former Mississippi State star, led the SEC with 137 total tackles. He also added 10 quarterback sacks, 13 tackles for loss, two forced fumbles, and one interception.\n\nLet's take a look at the strengths, weaknesses and impact of Thrash and Watson.\n\nStrengths - Without question, Thrash's ability to accelerate and decelerate is his greatest gift. Being able to get to top speed, change direction, and vary his pace in routes allows him to create great separation from defensive backs. He can play in the slot or as an outside receiver, and run full route trees from both. He has great body control and spatial awareness which gives him a bigger catch radius than his size (6-foot-1, 188 pounds) suggests.\n\nBelow, Thrash shows some some of his skills with the football in his hands. Watch as he catches the quick screen and immediately gets vertical for a big play.\n\nBelow, Thrash scores a touchdown on an end-around reverse concept. He consistently demonstrates the ability to play multiple receiver positions. His high football IQ and skill set will allow him to back up multiple positions in Cleveland.\n\nWeaknesses - At under 200 pounds, being able to hold up to the punishment in the NFL and stay healthy is always a concern. Thrash's small size can also cause issues in 50/50 balls with bigger NFL cornerbacks. Though an outstanding route runner, Thrash's lack of girth causes him to easily be rerouted by bigger defenders.\n\nImpact for Browns - Developing as an NFL receiver and contributing to special teams will be the initial goal for Thrash. His high football IQ and position flexibility should allow him to compete for the final receiver spot on the roster.\n\nStrengths - Watson (6-2, 233) is a tacking machine and plays best when using his speed and playing downhill, north and south, between A and B gap. The former Bulldog uses his length (81 7/8-inch wingspan) and hands to disengage blockers and get to the ball carrier. Besides his speed and length, Watson plays with the passion and energy every coach desires.\n\nWatson plays with great energy and wants to make every tackle. He is best when he is playing fast and downhill at the line of scrimmage. Below, Watson will act as a spy on the quarterback and chase him down for a sack.\n\nWatson is a relentless football player who exerts with maximum effort at all times. Below, he will blitz inside and get to the quarterback for a sack.\n\nWeaknesses - As good as Watson is stopping the run, he will have to improve his man-to-man coverage skills at the NFL level. Though fast, Watson does not possess the best side-to-side lateral quickness, and that could be exposed by athletic tight ends and running backs.\n\nImpact for Browns - Watson will most likely replace former Brown Sione Takitaki. Not only will Watson replace Takitaki, it would behoove him to take the same path Takitaki took to become a solid linebacker. It starts with special teams. With the new NFL kickoff rules, Watson must use his speed, length, and hands to cover kicks and prevent positive field position for opposing teams. As he becomes a stalwart player on special teams, Watson can learn the NFL game from veterans Jordan Hicks, Devin Bush and Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah.\n\nThrash and Watson may not get much playing time at their respective positions, but can certainly have an immediate impact on special teams. Both are foundational building blocks for the future who can learn the game without the pressure of having to produce right away.", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_Panthers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgia State Panthers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_State_Bulldogs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi State Bulldogs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40-yard_dash", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "40-yard dash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "End-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Bears_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown Bears football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Owusu-Koramoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sione_Takitaki", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sione Takitaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/UECV2VPTVZFWDEEPSFVI6BSSBQ.jpg?auth=ea7eae472769eb4f454b7f683de9560717ab5393a6fd130cc2a694bac6c434b6&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550937", "eventUri": "eng-9550937", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

He's the undrafted free agent who could be on the Broncos roster this season.\n\nJust because a player doesn't get drafted doesn't mean that they can't make it in the NFL. There have been plenty of success stories from undrafted free agents who hit it big in the league. This includes the likes of Kurt Warner, Tony Romo, Warren Moon, Austin Ekeler, Wes Welker, and John Randle, among others. Undrafted free agents can become major difference-makers for teams if they find the right situation for themselves and make the 53-man roster. The Denver Broncos may be the right situation for Memphis running back Blake Watson.\n\nBlake Watson, Running Back, Memphis\n\nOn paper, it may seem like the Broncos' running back room is crowded. Javonte Williams and Samaje Perine held down the top two spots there last season. Another undrafted free agent, Jaleel McLaughlin, shined with the opportunities he was presented with. Denver also drafted Notre Dame back Audric Estime in the fifth round of the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nIt's a loaded room, but Blake Watson has a path to make the roster over at least one of these guys for multiple reasons. For one, Watson was outstanding and versatile during his time at Old Dominion and Memphis. During his final three collegiate seasons, Watson averaged 5.6 yards per carry, totaled 3,195 rushing yards, and scored 27 touchdowns in that span.\n\nWatson was also outstanding in the receiving game. In that same span, he racked up 100 receptions for 849 yards and added six more scores. For comparison's sake, Estime, while more efficient on the ground than Watson, only caught 26 passes in three seasons at South Bend.\n\nWatson wound up averaging 103.5 rushing yards and 39.7 receiving yards per game over his final 20 games. That was about the same marks as what Texas' Jonathon Brooks put up last season. Brooks was the first running back to be drafted in this year's draft.\n\nWatson was an efficiency machine in part because of his ability to make defenders miss and create extra yards. He forced a missed tackle on about 39.3% of his touches, which is the second-best number from a Group of Five running back since 2014. He also averages 4.67 yards after contact, which is a mark that looks very similar to other running backs from Group of Five schools who made it big in the NFL. The film backs those numbers up.\n\nThe Situation\n\nIt's clear that Blake Watson can play and has the skill level to stick in the league. But can he carve a spot on Denver's roster? He has a lot of work to do to prove to the Broncos' coaching staff he's deserving, but the situation in Denver gives him a chance to do so.\n\nThe Broncos clearly believe in his talent because not only did they sign him after drafting Estime, but they gave him a lot of money. Watson got $275,000 in guaranteed money to sign with the Broncos, which is the most any undrafted free agent got at the time of his signing.\n\nSpeaking of money, Denver can keep some by dumping one of their other backs. Denver can save $3 million if they waive Perine during the offseason. For a team that ate an $80 million cap hit when they waived Russell Wilson a few months ago, that extra bit of cash can come in handy down the road.\n\nAlso, Javonte Williams is entering the final year of his rookie contract. He did not look like the same player last season in his first coming back from his torn ACL. He averaged just 3.6 yards per carry and 4.9 yards per reception. Considering Perine's averages were 4.5 and 9.1 and McLaughlin's were 5.4 and 5.2, the state of Denver's offense can't be all to blame for his struggles.\n\nThe present and future of Denver's backfield is in flux at the moment. It's not impossible that Watson can outperform everybody in this room. He was outstanding in college and has arguably the best three-down skillset than anybody on the team. He's someone to monitor. Watson can not only make this team but carve a big role for himself after doing so.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shervon_fakhimi@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Shervon Fakhimi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javonte_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Javonte Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaje_Perine", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samaje Perine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Ekeler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austin Ekeler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Moon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warren Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Warner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kurt Warner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Welker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wes Welker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Romo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tony Romo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Dominion_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Dominion University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Notre Dame Fighting Irish football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Bend,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Bend, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Bend, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Agents", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Agents", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Agents", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Agents", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Agents", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Agents", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/7365794228.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550937", "eventUri": "eng-9550937", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

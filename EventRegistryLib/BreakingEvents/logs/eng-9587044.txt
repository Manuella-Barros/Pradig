In view of the rally at Dwarka in southwest Delhi, police have issued an advisory regarding traffic diversions and asked commuters to avoid certain roads.\n\nPrime Minister Modi's visit to DDA Park in Dwarka sector-14 is scheduled for Wednesday at 6 pm, where he will address a rally. Given the anticipated large turnout, the advisory notes that traffic on the surrounding roads may be significantly impacted. Attendees and commuters in the area should plan accordingly to accommodate potential delays and congestion.\n\nPeople going to bus stand, railway stations and airports are advised to carefully plan their travel. Motorists are advised to keep patience, observe traffic rules and road discipline and follow directions of traffic personnel deployed at all intersections, the advisory said. On Saturday, PM Modi held a rally in northeast Delhi. Earlier on May 20, BJP president JP Nadda presided over a meeting of senior party leaders at the party headquarters in the national capital. According to the information, the meeting was called to review the party's performance so far in the election, which is in its fifth phase, and devise a strategy for the remaining phases.\n\nIt should be noted here that all seven Lok Sabha seats of the national capital will go to the polls on May 25. The national capital is set to witness a riveting showdown between two formidable contenders: the ruling BJP and the formidable I.N.D.I.A. bloc representing the opposition. The political landscape is further enlivened by the alliance between the Congress and AAP, marking a strategic move aimed at challenging the dominant forces. With three parties vying for supremacy, the electoral battleground promises to be intense, with each side mobilising their resources and rhetoric to secure victory in this crucial two-way contest.", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anurag_roushan@indiatvnews.com", "name": "Anurag Roushan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarka", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dwarka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dwarka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Nadda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

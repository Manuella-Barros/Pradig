Its effect on the peace process and everyday life has alarmed many actors, especially those in the international donor community, who have invested billions of dollars to sustain the status quo.\n\nThey need not be troubled: Though the reasons for the Israeli and Palestinian vacuums are different, each will be filled with similar home-grown and entrenched institutions and individuals.\n\nAn increasing number of observers predict that Netanyahu will likely serve a prison sentence in the near future, but this, according to writer Neve Gordon, will mean little for Israel's policies towards the Palestinians.\n\nPotential successors - from Likud's Gideon Saar, to Jewish Home's Naftali Bennett, to Labor's Avi Gabbay, to Yesh Atid's Yair Lapid - hardly hold different views from Netanyahu. In fact, these potential prime ministers are even more racist and invested in Israel's colonial project.\n\nAs Donald Trump entered the White House, Saar called on the Israeli government to \"dissociate from the 'two-states' paradigm and reject the dangerous idea of establishing a Palestinian state in the heart of Israel\", arguing that the \"conditions are ripe for such a move\".\n\nHe has also advocated for \"a Jordanian-Palestinian federative solution\". Bennett, in turn, has called on a number of occasions for the annexation of the West Bank, declaring that the \"era of the Palestinian state is over\".\n\nOPINION: Palestinians expect nothing good from Trump\n\nLast year, Lapid announced: \"We need to get the Palestinians out of our lives. What we have to do is build a high wall and get them out of our sight.\" This sharper turn towards the right, especially when it comes to issues concerning Palestine, will further solidify the institutions and pundits disseminating extreme views, according to analysts and observers.\n\nThis has been a process long in the making, as the recent annual strategic report of Madar - The Palestinian Forum for Israeli Studies reveals. Public opinion polls and trends over the past decade illustrate troubling shifts in Israeli society, such as the rise of radical settler communities, which do not bode well for peace and justice.\n\nPublic responses to Erekat's lung transplant, Elor Azaria's murder trial, and the Hebron settlers who occupied a Palestinian family's house show how far Israeli society remains from engaging in any form of meaningful peace-building project.\n\nAs Gideon Levy argues: \"To generate change, Israeli society has to undergo a painful process, no sign of which is on the horizon ... Netanyahu is going, and Israel is staying the way it was.\" As such, colonial society as a whole - not just the political and security establishments - will rule after Netanyahu.\n\nThe situation is not any better on the Palestinian side, as the political legitimacy gaps expand, the fragmentation deepens, and the internal divide hardens. The fragility of the Palestinian political system has been further exposed in the wake of Abbas's recent medical check-up and the deterioration of Erekat's health.\n\nTo alleviate some of the risk associated with a political transition, Abbas decided to upgrade - once again - his intelligence chief, Majid Faraj.\n\nOver the last decade, the PA and the donor community have invested billions of dollars in the reform of the security establishment. The donor-backed PA leadership is now preparing PA security forces to dominate the post-Abbas period. This does not bode well for democracy, particularly given the PA's mantra of ruling with \"an iron fist\" since 2007.\n\nREAD MORE: Will Mohammed Dahlan return to lead Gaza?\n\nUnder the pretext of ensuring stability and avoiding chaos, the PA has become increasingly authoritarian and used its security forces to solidify its position. In such an environment, it is hard to imagine any meaningful democratic political transition, even if Palestinian National Council elections take place in the fall as currently planned.\n\nThe election as envisaged now is anything but inclusive, transparent or representative. It also risks entrenching the intra-Palestinian divide and creating additional distortions and fragmentation within the Palestinian national movement, analyst Hani al-Masri has warned.\n\nAn additional repressive regime is the last thing that the Palestinian people need. Further PA security establishment control over the Palestinian political system will only weaken an already dysfunctional polity. The political elite will also bolster the security forces' collaboration with Israel, as dictated by the 1993 Oslo Accords.\n\nWhile the current Palestinian leadership characterises this security coordination as \"sacred\", for some future Fatah leaders, it is also \"part and parcel of our liberation strategy\".\n\nIn addition, political leaders will continue to fixate on a failed two-state paradigm and a US-sponsored \"peace process\". Indeed, the Fatah-dominated political elite even finds a source of inspiration in the Trump administration.\n\nLast week, the chief representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Washington declared: \"Our major source of excitement and hope is President Trump himself.\" Whatever comes after Abbas and Netanyahu will, therefore, look similar to what we find today. To change that, there must be resistance to all the trends discussed above.\n\nReal change cannot come from the same institutions that nourished the Netanyahu and Abbas regimes, and neither will it come from the \"leaders\" lining up for the prime ministerial and presidential posts. They, too, are part of the institutional setting that has sustained the Israeli occupation and the status quo.\n\nThe panacea for a real change arises through engaging in contentious collective actions that aim to challenge the existing actors and institutions and their claims of political representation. Fundamentally, this necessitates creating new effective, legitimate and representative institutional bodies that are inclusive, people-driven and participatory by structure and design.\n\nYet the question remains: Though the Palestinian people are desperate for change, is Israeli society interested in it? Or is it happy with Israel the way it is, a settler-colonial state and violator of international law that benefits from the oppression and occupation of a people?", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories":

As a result of the new Israeli security measures in Jerusalem, including adding metal detectors to the Temple Mount (al-Haram al-Sharif) where Al-Aqsa is located, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced on July 23 that the Palestinian Authority (PA) would suspend security coordination with Israel, although there have been no signs yet this suspension is being implemented. In turn, and to show its dominance, Israel took some additional punitive measures, such as raiding offices of Palestinian inspectors in Hebron, announcing the expansion of new illegal settlements near Bethlehem, and arresting more Palestinians, especially in Jerusalem.\n\nThe situation has generated fears among the international community of another intense round of violence and confrontation that could, as in the past, threaten billions of dollars of investments in the Palestinian state-building project over the last decade. The international donor community remembers well when the EU-funded premises, equipment, and PA infrastructure were flattened by the Israeli incursion of the West Bank during the second intifada.\n\nIn case of further escalation, there is little doubt that international investments in security sector reform would suffer. This is a particular worry for the EU, which is the biggest donor to the Palestinian Authority and whose police mission there -- the European Union Police Mission for the Palestinian Territories (EUPOL COPPS) -- prides itself on reforming and overhauling major elements of the Palestinian security establishment and enhancing effective policing.\n\nOn July 4, the European Council extended the mandate of EUPOL COPPS until June 2018. The mission was originally launched in 2006 as part of the EU's Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) in support of the Quartet on the Middle East's roadmap for peace. The mandate of the mission is to support sustainable and effective policing under Palestinian ownership and in accordance with international standards. The technical support provided by EUPOL COPPS to security and justice reforms was expected to lead to Israel's improved trust in the PA's ability to ensure law and order. In turn, Israel's increased security was meant to pave the way for a viable and democratic Palestinian state.\n\nFrom the technical point of view, the mission managed to professionalize the Palestinian Civilian Police (PCP) through capacity-building programs, local and international training, better vehicles and equipment, and contributing to hard and soft policing infrastructure (such as traffic cameras, and drug-control programs, and police stations). The mission has also achieved limited success on judicial reforms by providing technical support and advice to the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Justice, the High Judicial Council, the Attorney General's Office, the Palestinian Anti-Corruption Commission, and the Palestinian Bar Association. In partnership with other donors, the EU and its mission helped the PA to re-establish civil and security control in parts of Area A of the West Bank.\n\nDespite its initial reluctance to allow the EU to play a more significant political role in the region, Israel has endorsed these technical achievements of EUPOL COPPS, realizing the mission can make the PA more effective in policing the West Bank and a more reliable partner in quashing dissent and countering insurgency. Israel perceives EUPOL COPPS as an integral component of the security coordination paradigm that is mainly designed and structured to ensure Israelis' security. It has kept the upper hand by determining what sort of equipment and training the PA police are allowed.\n\nFrom the political point of view, however, the mission has achieved little. Over the last decade, the mission has indeed carved the EU a niche in Palestinian security sector reform and increased its visibility in the Middle East peace process. And for the PA, the mission managed to balance the dominance of the United States, traditionally seen as pro-Israel, as a sponsor of security sector reform. Nevertheless, the EU's strategy to use EUPOL COPPS to pave the way for the democratic and viable state by building its security capacities has fallen short. Instead of reassessing that, the EU insists that the mission has a solely technical mandate.\n\nHowever, the mission cannot escape the political aspect of the conflict, nor the political ramifications of its technical intervention. While the EU generally refrains from supporting security services with a reputation for human rights abuse, such as the U.S.-sponsored Preventive Security agency and the General Intelligence Service, the EU-supported Palestinian Civil Police (PCP) has also been implicated in the excessive use of force against peaceful demonstrations. Consequently, Palestinians increasingly see the EU support as part of a plot to maintain the occupation by proxy.\n\nFurthermore, many Palestinians fear that the ultimate goal of the European and U.S.-led security sector reform of the Palestinian Authority is to silence or criminalize resistance against the Israeli occupation. According to this growing sentiment, this repression results directly from using international aid funds to subcontract the Israeli occupation to the PA. In the words of one inhabitant from the Jenin refugee camp who had been detained by Israel and the PA for the same charges, \"The U.S. security mission is the big and aggressive devil; the European security mission is the small and gentle devil. Both of them are devils, but packaged differently.\"\n\nThe EU and its mission are increasingly becoming complicit in the maintenance of the status quo. If the current authoritarian backslide of the PA continues, the EU and its mission will be increasingly criticized for financing, professionalizing, and legitimizing a highly politicized and democratically unaccountable police force. This is a polar opposite of the EU's foreign policy values and far from its own envisioned approach to security sector reforms.\n\nFilip Ejdus is Marie Curie Fellow at the School of Sociology, Politics, and International Studies at the University of Bristol.

(Ahmad Gharabli/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWhen two soldiers were killed in occupied East Jerusalem a few weeks ago, it set off a chain reaction of Israeli punitive measures, Palestinian protests and violence. The Israeli government ramped up its presence in the Old City, installing metal detectors and security cameras in the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound. Palestinians reacted with mass protest tactics such as boycotting Israeli security measures and collective prayer in the streets of East Jerusalem. And although the Israeli police responded with mass arrests and live fire, the protests grew. After weeks of sustained demonstrations, Israeli authorities reversed the measures, and Palestinians celebrated as trucks filled with security technology drove out of the Old City.\n\nThis was a rare unifying moment for Palestinians, who have been unable to sustain mass, coordinated protests since the second uprising in the early 2000s. What made this moment in Jerusalem a unique rallying point? My research illuminates the effects of repression on collective organizing and mobilization in the Palestinian territories.\n\nWho controls the Palestinian territories?\n\nFollowing the Oslo accords in 1993, the Palestinian territories were split into three main areas: Areas A, B and C, with varying layers of governance. In Area A, the Palestinian Authority (PA) is most free to operate as a quasi-state, Area B features limited PA control, and in Area C the PA is not allowed at all. Many Palestinians thus live in areas partially controlled by two regimes. While this was meant to be a temporary measure, with the PA slated to become the government of a future Palestinian state by 1999, the Israeli government never ceded this authority. Instead it utilized the PA to govern the territories while abdicating responsibility for its policies toward Palestinians.\n\nAs a result, the PA has become increasingly authoritarian. Some have characterized the PA as \"subcontracting repression\" for the occupation. Security coordination between the PA and Israel is a sore point for the Palestinian public, and many complain that the PA has begun operating as a police state. Not only is the police to citizen ratio incredibly high, but the PA has also expanded its purview over journalism, activism and academia. Moreover, human rights organizations have documented that those imprisoned by the PA are subject to beatings and other violent measures.\n\nWhen activists are stuck between two regimes\n\nActivist Basel al-Araj was arrested without charge by the PA for his nonviolent activism against Israel's separation wall. He was tortured while imprisoned with other leftist organizers. Though a publicized hunger strike led to his release, the PA reportedly told Israeli forces when and where he would be released. After months on the run, Israeli soldiers killed Basel in Ramallah on March 6. While extreme, this case is not unique, and many activists have faced similar levels of repression from Palestinian and Israeli authorities alike.\n\nIslamist organizers are also repressed and barred from participating in political life, often to a greater degree than their leftist counterparts. For instance, Islamist student activists have been repeatedly arrested, especially if they attempt to take part in student body elections. This has pushed many members into hiding and to increasingly rely on violent measures.\n\nHow dual repression fractured Palestinian activism\n\nMy recent research on activism in the Palestinian territories confirms that activists often deliberately work \"off the radar\" and publicize events only through word of mouth to trusted allies, to avoid possible PA involvement and/or crackdown.\n\nSuch inhibitions have an effect on group insularity, as well as the efficacy of their collective action efforts. My research also shows that the PA's repressive tactics have polarized Palestinians, making it difficult for groups to coordinate.\n\nThis contrasts with the first uprising that had a unified leadership, allowing the activists to unify tactics and objectives. Today there is no cohesive leadership or even agreement on basic preferences or strategies. My interviews with Palestinians within the PA show a clear divide in Palestinian society. Those who are pro-PA view opposition groups as terrorists, radical Islamists or foreign implants intended to sow dissension. Palestinians in the opposition, on the other hand, view PA supporters as traitors and collaborators. Moreover, recent polling shows that Palestinians are almost evenly split on their support for the Palestinian Authority as an institution.\n\nMore space for mobilization without the PA\n\nBased on statistical analysis of protests in the territories since the second uprising, political mobilization has declined systematically in places where the Palestinian Authority has direct control (Area A). Attempts to protest Basel al-Araj's death in Ramallah were quickly and violently repressed. Protests in his home village of Al-Walaja, on the other hand, were large and unimpeded. Mobilizations in rural areas with limited or no PA control are now actually on the rise. Villages like Bil'in, Nabi Saleh and Kufr Qaddum are often in the news for their regular protests against the occupation, the separation wall and settlements.\n\nCounterintuitively, although all three areas of the West Bank face Israeli repression, political mobilization today is actually less prevalent in areas where the PA operates. This finding suggests that the PA does, in fact, play a role in the decline of political mobilization and engagement.\n\nDuring the July protests in Jerusalem, the PA and its leadership were always a step behind. They had nothing to do with the coordination of the protests and could do little to stop them. Local religious figures, particularly the Islamic Waqf, took the lead on calls for protest and formulating the Palestinian position. Christian leadership followed suit. Jerusalemites responded with high levels of participation, developing their repertoires of protest by relying on preexisting norms, like prayer times.\n\nMy findings also help explain why the Jerusalem protests were effective: East Jerusalem, despite having been occupied in 1967 like the rest of the Palestinian territories, is unique in its lack of PA institutions. Palestinians there do not face an added layer of repression from an indigenous regime.\n\nAnd although the occupation is repressive, how people react to an externally imposed force differs from how they react to their own leadership. While the occupation can spur rebellion, the PA's direct repression in the areas it governs exacerbates polarization and affects the ability of different groups to coordinate. This is precisely why today we see increased mobilization in places we wouldn't expect: rural farming communities and East Jerusalem suburbs. Until we see a change in the Palestinian Authority's role, the locus of mobilization will continue to shift in unexpected ways.\n\nDana El Kurd earned her PhD in government from the University of

of time in 2015, only about 8,500 returned.\n\nThe number shows a significant rise in the exit rate and a fall in the return rate compared to previous years.\n\nThe regime in Israel have been under fire by the international community over efforts to change the demographic build-up of the occupied territories over the past decades by constructing illegal settlements, destroying historical Palestinian sites and expelling the local Palestinian population.\n\nThe occupied territories have been the scene of a new wave of tensions between Palestinians and Israeli forces since 2015, when the regime imposed restrictions on the entry of Muslim worshippers into the al-Aqsa Mosque compound.\n\nMany Israelis view the regime's decades-long occupation of Palestinian lands as a source of tensions with Palestinians.\n\nIn recent months, Tel Aviv has witnessed a number of protest rallies in support of a Palestinian state and in condemnation of the Israeli occupation.\n\nIsrael's leftist opposition has criticized the right-wing administration of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over its failure to pursue a \"peace process\" with the Palestinians.\n\nThe regime's short existence has been marked by several deadly wars against the region's Arab population, including Palestinians and Lebanese.\n\nSince 2008, the regime has killed hundreds of Palestinian civilians in its last three wars on Gaza Strip, without achieving the goal of its costly campaigns, which is crushing Palestinian resistance.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri":

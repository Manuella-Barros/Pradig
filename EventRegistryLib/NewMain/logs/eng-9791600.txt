These models, heavily reliant on assumptions, can introduce risks if those assumptions don't pan out, affecting credit risk management, compliance, and reputational standing. Financial institutions are now required to draft board-approved policies detailing why third-party models are used and cover their entire life cycle. Moreover, any deployment or changes in these credit models need the green light from the entity's risk management committee and must be validated before and after any modifications.\n\nWith the RBI advising non-bank finance companies to not overly depend on algorithm-based credit models or over-lend in specific market segments, this move may lead to a reduction in market volatility. Investors might see this as a stabilization effort, promoting healthier credit markets and reducing the risk of defaults caused by over-lending.\n\nThe bigger picture: Guardrails for growth.\n\nThe RBI's directive, effective in three months, aims to foster a more resilient financial ecosystem in India. Annual reviews of credit models and mandatory independent validation processes ensure that entities stay on top of their risk management game.

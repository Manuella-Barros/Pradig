Because they're distracted by international politics, sometimes people forget what Micron does and how innovative the company really is. Ultimately, however, Micron stock succeeds because the company delivers best-in-class hardware.\n\nThis doesn't mean you should disregard international tensions. At the same time, successful Micron investors will take a \"This, too, shall pass\" perspective and stay in the trade for best results.\n\nLike that old Top Gun movie from the 1980s, Micron has a \"need for speed.\" This is especially true for Micron's recently unveiled SSDs, which are truly top-of-the-line.\n\nGamers, and anyone who uses a mini-personal computer or ultrathin laptop, should appreciate should appreciate Micron's newly available Crucial P310 2230 Gen4 NVMe SSD. This SSD will make your head spin, with \"read and write speeds of 7,100 and 6,000 megabytes per second, respectively,\" and \"capacities up to 2 terabytes.\"\n\nFor all of you artificial intelligence junkies out there, Micron just introduced the 9550 NVMe SSD. This is, according to Micron, the \"world's fastest data center SSD and industry leader in AI workload performance and power efficiency.\"\n\nHow fast is the Micron 9550 NVMe SSD? With speedy sequential data reads and writes, it provides \"up to 67% better performance over similar competitive SSDs.\" In other words, it's lightning-fast by industry standards.\n\nMicron is a known revenue grower and respected tech-hardware innovator. Yet, because of the market's nervousness, Micron stock pulled back sharply from its 52-week high of $157.54 not long ago.\n\nWhy was the market nervous? Rest assured, it wasn't Micron's fault. Mainly, the share-price pullback occurred because of a rotation from large-cap technology stocks to small-cap stocks.\n\nThis happened as the Biden administration considered tightening restrictions on U.S. exports of powerful tech hardware to China. Concurrently, former president and current presidential candidate Donald Trump suggested that Taiwan \"did take about 100% of [America's] chip business\" and \"should pay us for defense.\"\n\nIf you've been investing for a long time, then you've surely witnessed political posturing and brinkmanship before. This is normal during election cycles, and so far, it hasn't resulted in the world ending or Micron collapsing.\n\nMizuho Securities analyst Jordan Klein doesn't seem to be losing sleep over international trade tensions. He considers a \"pullback and risk-off trade into July earnings season\" as a good thing, actually. This can \"lower expectations and very elevated and euphoric investor positioning / sentiment in the semi sector.\"\n\nTo put it another way, investors' nervousness will bring volatility, and volatility will bring opportunity. So, if you still consider Micron to be a great company with outstanding products, why not go ahead and \"buy the dip?\"\n\nMicron Technology has outstanding value because the company never ceases to innovate. Indeed, Micron's ultrafast SSDs are recent examples of the company setting new industry standards.\n\nHence, levelheaded investors don't need to freak out about international trade frictions. Micron will surely survive and thrive - and whenever Micron stock gives you a dip, just buy some and then watch it rip.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Meanwhile, smartphones, PCs, and servers are integrating more dynamic random access memory (DRAM) to keep pace with AI's demands. This year alone, DRAM in smartphones and notebooks is expected to rise 14% and 12%, respectively, while servers could see a 17.3% boost.\n\nMicron Technology, Inc. (MU) is riding this growth wave with a booming bottom line and thriving in the high-bandwidth memory market, fueling AI's relentless data hunger. However, with mixed earnings from mega-cap tech companies contributing to a widespread sell-off in the market lately, MU stock has now dropped over 40% from its June peak.\n\nFor investors who have been waiting for AI stocks to cool down from their recently stretched valuations, this dip in Micron stock could offer a prime opportunity for those looking to buy shares of a dividend-paying semiconductor stock with AI-driven growth potential.\n\nFounded in 1978, Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) is a leading manufacturer of innovative memory and storage solutions, providing essential tech for industries like computing, networking, and mobile communications. With a market cap of $121.8 billion, this powerhouse crafts cutting-edge DRAM, NAND Flash, and SSDs, making essential components for today's digital world.\n\nDespite a steep pullback from their June highs, shares of Micron have surged 35.9% over the past 52 weeks, outperforming the S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) 18.5% returns and the iShares Semiconductor ETF's (SOXX) 20.4% gains.\n\nOn July 23, Micron Technology paid its shareholders a quarterly dividend of $0.115 per share. The tech-hardware innovator offers an annualized dividend of $0.46 per share, resulting in a yield of 0.42%. Furthermore, it maintains a payout ratio of 28.87%, which provides room for growth initiatives and potential future dividend hikes.\n\nPriced at 7.32 times sales, Micron Technology trades at a discount to many of its large-cap semiconductor peers.\n\nMicron Technology's Q3 Beats Wall Street Projections\n\nMicron reported solid fiscal Q3 earnings results on June 26, smashing past Wall Street's forecasts. Its total revenue rose 81.6% annually to $6.8 billion, fueled by strong demand for memory and storage products, especially in the AI sector. Its adjusted EPS climbed to $0.62 from a year-ago loss of $1.43 per share, also topping estimates.\n\nKey to this success was Micron's focus on high-margin products like High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), which generated over $100 million in HBM3E revenue with strong margins. HBM's critical role in AI systems, offering better performance and lower power consumption, underscores Micron's market leadership. Additionally, the company's data center SSD revenue hit a record, doubling sequentially, reflecting robust AI-driven demand across DRAM and NAND.\n\nDespite the solid Q3 report, shares of Micron Technology still dipped 7.1% on the news as investors reacted to in-line revenue guidance. The semiconductor company projected $7.6 billion in revenue, which failed to meet the high bar for growth that some anticipated. This overshadowed Micron's forecast for positive free cash flow growth during Q4.\n\nWhile the future looks promising, Micron faces challenges like tight memory supply and reliance on high-margin products like HBM, which carry their own risks if demand shifts.\n\nAnalysts tracking Micron Technology predict EPS of $0.58 in fiscal 2024, bouncing back from its 2023 loss, with the bottom line projected to surge to $8.75 in fiscal 2025.\n\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for Micron Technology Stock?\n\nAmid recent volatility in semiconductor stocks, Bank of America's Vivek Arya backed his \"Buy\" rating on Micron on July 29.\n\nAnalysts are upbeat about MU stock's prospects, with a consensus \"Strong Buy\" rating overall. Among the 27 analysts covering the stock, 24 are highly bullish with a \"Strong Buy,\" two advise a \"Moderate Buy,\" and the one suggests a \"Hold.\"\n\nThe mean price target for MU is $164.26, indicating an upside potential of 77.2% from current levels. The Street-high target price is $225, via analyst Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities.\n\nOn the date of publication, Sristi Suman Jayaswal did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

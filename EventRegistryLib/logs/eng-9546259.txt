Limmer went much later than expected after being graded as a fourth-round prospect by The Athletic's Dane Brugler and a fifth-rounder by NFL.com's Lance Zierlein, so the Rams got great value in Round 6.\n\nLimmer spent his college career at Arkansas and was a standout lineman at both center and guard, bringing excellent position flexibility to the Rams' offensive line. Here are five things to know about the rookie lineman.\n\n1 He squatted 700 pounds in 2023 (and could have done more)\n\nVasha Hunt-USA TODAY Sports\n\nLimmer is a strong, strong man. According to Dane Brugler of The Athletic, he was a competitive powerlifter in high school and had a personal best of squatting 515 pounds. He also put up 360 pounds on the bench and 485 in the deadlift, and that was back in high school.\n\nLast year, he blew away his previous record squat by putting up 700 pounds in July. According to the strength coach, he could've done more if they let him, too.\n\n2 Had most bench press reps of any player at 2024 NFL combine\n\nKirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nLimmer unsurprisingly dominated the bench press test at the NFL combine this year. He put up 225 pounds 39 times, five more than any other player at the combine. It was the most since Netane Muti had 44 reps in 2020, just to put his performance into perspective.\n\nLimmer also had the fourth-best vertical (36.5) of any lineman this year. Needless to say, he's quite athletic and powerful.\n\n3 Led Arkansas in snaps played each of the last two years\n\nPetre Thomas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nLimmer hardly ever came off the field for the Razorbacks. In 2022, he played a team-high 983 offensive snaps and last year, he played 809 offensive snaps, once again the most on the team. He gained a lot of experience during his time with Arkansas, which should prepare him well for the NFL.\n\n4 Earned 3rd-best PFF grade of any SEC lineman in 2022\n\nBrett Rojo-USA TODAY Sports\n\nLimmer played 12 games at right guard in 2022, as well as one game (bowl game) at center, putting together a strong season all year. He only allowed four sacks during the season and was heralded as one of the best guards in the country.\n\nAccording to PFF, he had the third-highest grade of any guard in the SEC that year, which put him on analysts' radars as a future draft pick.\n\n5 One of three Power 5 guards with 80-plus grades in pass and run blocking in 2022\n\nPetre Thomas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nLimmer needs to improve in pass protection but in college, he was great as a pass blocker and in the run game. Pro Football Focus gave him grades of at least 80.0 in pass protection and as a run blocker, making him one of just three Power 5 guards to accomplish that feat in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "theramswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rams Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_dasilva@theramswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Cameron DaSilva", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squatting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Squatting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Zierlein", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lance Zierlein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Scouting_Combine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL Scouting Combine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bench_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bench press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerlifting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Powerlifting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Five_conferences", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Power Five conferences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_Razorbacks_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas Razorbacks football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowl game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://theramswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2024/04/6_217_lar_beaux-limmer_c_ark_hero.png?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546259", "eventUri": "eng-9546259", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The suspect fled in his blue, early 2000s Ford pickup truck.\n\nLimmer's family said he was always trying to help out in situations like that he faced at McDonald's.\n\nHe was a graduate of the University of Texas at Austin and South Texas College of Law and worked for the Houston law firm of Lewis Brisbois.\n\nCrime Stoppers of Houston is offering a reward of up to $5,000 for information leading to Landry's arrest and conviction, police said.\n\nFor the latest true crime and justice news, subscribe to the 'Crime Stories with Nancy Grace' podcast.", "source": {"uri": "crimeonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crime Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kc_wildmoon@crimeonline.com", "name": "Kc Wildmoon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Texas_College_of_Law_Houston", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Texas College of Law Houston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Grace", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Grace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "True crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_Stoppers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime Stoppers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Texas at Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pickup truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://co-a2.azureedge.net/co-static/images/co_540x540.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546259", "eventUri": "eng-9546259", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 452992464, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 48, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 48}}}

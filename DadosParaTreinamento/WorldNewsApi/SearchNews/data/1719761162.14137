The presiding judge , Justice Ayokunle Faji, apart from forfeiting the mentioned sum, also, ordered the EFCC to published the interim forfeiture order in a national newspaper, for anyone interested in the money sought to be forfeited to appear before the Court and show cause within 14 days, why the final order of forfeiture of the said sum should not be made in favour of the Federal Government of Nigeria. The judge, made the orders, while granting an Exparte motion marked FHC/L/CS/232/2024, moved by Mrs. Bilikisu Buhari-Bala, lawyer to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The money forfeited in the interim is said to be in Donatone Limited\u2019s account number: 2000000500 domiciled in Titan Bank Limited. Buhari-Bala, while asking the court to grant the orders told the court that the orders sought for are pursuant to Section 17 of the Advance Fee Fraud and other fraud-related Offences Act No. 14, 2006, and Section 44 (2)(B) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. She also informed the court the grounds for the orders are: \u201cthat this honourable court has the statutory powers under the provisions of section 17 of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Related Offences Act, 2006 to grant the reliefs being sought. \u201cThat the funds sought to be forfeited are reasonably suspected to be proceeds of unlawful activities.\u201d Mrs. Buhari-Bala also told the court that he motion Exparte is supported with an affidavit deposed to by one David Jayeoba, an investigator with the EFCC. In the affidavit, the deponent stated that his commission received a credible and directed intelligence which led to the tracing of funds reasonably suspected to be proceeds of unlawful activities warehoused in the Donatone Limited (DL) Titan Trust Bank account, which funds are reasonably suspected to be part of proceeds of unlawful activities. The deponent stated that the EFCC, whilst investigating the monumental fraud carried out by the erstwhile Centra Bank of Nigeria Governor, Mr Godwin Emefiele (GE) and his Cronies, discovered a huge amount of money warehoused and concealed in the account of Donatone Limited, domiciled in Titan Trust Bank. He stated that investigation revealed that some of the brains behind the fraudulent concealment of funds reasonably suspected to have been proceeds of unlawful activities of the erstwhile Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Governor, Mr Godwin Emefiele, are the natural persons behind Donatone Limited, Uzeobo Anthony and Adebanjo Olurotimi, who are directors Donatone Limited. The deponent further stated the followings: \u201cBetween 2021 and 2022, when accessibility to Forex in Nigeria was difficult, several international entities operating in Nigeria had to resort to different means to source Forex. \u201cThat Uzeobo Anthony and Adebanjo Olurotimi used the firm, to collect bribes and gratification on behalf of Godwin Emefiele, to get approval for accessing Forex. And that one of the entities (NP) paid a total sum of $26,552 million USD, into the account of firm domiciled in Titan Trust account number 2000000500. \u201cThat the said credits came into the account of firm on November 9, 2021: $6,450,000; November 5, 2021: $6,050,000.00; December 16, 2021: $5,400,000.00; December 23, 2021: $652,000; January 31 2022; $3,000,000.00 and September 21, 2022: $5,000,000.00. \u201cThe investigation traced the funds to having been fixed into interest-yielding accounts, dissipated and laundered through a foreign account in Mauritius, and transported back to Nigeria under disguise. \u201cThat of the total sum of $26, 555, 000.00 US dollars received by firm, the balance standing in the said account as at today is the sum of $1, 426, 175.14 million USD. \u201cThat it is the balance in the account that the applicant seeks to forfeit to the Federal Government of Nigeria, which has been traced to be the proceeds of unlawful activities of (GE) and his cronies. And that investigation further revealed that the international entities sourcing for forex were pressured into parting with huge funds to access forex during the period. \u201cThat the signatories to the account warehousing the sum of $1, 426, 175.14 million USD, sought to be forfeited are at large and are making frantic efforts to dissipate the funds electronically. And that based on our investigation findings, the funds sought to be forfeited are proceeds of unlawful activities of (GE) and his cronies. And that it is in the interest of justice to grant this application.\u201d Justice Faji, after granted the orders, adjourned the matter to June 25, for hearing of the final forfeiture of the money.

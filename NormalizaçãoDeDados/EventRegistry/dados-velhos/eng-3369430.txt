It's a huge estimate. We were able to bring down the cost of production from $78 per barrel to $23 per barrel and we are charged to further drop it to 17 dollars per barrel for 2018.\n\n\"We've be been able save about $3billion to $5 billion U.S. dollars since we came in,\" he said.\n\nSejebor said another achievement was that international partners, who were reluctant to invest in the upstream oil and gas, had agreed to a payoff deal that would not tamper with the nation's income.\n\n\"The implication of them not investing is that production continues to drop and facilities decay. That was scary because if you allow that to continue, operations could die in five years.\n\n\"We sat down with them and they said we owed in cash call arrears and then we negotiated a way to pay back without tampering with the cash flow coming into the federation account to forestall drop in revenue.\n\n\"Also, we turned around our contracting circle from between two and three years to six months,'' the Group General Manager said.\n\nCommenting on how he had curtailed corruption, Sejebor said the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) had policy guidelines, procedures and processes on how to discipline erring staff.\n\n\"Such erring staff will be referred to a disciplinary committee. If found wanting, we have our various penalties.\n\n\"If it is a financial crime it goes to EFCC, but if it's a corruption against NNPC itself, it goes to ICPC.\"\n\nHe said that as at 2015, there were five years accounts that were not prepared and normal governance meetings did not hold.\n\n\"But we have been able to clear the backlog. 2016 accounts would be ready by December.\n\n\"NAPIMS was able to achieve all these in a short period because all we did was to change our attitude towards work and in the way we carry out operations.\n\n\"We worked tirelessly round the clock to clear all backlog of legacy contracts in order to close our books and balance our accounts to show that NNPC has nothing to hide\".\n\nSejebor urged the media to always double-check negative reports before going to press.\n\n\"While trying to drive this change and run an upright establishment, we are bound to make mistakes, please cross-check with us before publishing.\n\n\"When a change is being made, you will meet with resistance who will fight you every step of the way.\n\n\"When you are dealing with contractors that are not used to losing they will go all out to smear your name, please when the media encounters this please cross-check with us.\"\n\nHe urged media practitioners to educate themselves on the petroleum policy, which he said, was \"straight forward, written in simple, easy to understand language,\" to deter unwarranted allegations.\n\nEarlier, while inaugurating the anti-corruption committee, Sejebor said: \"it's a milestone to bring corruption to zero level in NAPIMS because we have a zero-tolerance for corruption.\n\n\"We came in August 2015 at a time when oil prices crashed and investments came to zero, but today we've been able to sit down with our partners, operators to arrest the situation, re-negotiate interest, exit cash-call and the strategy worked.\n\n\"Production also dropped to less than a million barrels a day as at that time due to militancy and other issues but as we speak today we've been able to resolve issues and as we speak now production is at 2.3 million barrels a day.\n\n\"Accountability, transparency should be our watchword.

It's a huge estimate. We were able to bring down the cost of production from $78 per barrel to $23 per barrel and we are charged to further drop it to 17 dollars per barrel for 2018.\n\n\"We've been able to save about $3bn to $5bn since we came in,\" he said.\n\nSejebor said another achievement was that international partners, who were reluctant to invest in the upstream oil and gas, had agreed to a payoff deal that would not tamper with the nation's income.\n\n\"The implication of them not investing is that production continues to drop and facilities decay. That was scary because if you allow that to continue, operations could die in five years.\n\n\"We sat down with them and they said we owed in cash call arrears and then we negotiated a way to pay back without tampering with the cash flow coming into the federation account to forestall drop in revenue.\n\n\"Also, we turned around our contracting circle from between two and three years to six months,'' the Group General Manager said.\n\nCommenting on how he had curtailed corruption, Sejebor said the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation had policy guidelines, procedures and processes on how to discipline erring staff.\n\n\"Such erring staff will be referred to a disciplinary committee. If found wanting, we have our various penalties.\n\n\"If it is a financial crime it goes to EFCC, but if it's a corruption against NNPC itself, it goes to ICPC,\" he said.\n\nHe said that as at 2015, there were five years accounts that were not prepared and normal governance meetings did not hold.\n\n\"But we have been able to clear the backlog. 2016 accounts would be ready by December.\n\n\"NAPIMS was able to achieve all these in a short period because all we did was to change our attitude towards work and in the way we carry out operations.\n\n\"We worked tirelessly round the clock to clear all backlog of legacy contracts in order to close our books and balance our accounts to show that NNPC has nothing to hide,\" he said.\n\nSejebor urged the media to always double-check negative reports before going to press.\n\n\"While trying to drive this change and run an upright establishment, we are bound to make mistakes, please cross-check with us before publishing.\n\n\"When a change is being made, you will meet with resistance who will fight you every step of the way.\n\n\"When you are dealing with contractors that are not used to losing they will go all out to smear your name, please when the media encounters this please cross-check with us,\" he said.\n\nHe urged media practitioners to educate themselves on the petroleum policy, which he said, was \"straight forward, written in simple, easy to understand language,\" to deter unwarranted allegations.\n\nEarlier, while inaugurating the anti-corruption committee, Sejebor said, \"it's a milestone to bring corruption to zero level in NAPIMS because we have a zero-tolerance for corruption.\n\n\"We came in August 2015 at a time when oil prices crashed and investments came to zero, but today we've been able to sit down with our partners, operators to arrest the situation, re-negotiate interest, exit cash-call and the strategy worked.\n\n\"Production also dropped to less than a million barrels a day as at that time due to militancy and other issues but as we speak today we've been able to resolve issues and as we speak now production is at 2.3 million barrels a day.\n\n\"Accountability, transparency should be our watchword.

that the country had saved a minimum of $3bn per annum.Sejebor said NAPIMS arrived at the figure after looking at the difference between the $78 and $23, representing the old and new cost of production in relation to the current daily average production in the country.\n\nHe was quoted in a statement issued by the corporation's spokesperson, Ndu Ughamadu, as saying \"If you knock down your cost of production from $78 per barrel to $23, take the difference and multiply by the average daily production, you will discover that we are saving a minimum of $3bn in the upstream for both Production Sharing Contracts and Joint Ventures.\"\n\nHe said the target was to bring the cost of production to $17 and $19 for onshore and offshore production, respectively.\n\nSejebor commended the Federal Government for its support to the NNPC management in tackling the challenges in the petroleum industry, especially the cash call exit agreement signed in 2016 and the reduction of contracting circle from three years to six months.\n\nOn the new petroleum policy, he said it was necessitated by the increasing difficulty in operating the petroleum industry within the framework of the old Petroleum Act in the face of the delayed passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill.\n\nSejebor said the policy would restore investors' confidence in the industry pending the full passage of the entire

On the other side of the coin, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq produce oil at $8.98/b, $9.08/b and $10.57/b respectively.\n\nIn a move that could impact negatively on Nigeria's spot crude export market, India and South Korea, arguably two of Asia's largest importers of crude oil have reportedly diversified their crude sources in favour of the cheaper and attractive price offerings for US crude grade West Texas Intermediate (WTI).\n\nTherefore, disclosing the latest development during the inauguration of National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS) Anti-Corruption Committee, the unit's Group General Manager, Engr. Dafe Sejebor said by the action, the country had saved a minimum of $3 billion per annum.\n\nEngr. Sejebor said NAPIMS arrived at the figure after looking at the difference between the $78 and $23 which represent the old and new cost of production in relation to the present daily average production in the country.\n\nProduction costs are calculated by including a mix of capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operational expenditures. CAPEX include the costs involved with building oil facilities, pipelines and new wells. Operational expenditures included the costs of lifting oil out of the ground, paying employee salaries and general administrative duties as well as transport.\n\nAccording to a recent study by Rystad Energy, prior to the latest reduction in oil production cost, Nigeria's CAPEX was put at $13.10 per barrel of oil, while it costs $8.81 to actually lift the oil out of the ground. Administrative costs, which include employee salaries and transportation were put at $2.97, while gross taxes cost a sum of $4.11 per barrel.\n\nThese figures reveal that CAPEX, production costs, admin/transport and taxes constitute 45.2%, 30.4%, 10.2% and 14.2% of the cost of producing one barrel of oil in Nigeria.\n\nIn a related study by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), statistics show that Nigeria needs oil to sell at $122 per barrel in order to break even. This is a major concern as the budgets of oil producing countries continue to suffer from oil price decrease along with its attendant challenges for meeting government exspenditure.\n\nParticularly, the location of Nigeria's lucrative oil fields also contribute to driving its production costs up, as due to unrest in the NIgeri Delta, many newer projects are focuses offshore, where production is more secure but capital investment required is higher. Transportation costs rank averagely when compred to other oil producing nations such as Indonesia $3.63, Norway $3.12 and the UK $4.30. Finally, taxes paid to the federal government also influence the high cost of crude production in the country.\n\nThe GGM noted that the target was to bring the cost of production to between $17 and $19 for onshore and offshore production respectively.\n\n\"If you knock down your cost of production from $78 per barrel to $23, take the difference and multiply by the average daily production, you will discover that we are saving a minimum of $3 billion in the upstream for both Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) and Joint Ventures (JVs)\", he said.\n\nHe commended the Federal Government for its support to the NNPC management in tackling the challenges in the petroleum industry, especially the cash call exit agreement signed in 2016 and the reduction of contracting circle from three years to six months.\n\nOn the new Petroleum Policy, Engr. Sejebor said it was necessitated by the increasing difficulty in operating the petroleum industry within the framework of the old Petroleum Act in the face of the delayed passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB).\n\nHe said the policy would restore investors' confidence in the industry pending the full passage of the entire PIB by the National Assembly.", "id": "9673250", "details": {},

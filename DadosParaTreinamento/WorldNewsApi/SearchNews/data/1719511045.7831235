Chief Oluwasegun David, an advocate of the sports made the call in Akure, Ondo State capital, when the Segun Giwa-led leadership of Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN), Ondo State chapter paid him a courtesy visit at his pool lounge. He called for increase in the awareness and development of the sports with a view to identifying and nurture talented individuals from the grassroots level and propel them to international success through instructing them in the standardized, globally recognized techniques of the game. The sports advocate disclosed that he invested a lot in procuring the approved standard pool (A-board) at his at his entertainment hub, Fourteen75 Lounge due to his love for the game. He revealed that he was out to attract players to play to international standards and nurture talents to participate in pool competitions in China. Describing game with passion, David said: \u201cPool is a popular cue sport played on a table with six pockets, where players use a cue stick to strike balls and score points and requires skill, strategy, and focus. It\u2019s enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels, from casual players to professional competitors.\u201d He, therefore, sought the support of sports journalists in the state to promote the game, describing the game as a career-driven sport to discover talents who find interest in playing the game. The Ayede Ekiti-born pool advocate sought the support of Ondo SWAN to propagate the benefit of the pool game, stressing that Disclosing that there would be a championship playoff scheduled to hold in June in Akure, with his pool lounge to host a competition to produce two representatives, the Aiyedatiwa Ekiti-born sports lover declared that the game was not meant for the rich and gamblers only. He said: \u201cIn terms of corporate organizations, some people have taken it as a career and so, we need to see it more as a sport, not just a game for gamblers. \u201cThe US for instance and the Europeans employ a brand organisation to rebrand it. Before, players could wear anything to competition, but now, there is a dress code and there are rules. \u201cThe pool itself is the billiard game and being governed by the World Pool Association (WPA). They have come up with a lot of things on how to make the game much better and to be appealing not only to young people but to sponsors, the basic thing is that they want to catch in. \u201cWe invested on this board as well in Akure, now, I have close to over hundred players that come here regularly to play. Some come as early as 8am, some as early as 7am to play. \u201cSo, it is a gradual process, we started with one board. Two years ago, we added another board, and this year we added the third one. So, with the Bing board for instance, what I have also done is that you can not bet on that board if you want to learn how to play the sport. \u201cIf you want to be good at it, if you want to go to China and play in competitions, this is the board you play on. In Nigeria, we only have three places that have the pool table; Lagos has one, Akure has one and Asaba has one.\u201d The Chairman of SWAN in Ondo State, Segun Giwa, therefore, assured of the association\u2019s readiness to support the pool game by giving it the deserved publicity. He disclosed that he would partner with the Ondo State Sports Council and Ministry of Youths and Sports to see how the game could be incorporated and promoted to encourage talents to take interest in the sport. Giwa noted that SWAN could also organize a competition on the game after taking members through the rudiments and rules of the game.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"1014\" height=\"379\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240526-WA0024.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240526-WA0024.jpg 1014w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240526-WA0024-300x112.jpg 300w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240526-WA0024-768x287.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1014px) 100vw, 1014px\" /></div>\u2026Urges Ondo SWAN To Promote The Game Sports ministries and enthusiasts have been charged to support Billiard Sports and pool sports in the country.

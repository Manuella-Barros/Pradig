That means there is no word as of yet on whether Sutherland will return as counterterrorism agent Jack Bauer.\n\nSutherland played Bauer across all eight seasons of the show's original run on Fox, which aired from 2001 to 2014, and the television film 24: Redemption, which aired between Seasons 6 and 7. He also reprised the role for the limited event spinoff series 24: Live Another Day in 2014.\n\nThe show won multiple Primetime Emmys across its run, including Outstanding Drama Series and Outstanding Lead Actor for Sutherland in 2006. Sutherland also won a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Drama Series in 2001.\n\nSutherland has previously said he is open to returning to the 24 universe, noting how he believes Bauer's story was left \"unresolved.\"\n\nRelated\n\nSee Kiefer Sutherland's Touching Tribute to His Father Donald Sutherland Following His Death\n\n\"I miss it. It was an incredible experience,\" Sutherland told GQ Magazine in a 2022 interview. \"I have learned that you're just better off not to be definitive about your answer of whether you will do something or not do something. I love playing that character. I do believe the story is unresolved.\"\n\nHe continued, \"If something were to be written that made sense to me and that I thought was going to contribute to the franchise then I would be behind it, even if my participation in that were to be limited.\"\n\nSutherland most recently starred in the Paramount+ spy thriller Rabbit Hole, where he played a private espionage agent framed for murder. The series was canceled after one season.\n\nMore Headlines:\n\n'Jeopardy!'

He last played the character in the 24 event series, also known as 24: Live Another Day, which aired on Fox in 2014.\n\n24 [is] a movie that we're going to do in a very interesting way.\n\nImagine Entertainment co-founder Brian Grazer let slip about the project on MSNBC's Squawk Box in June, on which he also revealed that a Backdraft reboot is in the works with Glen Powell.\n\n\"Imagine has always played in that zone where there is that high probability chance that it will be successful in movie theaters,\" Grazer stated. \"It's great for us because we've built, over 30 years, over 100 different products and brands, whether it's Backdraft, which I'm now going to do today with Glen Powell, or whether it's 24, a movie that we're going to do in a very interesting way with Disney and Fox.\"\n\nRumors of a 24 continuation or spin-off have swirled for years. Fox was said to be planning some offshoots from the flagship series in 2018, including a prequel with a young Jack Bauer, but that idea was scrapped two years later. The network returned to the drawing board in 2021, actively discussing how to bring 24 back.\n\nSutherland then revealed in 2022 that he would be open to playing Bauer again if all the cards fell into place, especially since he feels his character's story on 24 remains somewhat \"unresolved.\"\n\nThe original series ran for nine seasons, most of which consisted of 24 episodes to cover 24 hours of events in real-time. The series premiered on Fox in 2001 and aired its final episode when Season 8 concluded in 2010. Sutherland returned as Bauer in 2014 for 24: Live Another Day, with a story told across 12 episodes.\n\nFox also tried a spin-off titled 24: Legacy, which premiered in 2017. Sutherland executive-produced the series but did not reprise his role as Bauer. Instead, Corey Hawkins led the show as an ex-Army Ranger named Eric Carter. It only lasted one season, though Fox later shared plans to develop a new incarnation of 24.\n\nAdele Ankers-Range is a freelance entertainment writer for IGN.

That means there is no word as of yet on whether Sutherland will return as counterterrorism agent Jack Bauer.\n\nSutherland played Bauer across all eight seasons of the show's original run on Fox, which aired from 2001 to 2014, and the television film 24: Redemption, which aired between Seasons 6 and 7. He also reprised the role for the limited event spinoff series 24: Live Another Day in 2014.\n\nThe show won multiple Primetime Emmys across its run, including Outstanding Drama Series and Outstanding Lead Actor for Sutherland in 2006. Sutherland also won a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Drama Series in 2001.\n\nSutherland has previously said he is open to returning to the 24 universe, noting how he believes Bauer's story was left \"unresolved.\"\n\n\"I miss it. It was an incredible experience,\" Sutherland told GQ Magazine in a 2022 interview. \"I have learned that you're just better off not to be definitive about your answer of whether you will do something or not do something. I love playing that character. I do believe the story is unresolved.\"\n\nHe continued, \"If something were to be written that made sense to me and that I thought was going to contribute to the franchise then I would be behind it, even if my participation in that were to be limited.\"\n\nSutherland most recently starred in the Paramount+ spy thriller Rabbit Hole, where he played a private espionage agent framed for murder.

This includes Academy Award-winning producer and co-founder of Imagine Entertainment, Brian Grazer, who has revealed that Powell is attached to star in a remake of another 90s hit, the Ron Howard firefighter film Backdraft. Featuring an ensemble cast which included the likes of Kurt Russell, William Baldwin, Robert De Niro, and the late Donald Sutherland, Backdraft was an unexpected hit in 1991, earning $152 million at the box office and three Oscar nominations.\n\nAppearing on CNBC to talk about the current state of Hollywood, Grazer - who has been in the business for more than 40 years and seen it all - was asked if people were really going back to the movies the same way they were pre-COVID. It was during his answer that Grazer slipped in the fact that not only is Backdraft in the works with Glen Powell attached to star, but also a movie based on his popular hit series from the early aughts that starred Kiefer Sutherland, 24.\n\n\"Imagine [Entertainment] has always played in that zone where there is that chance, high probability of chance, that it [a movie] will be successful in a movie theater. It's great for us because we've built, over 30 years, over 100 different products - brands. Whether it's Backdraft which I'm now going to do today with Glen Powell, or whether it's 24, a movie that we're going to do in a very interesting way with Disney-Fox.\"\n\nBackdraft R Release Date May 24, 1991 Director Ron Howard Cast Kurt Russell , William Baldwin , Robert De Niro , Donald Sutherland , Jennifer Jason Leigh , Scott Glenn Main Genre Action\n\nHe would go on to explain the simple reasoning these days for streaming services and big studios to rely heavily on established brands to bring in audiences, rather than take a chance on new material which might not be as successful compared to something like a Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F, or Barbie, which had brand awareness for more than 60 years before the Margot Robbie film became the smash hit of 2023.\n\n\"These formats of the late 90s, early 2000s have become very important because the streamers, or studios, are right now even more risk-averse. They like brands that are already established that people have a high level of awareness to, where you actually add a new twist, or really interesting casting, which is of course what we're doing with ours. We're doing something with Sidney Sweeny which I'm very excited about. We're doing something with Scarlett Johansson, also very excited about that. I mentioned Glen Powell with Backdraft.\"\n\nAI and Digital Effects Could Lead to Backdraft Becoming a Hit Today Close\n\nWhile Backdraft featured a mix of real flames combined with stunning visual effects in 1991 courtesy of Industrial Light & Magic, Grazer touched on the fact that in today's world those effects could be even more impressive thanks to the advancement of AI and digital technology. When asked if the movie about a heroic band of firefighters would have the same success in 2024 as an original picture, Grazer didn't hesitate to say that it would, due in part to the tools that the filmmakers of the 21st century have at their disposal which weren't around 35 years ago.\n\n\"I think so, yes. AI and digital effects have so far advanced themselves that you can have tiny little cameras, almost imperceptible, that will capture the physics of a fire in a way that's never been done before...Those are the advancements and benefits of AI and digital effects.\"\n\nRelated Glen Powell Tapped to Star in Edgar Wright's Adaptation of Stephen King's The Running Man\n\nThe Anything But You star has signed on to star in Paramount's reboot of the 1987 Arnold Schwarzenegger cult-classic.\n\nWhile no official word from any particular studio has come down that either a remake or legacy sequel to Backdraft is officially on the table with Powell tapped to star, with the weight of Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, and Imagine Entertainment behind the idea, there's a high probability that audiences will one again be taken into the fire at some point in the near future. We'll have more news on Backdraft and a potential 24 movie as details become available.\n\nBackdraft is currently available to rent or purchase on all VOD platforms.", "source": {"uri":

NME has reached out to 20th Century Studios for comment.\n\nLast month, Donald Sutherland, father of Kiefer, died aged 88.\n\nWith a career dating back to the 1950s, Donald was widely regarded as one of the most versatile and respected actors in Hollywood, winning numerous prestigious awards for his work in both film and television.\n\nKiefer announced the new on X (June 20). The statement read: \"With a heavy heart I tell you that my father, Donald Sutherland, has passed away. I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film.\n\n\"Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly,\" he continued. \"He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.\"\n\nIn 2017, Donald received an Honorary Oscar \"for a lifetime of indelible character, rendered with unwavering truthfulness.\" He was survived by his wife and five children, who include Kiefer, the actor Rossif Sutherland and the producer Angus Sutherland.", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and

That means there is no word as of yet on whether Sutherland will return as counterterrorism agent Jack Bauer.\n\nSutherland played Bauer across all eight seasons of the show's original run on Fox, which aired from 2001 to 2014, and the television film 24: Redemption, which aired between Seasons 6 and 7. He also reprised the role for the limited event spinoff series 24: Live Another Day in 2014.\n\nThe show won multiple Primetime Emmys across its run, including Outstanding Drama Series and Outstanding Lead Actor for Sutherland in 2006. Sutherland also won a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Drama Series in 2001.\n\nMore from this section Lip Reader Reveals Trump's Stunning Exclamation After Shooting Keira Knightley's pasta obsession: The comfort food she can't resist!

It was an incredible experience,\" Sutherland told GQ Magazine in a 2022 interview. \"I have learned that you're just better off not to be definitive about your answer of whether you will do something or not do something. I love playing that character. I do believe the story is unresolved.\"\n\nHe continued, \"If something were to be written that made sense to me and that I thought was going to contribute to the franchise then I would be behind it, even if my participation in that were to be limited.\"\n\nSutherland most recently starred in the Paramount+ spy thriller Rabbit Hole, where he played a private espionage agent framed for murder.

He last played the character in the 24 event series, also known as 24: Live Another Day, which aired on Fox in 2014.\n\nImagine Entertainment co-founder Brian Grazer let slip about the project on MSNBC's Squawk Box in June, on which he also revealed that a Backdraft reboot is in the works with Glen Powell.\n\n\"Imagine has always played in that zone where there is that high probability chance that it will be successful in movie theaters,\" Grazer stated. \"It's great for us because we've built, over 30 years, over 100 different products and brands, whether it's Backdraft, which I'm now going to do today with Glen Powell, or whether it's 24, a movie that we're going to do in a very interesting way with Disney and Fox.\"\n\nRumors of a 24 continuation or spin-off have swirled for years. Fox was said to be planning some offshoots from the flagship series in 2018, including a prequel with a young Jack Bauer, but that idea was scrapped two years later. The network returned to the drawing board in 2021, actively discussing how to bring 24 back.\n\nSutherland then revealed in 2022 that he would be open to playing Bauer again if all the cards fell into place, especially since he feels his character's story on 24 remains somewhat \"unresolved.\"\n\nThe original series ran for nine seasons, most of which consisted of 24 episodes to cover 24 hours of events in real-time. The series premiered on Fox in 2001 and aired its final episode when Season 8 concluded in 2010. Sutherland returned as Bauer in 2014 for 24: Live Another Day, with a story told across 12 episodes.\n\nFox also tried a spin-off titled 24: Legacy, which premiered in 2017. Sutherland executive-produced the series but did not reprise his role as Bauer. Instead, Corey Hawkins led the show as an ex-Army Ranger named Eric Carter. It only lasted one season, though Fox later shared plans to develop a new incarnation of 24.", "source": {"uri": "ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Grazer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brian Grazer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Bauer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jack Bauer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "20th Century Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glen Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Backdraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Imagine Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reboot (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_theater", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Movie theater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Hawkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corey Hawkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_time_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real time (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24:_Legacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "24: Legacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Rangers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Army Rangers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/18/24-movie-in-early-development-1721296791974.jpg?width=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742421", "eventUri": "eng-9742421", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

The original show starred Kiefer Sutherland as no-nonsense US counter-terrorist federal agent Jack Bauer, and reports have revealed that a new adventure is now \"in early development\" courtesy of 20th Century Studios.\n\nAs per Variety, it is currently unknown whether the movie adaptation of 24 will bring back Bauer for more, or whether it will focus on a new cast of characters. However, according to Imagine Entertainment co-founder Brian Grazer (who was an executive producer on the original series), the studio believes there is potential for huge success by putting 24 on the big screen.\n\n\"Imagine has always played in that zone where there is that high probability chance that it will be successful in movie theaters. It's great for us, because we've built, over 30 years, over 100 different products and brands, whether it's 'Backdraft,' which I'm now going to do today with Glen Powell, or whether it's '24,' a movie that we're going to do in a very interesting way with Disney and Fox.\"\n\nRelated The 20 Greatest Action TV Series of All Time\n\nThese are the best of the best in terms of action shows out of the many different eras of television.\n\nAs well as teasing a Backdraft remake led by Twisters star Glen Powell, Grazer teases the 24 movie as something \"very interesting.\" The push to launch a new 24 project in theaters comes as part of Grazer's desire to capitalize on \"already established\" franchises and fanbases. Which is, of course, something that is now happening across Hollywood studios as they attempt to tap into audiences' nostalgia.\n\n\"These formats of the late 90s and the 2000s have become very important, because the streamers...or studios are very, right now, even more of risk averse.\"\n\n24 Is Now Considered One of the Best TV Shows of All Time Close\n\nCreated by Joel Surnow and Robert Cochran for Fox, 24 first began back in 2001 and follows Sutherland as the now iconic Counter Terrorist Unit agent, Jack Bauer. The show followed Bauer and his team as they attempt to thwart multiple terrorist plots to protect innocent people. But the real hook of the show was that everything happens in \"real time\" over 24 hours, which was emphasized by a digital countdown that would pop up throughout each episode.\n\nOriginally running for nine seasons, 24 has been brought back multiple times over the years for the TV movie 24: Redemption, the limited series 24: Live Another Day, and a spinoff titled 24: Legacy. The series was a huge pop culture hit, and won a series of awards and nominations, including at the Golden Globes and Emmy Awards. However, while 24 was largely met with critical acclaim throughout its run, accusations of Islamophobia and glorification and justification of the use of torture have since been leveled at the show. Something which any new project in the franchise would likely need to address.\n\nSutherland, meanwhile, has become synonymous with the grizzled, violent Jack Bauer, and while his involvement in the new movie is unknown, the actor did reveal last year that he keeps in touch with 24 showrunner Howard Gordon, and would \"jump\" at the chance to return.\n\n24 is available to stream on Disney+.",

It is allegedly in early development at 20th Century.\n\nSources for Variety have confirmed the news, with Imagine Entertainment co-founder Grazer previously teasing the project on MSNBC's Squawk Box last month. There he said, \"Imagine has always played in that zone where there is that high probability chance that it will be successful in movie theaters. It's great for us, because we've built, over 30 years, over 100 different products and brands, whether it's 'Backdraft,' which I'm now going to do today with Glen Powell, or whether it's '24,' a movie that we're going to do in a very interesting way with Disney and Fox.\"\n\nThere are currently no plot details for the movie, and it is not known if it will be a continuation of the series or a reboot.\n\n24 Film continues the legacy of a hit show\n\n24 saw a Counter Terrorist Unit agent attempt to thwart various terrorist attacks in a real-time 24-hour season (taking ad breaks into account).\n\nA 24 movie would resurrect the hit Fox series for a whole new audience while obviously trying to draw in fans of the show. But surely, it would need its key component.\n\nThe 24 TV show ran for nine seasons between 2001 and 2014, earning 68 Emmy nominations and 20 wins along the way. Among those wins were accolades for lead actor Kiefer Sutherland, who played CTU agent Jack Bauer. There's currently no news on Sutherland's involvement in the 24 movie.\n\nCanadian actor Sutherland is now 57, so it seems a little less likely he'd return in an action-heavy way, but 24 would be a tough sell without Jack Bauer.\n\nIn 2016, Fox attempted just that with 24: Legacy, which saw Corey Hawkins become the new protagonist of the format. Sutherland declined a return at the time due to filming Designated Survivor, but 24 regular Carlos Bernard did return as Tony Almeida. Unfortunately, the revival only lasted for a single season.", "source": {"uri": "comingsoon.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "ComingSoon.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neil_bolt@comingsoon.net", "name": "Neil Bolt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Grazer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brian Grazer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Imagine Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glen Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_time_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real time (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reboot (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Hawkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corey Hawkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_Survivor_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Designated Survivor (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Bernard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Bernard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24:_Legacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "24: Legacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Almeida", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Almeida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Bauer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Bauer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiefer_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kiefer Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/24-movie-brian-grazer-20th-century.jpg?resize=1200,630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742421", "eventUri": "eng-9742421", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

It is not known if Sutherland will be playing the main character in the upcoming picture or whether or not Sutherland will appear in the film version at all.\n\nThe hit series played for nine seasons during the time period of 2001-2014. In the show, Sutherland portrayed the wise agent Jack Bauer who worked for the government's \"Counter Terrorist Unit.\" Other big name stars who were featured on the program over the years, included Elisha Cuthbert, Sarah Clarke, Reiko Aylesworth and Dennis Haysbert.\n\nKiefer Sutherland received countless accolades for his work as Jack Bauer over the years in which he played him. Sutherland had a very famous film career with his most notable movie part to date being his turn as a vicious vampire in the 1987 horror hit classic, The Lost Boys.\n\nElisha Cuthbert has the most prolific movie career of the show's co-stars. She appeared in movies like The Quiet, The Girl Next Door and House of Wax. Although those films weren't all blockbusters, the hit The Girl Next Door garnered the actress many fans over the years.\n\nConsequently, it was also recently revealed by Imagine Entertainment co-founder, Brian Grazer, that a reboot of the 1991 movie, Backdraft, is also in the works. That film is set to star Glen Powell in the role made famous by the legendary Kurt Russell. Ron Howard directed the original movie which had an all-star cast that included William Baldwin, Kiefer's dad, Donald Sutherland and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Besides Powell's involvement, little else is known about that project at this time. A sequel to Backdraft bombed badly but was barely released and the new reboot will definitely have a larger budget and better production values. Glen Powell can be seen in the movie Twisters which opens this coming weekend.\n\nWhat made 24 such a hit show was its surprising action sequences and its terrific sense of unpredictability. Kiefer Sutherland ran with his characterization of Bauer and kept the intensity of his character intact during the duration of the show's run. Whoever stars in the upcoming feature film version will have a great property to work with. A TV movie based on the hit series which was called Redemption was made in 2008. People are hoping Kiefer Sutherland will play some part in the movie which is on the horizon. Look for more news on this project as it develops.", "source": {"uri": "film-book.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FilmBook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiefer_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kiefer Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Bauer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jack Bauer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisha_Cuthbert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elisha Cuthbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glen Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reiko_Aylesworth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reiko Aylesworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Clarke", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Clarke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imagine Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Grazer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Grazer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Haysbert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dennis Haysbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vampire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reboot (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Jason_Leigh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Jason Leigh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Howard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron Howard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feature film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kurt Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Television film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://film-book.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Kiefer-Sutherland-gun-24-01-700x400-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742421", "eventUri": "eng-9742421", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

In the clip, Grazer indicated he's working on a remake of 1991 firefighting drama \"Backdraft\".\n\nIn addition, he indicates that man-of-the-moment Glen Powell is at least considering it. It's certainly on Grazer's mind as he brings the film up twice in a four-minute interview.\n\nPowell, the 35-year-old \"Hit Man\" and \"Top Gun: Maverick\" actor who has \"Twisters\" opening in cinemas this weekend, has made no mention of \"Backdraft\" in pre-release interviews for that film.\n\nThus it's likely still very much in early development even if he does get onboard.

I literally had dreams about it.'\n\n@PT_gallagher recalled: 'Sick! It was appointment viewing with my group of friends, alternating whose house to watch every week.'\n\n@jmckinney2323 also said: 'Lol that's awesome. One of the best tv shows all time imo.'\n\nLast month, 24's production company Imagine Entertainment co-founder's Brian Grazer teased the possibility of a blockbuster film for 24.\n\nAppearing on MSNBC's Squawk Box, he said: 'Imagine has always played in that zone where there is that high probability chance that it will be successful in movie theaters.\n\n'It's great for us, because we've built, over 30 years, over 100 different products and brands, whether it's Backdraft, which I'm now going to do today with Glen Powell, or whether it's 24, a movie that we're going to do in a very interesting way with Disney and Fox.'\n\nBrian pointed out that Hollywood is currently looking towards 'already established' IP with 'a high level of awareness,' meaning classic properties 'from the late 90s and the 2000s' are now 'very important' to studios.\n\nIn 2022, Kiefer, 57, teased a 24 reboot to Metro.co.uk and said he would 'jump at the opportunity' to revisit Bauer.\n\nHe said: 'I've always said I love playing the character and I love the show. And if someone were to write something that I thought was really exciting, I would jump at the opportunity to do that.\n\n'If someone's gonna write it, they'd better write it quick, otherwise Jack Bauer is gonna have a cane and a bad back and all kinds of other crap.'\n\nHe chatted to Metro.co.uk more recently about more 24 and said cryptically: 'One of two things is going to have to happen in the show that they didn't let us do in the last one. So we'll see what happens if we get to go again.'\n\nKiefer also reminisced about his time on the show and said there 'wasn't a downside' and that it was the 'closest' he had to a 'normal' job.\n\nHe explained: 'I love the character. And I love the show. And I love the people that I got to make it with. So there wasn't a downside.'\n\nKiefer continued: 'My daughter was 12 when I started 24. And I have a picture of her in a cap and gown from NYU University at the end of the show. So it was a long period of time. But I was home, right? I had the closest thing I've ever had to a regular job.'\n\n24 was nominated for 68 Emmy Awards during its run and earned 20 wins including outstanding drama series and a lead actor prize for Kiefer in 2006.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted 20th Century Studios for comment.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us

Details are scarce at this early stage. The original 2001 series followed Bauer's attempts to prevent terrorist attacks on US soil within 24 hours in real-time. The new Imagine Entertainment movie based on 24 is in the works, with the plot details still unknown. All episodes stream on Hulu.\n\nJack Bauer might return to the screen soon, with the news that a new 24 movie is in the works at 20th Century and Imagine Entertainment. Deadline reports that the film is in the very early stages, so many details are not yet available. 24 started with the 2001 series starring Kiefer Sutherland as Bauer, a law enforcement agent at the fictional Counter Terrorism Unit. The series followed his attempts to thwart several attacks on US soil. The series would birth a movie and a spinoff later.\n\nAt this point, it is unclear where the movie is headed or who is returning. The 2008 film titled Redemption was made for television and aired on Fox. During an interview with CNBC, Imaginary Entertainment executive and co-founder Brian Grazer had hinted at the new movie. He talked about building recognizable brands and how advantaged his company had been to have over three decades of recognizable products. He revealed two movies in the works, saying,\n\n\"We've built over 30 years ... over 100 different products ... brands. Whether it's Backdraft , which I'm gonna do today with Glen Powell . Or whether it's 24 -- a movie that we're gonna do in a very interesting way with Disney ... Fox.\"\n\nWhat Is '24' About?\n\nThe series started in 2001 and follows Bauer as he tries to piece together clues and prevent terrorist attacks on citizens and government officials. Events in every episode are set within one hour, and the season unfolds in real-time, covering twenty-four hours. The series premiere was delayed after the September 11 terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers. It was a hit when it premiered on November 6. 24 ran for nine seasons and concluded in 2014.\n\nIn 2017, Fox revived the series. 24: Legacy premiered on February 5, 2017, and aired 12 episodes before being canceled. The series failed to attract an audience like its predecessor, partly because the new CTU agent, Eric Carter, played by Corey Hawkins, was not Bauer.

In a discussion of different legacy IP brands at his production company Imagine Entertainment, Grazer mentioned a 24 movie in the works \"that we're going to do in a very interesting way with Disney and Fox.\"\n\nThe project is still in the very early stages, though, so there's no word yet if Keifer Sutherland will return to reprise his role as counterterrorism agent Jack Bauer in the film. Sutherland starred as Bauer during 24's original run, which aired for eight seasons on Fox beginning in 2001. The real-time thriller became a hit and won a number of awards, including Emmys for best drama series and for Sutherland as best lead actor in a drama. Sutherland returned as Bauer for the limited series 24: Live Another Day, which aired in 2014. Fox also tried a spinoff, 24: Legacy, in 2017 -- with Corey Hawkins taking over the lead role -- but that was scrapped after a single season.\n\nThe way I see if - and, as a longtime fan of both the show and Sutherland - is that if Keifer is not there, it's not worth doing.

The movie adaptation aims to capture 24 's intense storytelling in a condensed format more suitable for modern viewers. There is uncertainty about Sutherland's return as Bauer, but the actor's enthusiasm for reprising his role is evident in past interviews.\n\n20th Century is currently developing a movie remake of Kiefer Sutherland's 24. Premiering in 2001 on Fox, the action-drama thriller follows Sutherland's Jack Bauer -- a US counter-terrorist federal agent, as he navigates various crises in the span of just one day. Running for 9 seasons with over 200 episodes, 24 also got a television film, 24: Redemption, as well as the shortlived spinoff, 24: Legacy, which starred war hero and ex-United States Army Ranger Sergeant Eric Carter, played by Corey Hawkins. Now, the franchise attempts to live on via a big screen adaptation.\n\nA new report from Variety reveals that 20th Century is currently working on a movie treatment for 24. Previously, Imagine Entertainment co-founder Brian Grazer teased the possibility of the famed series becoming a feature, saying they are going to approach it in a very interesting way. The outlet claims that it's still very much in the process, so there's no word yet on the plot for the project. It's also currently uncertain if Sutherland is coming back to reprise the lead role as Bauer.\n\nWhy 24's Iconic Format Will Work Better In Movies 20th Century May Have A New Franchise In Their Hands Close\n\nWhile 24's format was great with extended storytelling, having to go through several episodes across several months of broadcast can be incredibly frustrating for modern viewers who are mostly used to the bingeing method.\n\nThroughout the years, there have been reports about Fox wanting to continue the 24 franchise via multiple new endeavors. There were talks about more spinoffs and even a proper movie. Clearly, none of this has happened, and it's due to various reasons. It's still too early to tell if the new efforts will amount to something, considering the lack of confirmed details. But for now, the idea of fully transitioning 24 to the big screen sounds like a great idea because its signature style can work so much better in a shorter format.\n\nRelated 10 Best TV Shows Like 24\n\nMany political thrillers like 24 are well led and have a shared appeal to them for their tense action sequences and and gripping drama narratives.\n\n6\n\nInstead of a whole season, the 24-hour span could happen in a two-hour movie. While 24's format was great with extended storytelling, having to go through several episodes across several months of broadcast can be incredibly frustrating for modern viewers who are mostly used to the bingeing method. Meanwhile, dropping a full season at once takes away some of the tension that the narrative brings, since the rest of the year can be readily available on streaming. Shifting to a movie model allows the 20th Century to have the best of both worlds, while also birthing a new franchise.\n\nThe big question now is if Sutherland will return as Bauer in the new 24 movie. Multiple times in the past, the actor has expressed his desire to reprise the role and continue the famed thriller franchise. He's still so invested in the character that Sutherland really doesn't care if it's going to be on the small or big screen, just as long as he can step back into his famous character's shoes again.", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Bauer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jack Bauer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Remake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiefer_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kiefer Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterterrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Counterterrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24:_Legacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "24: Legacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Rangers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army Rangers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Special agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Television film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Hawkins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corey Hawkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imagine Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Grazer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Grazer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_thriller", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political thriller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/24-sreies.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742421", "eventUri": "eng-9742421", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

Most notably, a two-hour TV movie titled 24: Redemption aired between seasons 6 and 7 as a way to bridge the year-long delay during the 2007-08 Writer's Guild of America strike.\n\nWhenever rumors of a 24 movie have surfaced, questions soon followed about its format, since a two-hour window doesn't exactly lend itself to a real-time story. 24: Redemption was able to build its story around a real-time, two-hour crisis taking place simultaneously in the United States and the fictional country of Sangala. The series used 12-hour time jumps, however, in its final season, 24: Live Another Day, and in the 2017 spinoff series 24: Legacy, to account for a half-length season. It's possible that a 24 movie could do something similar.\n\nDuring its original run, 24 was known for its unpredictable twists, relentlessly killing off key characters and cliffhangers that always conveniently took place in the 59th minute of the hour.\n\nIt also faced controversy, both for its depiction of torture and its portrayal of the Islamic community. The series premiere was originally delayed due to 9/11, and the show's prime years occurred while Islamophobia and torture were both hot-button political issues in the United States.\n\nAs the 24 movie's development continues, speculation is sure to arise about a potential cast. In addition to Sutherland, 24 starred Mary Lynn Rajskub as Chloe O'Brian. She had the longest continuous run as a regular on the show after Sutherland, joining the cast in season 3. Carlos Bernard reprised his role as Tony Almeida for an appearance in 24: Legacy -- the only character from the main franchise to appear.", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "russell_steinberg@usmagazine.com", "name": "Russell Steinberg", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glen Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_time_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real time (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Backdraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feature film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_theater", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Movie theater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2023 Writers Guild of America strike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Bernard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Bernard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24:_Legacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "24: Legacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloe_O'Brian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chloe O'Brian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Lynn_Rajskub", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mary Lynn Rajskub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Almeida", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Almeida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Television pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliffhanger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cliffhanger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/24-Movie-in-Early-Development-But-Will-Kiefer-Sutherland-Return.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742421", "eventUri": "eng-9742421", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Deadline reports that the beloved Fox series is already on the road to a new motion picture in early development. Joel Surnow and Robert Cochran launched a massive hit on the network with Kiefer Sutherland as Jack Bauer. After premiering in 2001, audiences from all over the world tuned-in for this week's high-stakes action with the imagined \"Counter Terrorist Unit.\" Now, Imagine's Brian Glazer has hinted at the big-screen aspirations for 24 this week. And, we have confirmation from this report. No word on if Sutherland will reprise his role. But, he did tell EW that he's thought about it since starting Rabbit Hole on Paramount+.\n\n\"I mean, it was the best time of my life,\" Sutherland recalled. \"I was in my early 30s, so I was physically capable. I was not in my 20s, so I was a little smarter - not a whole lot, but a little smarter. And I got to do it for 10 years, which is, I guarantee you, the most stable opportunity that an actor will ever be given. So for all of those reasons, and just the fantastic people that I got to make it with - and by the way, it's so nice to do something that people like. [Laughs] Because I've had the other side, where I've done a few things where people are like, 'Yeah, that sucks.' I guarantee you the other version is nicer. It was incredibly special for me and I would like to see it continue on.\"\n\n\"Howard and I talk all the time and invariably it comes up,\" he added. \"The idea of him being brought back - I'm just spitballing - I think that's an interesting idea. You introduce a new cast of people in their effort to get him out, and it lives on from that point. There's a lot of ways to go about it.\"\n\nHow Will 24 Continue After This?\n\nEven if a direct 24 sequel wasn't on the way, Sutherland and the creative team had that around the idea of using the unique concept again. After all there's 20 for four hours in a day for all sorts of people and different walks of life. Who's to say that audiences wouldn't follow another type of emergency worker through harrowing situations that leave you at the edge of your seat winning more every week. In the same EW piece, he even tossed out some ideas.\n\n\"I also think it's such a great idea to take a 24-hour moment in somebody's life that is desperate - and that could be a fireman; that could be so many different circumstances,\" the star mused. \"It boggles my mind that someone hasn't come along and said, 'Well, we need to do this with it.' So whether it involves me or not, I just think that to do something in real time is so clever - difficult, but clever - that I find it kind of shocking that it hasn't manifested itself into something else and/or bigger.\"\n\nAre you down for another 24 project?

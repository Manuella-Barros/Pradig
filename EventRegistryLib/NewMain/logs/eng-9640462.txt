US Fed Chair Powell will announce the interest rate decision at 2:00 pm ET (or 11:30 pm as per Indian time), to be followed by his press conference. Investors are keenly looking for any indication of the timeline for the rate cuts.\n\nThe market is divided on whether the US Fed would cut rates once or twice this year after a strong US labour report. So, the attention will be on policymakers' updated economic projections and Chair Jerome Powell's press conference.\n\nUS Fed Meeting: Key Things to Watch Out For\n\nIt is also to be seen whether Powell's tone will continue to be hawkish or shift to be a dovish one. Investors also await the 'dot plot' in today's Summary of Economic Projections.\n\nSuman Bannerjee, CIO of Hedonova, said, \"The upcoming Fed meeting is crucial as it will likely maintain the fed funds rate target range of 5.25% to 5.5%, its highest since 2001, amidst efforts to control inflation without triggering a recession. Key aspects include updates on the pace of balance sheet runoff and economic projections, particularly for GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation.\"\n\nInvestors will scrutinize the Fed's stance on future rate cuts, especially given mixed inflation data and economic slowdown signs. The May jobs report and upcoming inflation data will also heavily influence the Fed's decisions and economic outlook, he added.\n\nWhen to Expect the Start of the Fed Rate Cut Cycle\n\nAccording to the bond market, investors are potentially anticipating the first Fed rate cut at the September 2024 meeting, with a 47.6% probability. The likelihood of at least two rate cuts by the end of the year is also significant, at 36.9%. However, this timeline is contingent on continued positive inflation data and economic conditions. Persistent sticky inflation and economic growth indicators will play a crucial role in determining the exact timing of rate cuts, with the Fed needing to balance inflation control with economic stability.\n\nUS Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday will also likely make official what's been clear for many weeks: With inflation sticking at a level above their 2 per cent target, they are downgrading their outlook for interest rate cuts.\n\nIn a set of quarterly economic forecasts they will issue after their latest meeting ends, the policymakers are expected to project that they will cut their benchmark rate just once or twice by year's end, rather than the three times they had envisioned in March.\n\nThe Fed's rate policies typically have a significant impact on the costs of mortgages, auto loans, credit card rates and other forms of consumer and business borrowing.

In large part, that's because prices remain much higher than they were before the pandemic struck. High borrowing rates impose a further financial burden.\n\nThe Fed's updated economic forecasts, which it will issue Wednesday afternoon, will likely be influenced by the government's May inflation data being released in the morning. The inflation report is expected to show that consumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs -- so-called core inflation -- rose 0.3% from April to May. That would be the same as in the previous month and higher than Fed officials would prefer to see.\n\nOverall inflation, held down by falling gas prices, is thought to have edged up just 0.1%. Measured from a year earlier, consumer prices are projected to have risen 3.4% in May, the same as in April.\n\nInflation had fallen steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could achieve a \"soft landing,\" whereby it would manage to conquer inflation through rate hikes without causing a recession.

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday will likely make official what's been clear for many weeks: With inflation sticking at a level above their 2% target, they're downgrading their outlook for interest rate cuts.\n\nIn a set of quarterly economic forecasts they will issue after their latest meeting ends, the policymakers are expected to project that they will cut their benchmark rate twice by year's end, rather than the three times they had envisioned in March.\n\nThe Fed's updated economic forecasts, which it will issue Wednesday afternoon, will likely be influenced by the government's May inflation data, released Wednesday morning. That report showed that inflation cooled unexpectedly. Overall prices were unchanged from April to May. And so-called core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, rose just 0.2%, the smallest monthly rise since October.\n\nMeasured from a year earlier, consumer prices rose 3.3% in May, down from 3.4% the previous month. Year-over-year core inflation slowed from 3.6% in April to 3.4% in May, the mildest annual pace in three years.\n\nThe Fed's rate policies typically have a significant impact on the costs of mortgages, auto loans, credit card rates and other forms of consumer and business borrowing. The downgrade in their outlook for rate cuts would mean that such borrowing costs would likely stay higher for longer, a disappointment for potential homebuyers and others.\n\nStill, the Fed's quarterly projections of future interest rate cuts are by no means fixed in time. The policymakers frequently revise their plans for rate cuts -- or hikes -- depending on how economic growth and inflation measures evolve over time.\n\nBut if borrowing costs remain high in the coming months, they could also have consequences for the presidential race. Though the unemployment rate is a low 4%, hiring is robust and consumers continue to spend, voters have taken a generally sour view of the economy under President Joe Biden. In large part, that's because prices remain much higher than they were before the pandemic struck. High borrowing rates impose a further financial burden.\n\nInflation had fallen steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could achieve a \"soft landing,\" whereby it would manage to conquer inflation through rate hikes without causing a recession. Such an outcome is difficult and rare.\n\nBut inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and potentially imperiling a soft landing.\n\nIn early May, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its target before it would reduce its benchmark rate. Powell noted that it would likely take more time to gain that confidence than Fed officials had previously thought.\n\nLast month, Christopher Waller, an influential member of the Fed's Board of Governors, said he needed to see \"several more months of good inflation data\" before he would consider supporting rate cuts. Though Waller didn't spell out what would constitute good data, economists think it would have to be core inflation of 0.2% or less each month.\n\nPowell and other Fed policymakers have also said that as long as the economy stays healthy, they see no need to cut rates soon.\n\n\"Fed officials have clearly signaled that they are in a wait-and-see mode with respect to the timing and magnitude of rate cuts,\" Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to clients.\n\nThe Fed's approach to its rate policies relies heavily on the latest turn in economic data. In the past, the central bank would have put more weight on where it envisioned inflation and economic growth in the coming months.\n\nYet now, \"they don't have any confidence in their ability to forecast inflation,\" said Nathan Sheets, chief global economist at Citi and a former top economist at the Fed.\n\n\"No one,\" Sheets said, \"has been successful at forecasting inflation\" for the past three to four years.", "source": {"uri": "wivb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "wivb4"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Waller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Waller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Board_of_Governors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Board of Governors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.wivb.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/97/2024/06/powelljerome_092023getty_fed.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 693, "textEnd": 698}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

That is a more positive assessment than after the Fed's previous meeting May 1, when the officials had said there had been \"a lack of further progress\" on inflation.\n\nThe policymakers, as expected, kept their key rate unchanged Wednesday at roughly 5.3%. The benchmark rate has remained at that level since July of last year, after the Fed raised it 11 times to try to slow borrowing and spending and cool inflation. Fed rate cuts would, over time, lighten loan costs for consumers, who have faced punishingly high rates for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other forms of borrowing.\n\nThe officials' rate-cut forecast reflects the individual estimates of 19 policymakers.

Consumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs -- the closely watched \"core\" index -- rose just 0.2% from April, the smallest rise since October. Measured from a year earlier, core prices climbed 3.4%, the mildest pace in three years.\n\nThough inflation has tumbled from a peak of 9.1% two years ago, it remains too high for the Fed's liking. The policymakers now face the delicate task of keeping rates high enough to slow spending and defeat high inflation without derailing the economy.\n\nThe central bank's rate policies over the next several months could also have consequences for the presidential race.

Watch in the player above.\n\nThey are likely make official what's been clear for many weeks: With inflation sticking at a level above their 2% target, they are downgrading their outlook for interest rate cuts.\n\nIn a set of quarterly economic forecasts they will issue after their latest meeting ends, the policymakers are expected to project that they will cut their benchmark rate just once or twice by year's end, rather than the three times they had envisioned in March.\n\nThe Fed's rate policies typically have a significant impact on the costs of mortgages, auto loans, credit card rates and other forms of consumer and business borrowing. The downgrade in their outlook for rate cuts would mean that such borrowing costs would likely stay higher for longer, a disappointment for potential homebuyers and others.\n\nStill, the Fed's quarterly projections of future interest rate cuts are by no means fixed in time. The policymakers frequently revise their plans for rate cuts -- or hikes -- depending on how economic growth and inflation measures evolve over time.\n\nBut if borrowing costs remain high in the coming months, they could also have consequences for the presidential race. Though the unemployment rate is a low 4%, hiring is robust and consumers continue to spend, voters have taken a generally sour view of the economy under President Joe Biden. In large part, that's because prices remain much higher than they were before the pandemic struck. High borrowing rates impose a further financial burden.\n\nThe Fed's updated economic forecasts, which it will issue Wednesday afternoon, will likely be influenced by the government's May inflation data being released in the morning. The inflation report is expected to show that consumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs -- so-called core inflation -- rose 0.3% from April to May. That would be the same as in the previous month and higher than Fed officials would prefer to see.\n\nOverall inflation, held down by falling gas prices, is thought to have edged up just 0.1%. Measured from a year earlier, consumer prices are projected to have risen 3.4% in May, the same as in April.\n\nInflation had fallen steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could achieve a \"soft landing,\" whereby it would manage to conquer inflation through rate hikes without causing a recession. Such an outcome is difficult and rare.\n\nBut inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and potentially imperiling a soft landing.\n\nIn early May, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its target before it would reduce its benchmark rate. Powell noted that it would likely take more time to gain that confidence than Fed officials had previously thought.\n\nLast month, Christopher Waller, an influential member of the Fed's Board of Governors, said he needed to see \"several more months of good inflation data\" before he would consider supporting rate cuts.

On Wednesday, June 12, 2024, the Federal Reserve ends its latest meeting by issuing a policy statement, updating its economic and interest-rate projections and holding a news conference with Powell.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday will likely make official what's been clear for many weeks: With inflation sticking at a level above their 2% target, they are downgrading their outlook for interest rate cuts.\n\nIn a set of quarterly economic forecasts they will issue after their latest meeting ends, the policymakers are expected to project that they will cut their benchmark rate just once or twice by year's end, rather than the three times they had envisioned in March.\n\nThe Fed's rate policies typically have a significant impact on the costs of mortgages, auto loans, credit card rates and other forms of consumer and business borrowing. The downgrade in their outlook for rate cuts would mean that such borrowing costs would likely stay higher for longer, a disappointment for potential homebuyers and others.\n\nStill, the Fed's quarterly projections of future interest rate cuts are by no means fixed in time. The policymakers frequently revise their plans for rate cuts -- or hikes -- depending on how economic growth and inflation measures evolve over time.\n\nBut if borrowing costs remain high in the coming months, they could also have consequences for the presidential race. Though the unemployment rate is a low 4%, hiring is robust and consumers continue to spend, voters have taken a generally sour view of the economy under President Joe Biden. In large part, that's because prices remain much higher than they were before the pandemic struck. High borrowing rates impose a further financial burden.\n\nThe Fed's updated economic forecasts, which it will issue Wednesday afternoon, will likely be influenced by the government's May inflation data being released in the morning. The inflation report is expected to show that consumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs -- so-called core inflation -- rose 0.3% from April to May. That would be the same as in the previous month and higher than Fed officials would prefer to see.\n\nOverall inflation, held down by falling gas prices, is thought to have edged up just 0.1%. Measured from a year earlier, consumer prices are projected to have risen 3.4% in May, the same as in April.\n\nInflation had fallen steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could achieve a \"soft landing,\" whereby it would manage to conquer inflation through rate hikes without causing a recession. Such an outcome is difficult and rare.\n\nBut inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and potentially imperiling a soft landing.\n\nIn early May, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its target before it would reduce its benchmark rate. Powell noted that it would likely take more time to gain that confidence than Fed officials had previously thought.\n\nLast month, Christopher Waller, an influential member of the Fed's Board of Governors, said he needed to see \"several more months of good inflation data\" before he would consider supporting rate cuts. Though Waller didn't spell out what would constitute good data, economists think it would have to be core inflation of 0.2% or less each month.\n\nPowell and other Fed policymakers have also said that as long as the economy stays healthy, they see no need to cut rates soon.\n\n\"Fed officials have clearly signaled that they are in a wait-and-see mode with respect to the timing and magnitude of rate cuts,\" Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to clients.\n\nThe Fed's approach to its rate policies relies heavily on the latest turn in economic data. In the past, the central bank would have put more weight on where it envisioned inflation and economic growth in the coming months.\n\nYet now, \"they don't have any confidence in their ability to forecast inflation,\" said Nathan Sheets, chief global economist at Citi and a former top economist at the Fed.\n\n\"No one,\" Sheets said, \"has been successful at forecasting inflation\" for the past three to four years.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_rugaber@register-herald.com", "name": "Christopher Rugaber", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economic forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Board_of_Governors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Board of Governors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Waller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Waller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/register-herald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/7e/f7e3a51f-fb11-5a5b-a96d-870b28a2e131/66694d3b22f10.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-06-", "textStart": 146, "textEnd": 153}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

The policymakers' forecast for one rate cut was down from a previous forecast of three, likely because inflation, despite having cooled in the past two months, remains persistently elevated. In a statement issued after its two-day meeting, the Fed said the economy is growing at a solid pace while hiring has \"remained strong.\" The officials also noted that in recent months there has been \"modest further progress\" toward its 2% inflation target. That is a more positive assessment than after the Fed's previous meeting May 1, when the officials had said there had been \"a lack of further progress\" on inflation. The policymakers, as expected, kept their key rate unchanged Wednesday at roughly 5.3%. The benchmark rate has remained at that level since July of last year, after the Fed raised it 11 times to try to slow borrowing and spending and cool inflation. Fed rate cuts would, over time, lighten loan costs for consumers, who have faced punishingly high rates for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other forms of borrowing. The officials' rate-cut forecast reflects the individual estimates of 19 policymakers. The Fed said that eight of those officials projected two rate cuts and seven projected one cut.

That report showed that inflation cooled unexpectedly. Overall prices were unchanged from April to May. And so-called core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, rose just 0.2%, the smallest monthly rise since October.\n\nMeasured from a year earlier, consumer prices rose 3.3% in May, down from 3.4% the previous month. Year-over-year core inflation slowed from 3.6% in April to 3.4% in May, the mildest annual pace in three years.\n\nThe Fed's rate policies typically have a significant impact on the costs of mortgages, auto loans, credit card rates and other forms of consumer and business borrowing. The downgrade in their outlook for rate cuts would mean that such borrowing costs would likely stay higher for longer, a disappointment for potential homebuyers and others.\n\nStill, the Fed's quarterly projections of future interest rate cuts are by no means fixed in time. The policymakers frequently revise their plans for rate cuts -- or hikes -- depending on how economic growth and inflation measures evolve over time.\n\nBut if borrowing costs remain high in the coming months, they could also have consequences for the presidential race. Though the unemployment rate is a low 4%, hiring is robust and consumers continue to spend, voters have taken a generally sour view of the economy under President Joe Biden. In large part, that's because prices remain much higher than they were before the pandemic struck. High borrowing rates impose a further financial burden.\n\nInflation had fallen steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could achieve a \"soft landing,\" whereby it would manage to conquer inflation through rate hikes without causing a recession. Such an outcome is difficult and rare.\n\nBut inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and potentially imperiling a soft landing.\n\nIn early May, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its target before it would reduce its benchmark rate. Powell noted that it would likely take more time to gain that confidence than Fed officials had previously thought.\n\nLast month, Christopher Waller, an influential member of the Fed's Board of Governors, said he needed to see \"several more months of good inflation data\" before he would consider supporting rate cuts. Though Waller didn't spell out what would constitute good data, economists think it would have to be core inflation of 0.2% or less each month.\n\nPowell and other Fed policymakers have also said that as long as the economy stays healthy, they see no need to cut rates soon.\n\n\"Fed officials have clearly signaled that they are in a wait-and-see mode with respect to the timing and magnitude of rate cuts,\" Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to clients.\n\nThe Fed's approach to its rate policies relies heavily on the latest turn in economic data. In the past, the central bank would have put more weight on where it envisioned inflation and economic growth in the coming months.\n\nYet now, \"they don't have any confidence in their ability to forecast inflation,\" said Nathan Sheets, chief global economist at Citi and a former top economist at the Fed.\n\n\"No one,\" Sheets said, \"has been successful at forecasting inflation\" for the past three to four years.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@bostonherald.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economic forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Waller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Waller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Board_of_Governors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Board of Governors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24131732724722.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

That is a more positive assessment than after the Fed's previous meeting May 1, when the officials said there had been \"a lack of further progress\" on inflation.\n\nThe policymakers, as expected, kept their key rate unchanged at roughly 5.3%. The benchmark rate has remained at that level since July of last year, after the Fed raised it 11 times to try to slow borrowing and spending and cool inflation. Fed rate cuts would, over time, lighten loan costs for consumers, who have faced punishingly high rates for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other forms of borrowing.\n\nThe officials' rate-cut forecast reflects the individual estimates of 19 policymakers. The Fed said that eight of those officials projected two rate cuts and seven projected one cut. Four said they envisioned no cuts at all this year.\n\nThe Fed's updated quarterly projections are by no means fixed in time. The policymakers frequently revise their plans for rate cuts -- or hikes -- depending on how economic growth and inflation evolve over time.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the government reported that inflation eased in May for a second straight month, a hopeful sign that an acceleration of prices that occurred early this year may have passed. Consumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs -- the closely watched \"core\" index -- rose just 0.2% from April, the smallest rise since October. Measured from a year earlier, core prices climbed 3.4%, the mildest pace in three years.\n\nThough inflation has tumbled from a peak of 9.1% two years ago, it remains too high for the Fed's liking. The policymakers now face the delicate task of keeping rates high enough to slow spending and defeat high inflation without derailing the economy.\n\nThe central bank's rate policies over the next several months could also have consequences for the presidential race. Though the unemployment rate is a low 4%, hiring is robust and consumers continue to spend, voters have taken a generally sour view of the economy under President Joe Biden. In large part, that's because prices remain much higher than they were before the pandemic struck. High borrowing rates impose a further financial burden.\n\nInflation had cooled steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could achieve a rare \"soft landing,\" whereby it would manage to conquer inflation through rate hikes without causing a recession. But inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and potentially imperiling a soft landing.\n\nIn early May, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its target before it would reduce its benchmark rate. Powell noted that it would likely take more time to gain that confidence than Fed officials had previously thought.\n\nLast month, Christopher Waller, an influential member of the Fed's Board of Governors, said he needed to see \"several more months of good inflation data\" before he would consider supporting rate cuts. Though Waller didn't spell out what would constitute good data, economists think it would have to be core inflation of 0.2% or less each month.\n\nAs part of the updated quarterly forecasts the Fed's policymakers issued Wednesday, they projected that the economy will grow 2.1% this year and 2% in 2025, the same as they had envisioned in March. They expect core inflation to be 2.8% by year's end, according to their preferred gauge, up from a previous forecast of 2.6%. And they project that unemployment will stay at its current 4% rate by the end of this year and edge up to 4.2% by the end of 2025.", "source": {"uri": "trentonian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Trentonian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@trentonian.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Board_of_Governors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Board of Governors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Travel", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.trentonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Federal_Reserve_56550.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 749, "textEnd": 754}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

The benchmark rate has remained at that level since July of last year, after the Fed raised it 11 times to try to slow borrowing and spending and cool inflation. Fed rate cuts would, over time, lighten loan costs for consumers, who have faced punishingly high rates for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other forms of borrowing.\n\nThe officials' rate-cut forecast reflects the individual estimates of 19 policymakers.

The policymakers frequently revise their plans for rate cuts -- or hikes -- depending on how economic growth and inflation evolve over time.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the government reported that inflation eased in May for a second straight month, a hopeful sign that an acceleration of prices that occurred early this year may have passed. Consumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs -- the closely watched \"core\" index -- rose just 0.2% from April, the smallest rise since October. Measured from a year earlier, core prices climbed 3.4%, the mildest pace in three years.\n\n\"We welcome today's reading and hope for more like that,\" Powell said at his news conference.\n\nThough inflation has tumbled from a peak of 9.1% two years ago, it remains too high for the Fed's liking.

Here's what to expect - National | Globalnews.ca", "body": "Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday will likely make official what's been clear for many weeks: With inflation sticking at a level above their two per cent target, they're downgrading their outlook for interest rate cuts.\n\nIn a set of quarterly economic forecasts they will issue after their latest meeting ends, the policymakers are expected to project that they will cut their benchmark rate just once or twice by year's end, rather than the three times they had envisioned in March.\n\nThe Fed's updated economic forecasts, which it will issue Wednesday afternoon, will likely be influenced by the government's May inflation data, released Wednesday morning. That report showed that inflation cooled unexpectedly. Overall prices were unchanged from April to May. And so-called core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, rose just 0.2 per cent, the smallest monthly rise since October.\n\nMeasured from a year earlier, consumer prices rose 3.3 per cent in May, down from 3.4 per cent the previous month. Year-over-year core inflation slowed from 3.6 per cent in April to 3.4 per cent in May, the mildest annual pace in three years.\n\nThe Fed's rate policies typically have a significant impact on the costs of mortgages, auto loans, credit card rates and other forms of consumer and business borrowing.\n\nThe downgrade in their outlook for rate cuts would mean that such borrowing costs would likely stay higher for longer, a disappointment for potential homebuyers and others.\n\nStill, the Fed's quarterly projections of future interest rate cuts are by no means fixed in time. The policymakers frequently revise their plans for rate cuts -- or hikes -- depending on how economic growth and inflation measures evolve over time.\n\nBut if borrowing costs remain high in the coming months, they could also have consequences for the presidential race. Though the unemployment rate is a low four per cent, hiring is robust and consumers continue to spend, voters have taken a generally sour view of the economy under President Joe Biden. In large part, that's because prices remain much higher than they were before the pandemic struck. High borrowing rates impose a further financial burden.\n\nInflation had fallen steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could achieve a \"soft landing,\" whereby it would manage to conquer inflation through rate hikes without causing a recession. Such an outcome is difficult and rare.\n\nBut inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and potentially imperiling a soft landing.\n\nIn early May, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its target before it would reduce its benchmark rate.\n\nPowell noted that it would likely take more time to gain that confidence than Fed officials had previously thought.\n\nLast month, Christopher Waller, an influential member of the Fed's Board of Governors, said he needed to see \"several more months of good inflation data\" before he would consider supporting rate cuts. Though Waller didn't spell out what would constitute good data, economists think it would have to be core inflation of 0.2% or less each month.\n\nPowell and other Fed policymakers have also said that as long as the economy stays healthy, they see no need to cut rates soon.\n\n\"Fed officials have clearly signaled that they are in a wait-and-see mode with respect to the timing and magnitude of rate cuts,\" Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to clients.\n\nThe Fed's approach to its rate policies relies heavily on the latest turn in economic data. In the past, the central bank would have put more weight on where it envisioned inflation and economic growth in the coming months.\n\nYet now, \"they don't have any confidence in their ability to forecast inflation,\" said Nathan Sheets, chief global economist at Citi and a former top economist at the Fed.\n\n\"No one,\" Sheets said, \"has been successful at forecasting inflation\" for the past three to four years.", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economic forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Waller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Waller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Board_of_Governors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Board of Governors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240502160536-6633f93ea92a96f94f546a47jpeg.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The downgrade in their outlook for rate cuts would mean that such borrowing costs would likely stay higher for longer, a disappointment for potential homebuyers and others.\n\nStill, the Fed's quarterly projections of future interest rate cuts are by no means fixed in time. The policymakers frequently revise their plans for rate cuts -- or hikes -- depending on how economic growth and inflation measures evolve over time.\n\nAlso Read | Kuwait Building Fire: Indians Among 41 Killed in Apartment Blaze, Indian Embassy Issues Helpline Number (Watch Videos).\n\nBut if borrowing costs remain high in the coming months, they could also have consequences for the presidential race. Though the unemployment rate is a low 4 per cent, hiring is robust and consumers continue to spend, voters have taken a generally sour view of the economy under President Joe Biden. In large part, that's because prices remain much higher than they were before the pandemic struck. High borrowing rates impose a further financial burden.\n\nThe Fed's updated economic forecasts, which it will issue Wednesday afternoon, will likely be influenced by the government's May inflation data being released in the morning. The inflation report is expected to show that consumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs -- so-called core inflation -- rose 0.3 per cent from April to May. That would be the same as in the previous month and higher than Fed officials would prefer to see.\n\nOverall inflation, held down by falling gas prices, is thought to have edged up just 0.1 per cent. Measured from a year earlier, consumer prices are projected to have risen 3.4 per cent in May, the same as in April.\n\nInflation had fallen steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could achieve a \"soft landing,\" whereby it would manage to conquer inflation through rate hikes without causing a recession.\n\nSuch an outcome is difficult and rare.\n\nBut inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and potentially imperiling a soft landing.\n\nIn early May, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its target before it would reduce its benchmark rate. Powell noted that it would likely take more time to gain that confidence than Fed officials had previously thought.\n\nLast month, Christopher Waller, an influential member of the Fed's Board of Governors, said he needed to see \"several more months of good inflation data\" before he would consider supporting rate cuts. Though Waller didn't spell out what would constitute good data, economists think it would have to be core inflation of 0.2 per cent or less each month.\n\nPowell and other Fed policymakers have also said that as long as the economy stays healthy, they see no need to cut rates soon.\n\n\"Fed officials have clearly signaled that they are in a wait-and-see mode with respect to the timing and magnitude of rate cuts,\" Matthew Luzzetti, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to clients.\n\nThe Fed's approach to its rate policies relies heavily on the latest turn in economic data. In the past, the central bank would have put more weight on where it envisioned inflation and economic growth in the coming months.\n\nYet now, \"they don't have any confidence in their ability to forecast inflation,\" said Nathan Sheets, chief global economist at Citi and a former top economist at the Fed.\n\n\"No one,\" Sheets said, \"has been successful at forecasting inflation\" for the past three to four years.

Today, forecasters predict no rate cut before fall.\n\nHere's what to expect:\n\nWhat time is Fed meeting today?\n\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to announce its interest rate decision at 2 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday. Fed chair Jerome Powell will then hold a press conference at 2:30.\n\nInflation's sting: Will you become a more savvy shopper?\n\nPowell will likely talk about the decision and shed light on how the central bank views the overall economy. The market will look for clues in Powell's remarks to predict what rate actions the Fed might take the rest of the year.\n\nThe economy: At 3.3%, inflation remains too high for Fed. What economic data are saying, too\n\nCPI inflation data shows no real change\n\nThe May consumer price index (CPI) is out, coming just hours before the Fed's meeting ends, and new inflation data could influence the Fed's rate cut forecasts.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics released May's consumer price index Wednesday morning. For the month, inflation, as measured by the CPI, was unchanged when seasonally adjusted. The annual inflation rate fell slightly to 3.3%.\n\nThus, while inflation isn't spiking, the annual rate appears stuck above 3%. That's more than a full percentage point above where Fed officials want to see it, and another sign that borrowing costs will remain elevated.\n\nThe inflation report \"could influence the tone\" of the Fed meeting, wrote Deutsche Bank chief economist Matthew Luzzetti, in a note. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's \"comments on inflation will no doubt reflect the May CPI data released that morning.\"\n\nAlmost no one expects the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates when officials conclude their two-day meeting Wednesday. But economists and investors will be looking for clues about when the central bank finally might cut its key rate, and how many times it might do so this year.\n\nComing into the year, many economists predicted rates would already be falling.

The Fed said that eight of those officials projected two rate cuts and seven projected one cut. Four said they envisioned no cuts at all this year.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the government reported that inflation eased in May for a second straight month, a hopeful sign that an acceleration of prices that occurred earlier this year may have passed.\n\nConsumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs - the closely watched \"core\" index - rose just 0.2% from April, the smallest rise since October. Measured from a year earlier, core prices climbed 3.4%, the mildest pace in three years.\n\nThough inflation has tumbled from a peak of 9.1% two years ago, it remains too high for the Fed's liking. The policymakers now face the delicate task of keeping rates high enough to slow spending and defeat high inflation without derailing the economy.\n\nThe central bank's rate policies over the next several months could also have consequences for the presidential race.\n\nThough the unemployment rate is a low 4%, hiring is robust and consumers continue to spend, voters have taken a generally sour view of the economy under President Joe Biden. In large part, that is because prices remain much higher than they were before the pandemic struck. High borrowing rates impose a further financial burden.\n\nInflation had cooled steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could achieve a rare \"soft landing\", whereby it would manage to conquer inflation through rate hikes without causing a recession.\n\nBut inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and potentially imperilling a soft landing.\n\nAs part of the updated quarterly forecasts the Fed's policymakers issued on Wednesday, they projected that the economy will grow 2.1% this year and 2% in 2025, the same as they had envisioned in March.\n\nThey expect core inflation to be 2.8% by the year's end, according to their preferred gauge, up from a previous forecast of 2.6%. And they project that unemployment will stay at its current 4% rate by the end of this year and edge up to 4.2% by the end of 2025.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Travel", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://d3gvyx4eg3tne0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Img38278655.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

It does this by managing the federal funds rate, which influences borrowing costs for everything else in the economy.\n\nFor the past year, the Fed has held that rate at approximately 5.5%.\n\nBy keeping interest rates elevated, the Fed hopes to reduce consumer demand for goods and services -- and in turn slow price growth. When consumers find it easier to make purchases, businesses feel more comfortable raising prices.\n\nThe Fed's policy has resulted in APRs of more than 20% on most major credit cards, according to Bankrate, alongside mortgage and auto loan rates starting at 7%.\n\nThose higher rates may be working: Earlier Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 12-month inflation hit 3.3% in May, compared with 3.5% in April and lower than analysts' expectations.\n\nOn a monthly basis, inflation didn't rise at all, the first time that's happened since July 2022.\n\nFed officials have indicated they are in no rush yet to change the current rate level, hoping instead for continued progress on price growth.\n\n\"Many more months of positive inflation data, I think, to give me confidence that it's appropriate to dial back,\" Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, told CNBC last month in an interview when asked about what it would take for interest rates to come down.\n\nBut Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM accounting and consultancy group, said the slowing price-growth trend is likely to continue through the summer and could lead to a rate cut as soon as this fall.\n\n\"This should play into the Federal Reserve's forecast which points to a September rate cut as both the consumer price index and the personal consumer expenditure price index inch back towards the Fed's long term 2% inflation target,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. economy is showing signs of softening elsewhere, too.\n\nIn a note to clients, the chief international economist for the ING financial services group, James Knightley, said he believes the Fed could cut soon given softening inflation, rising unemployment -- now at 4% -- and slowing consumer spending.\n\n\"Today's outcome has boosted the chances of a September start point for rate cuts considerably,\" he wrote, referring to the Wednesday inflation report.\n\nThe Fed rate holds are coming at a time when it is facing some external pressure to cut. This week, three U.S. senators led by Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called on the Fed to lower rates because they are driving up housing and insurance costs.\n\nMeanwhile, Canada and the European Union also recently announced their own rate cuts.\n\nAs an independent central bank, the Fed is unlikely to be influenced directly by such outside pressures.\n\nInstead, Fed officials have uniformly asserted that their decisions are dependent on data.\n\nNow, that data is increasingly showing an economy that is no longer overheating.\n\n\"Fed officials ... will clearly welcome this slowing in inflation,\" economic analysts with Citi Research wrote Wednesday. \"We continue to expect the first rate cut in September and consecutive 25 (basis-point) cuts thereafter.\"", "source": {"uri":

Analysts predict minimal rate cuts this year, emphasizing uncertainty about future economic paths. Officials seek more consistent inflation data before adjusting policies, delaying potential rate reductions until at least September.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, with new economic projections from the U.S. central bank's policymakers likely to show fewer rate cuts this year and a delayed start to monetary policy easing.\n\nFed officials will receive a new round of inflation data that could shape their outlook just hours before they conclude their latest two-day meeting and release a fresh policy statement and updated quarterly projections. But with the Fed's efforts to lower inflation to its 2% target showing only modest improvement this year through April and strong job growth allaying concerns of a weakening economy, analysts expect the central bank to maintain its \"no-rush\" attitude towards rate cuts, leaving the benchmark policy rate in the 5.25%-5.50% range that was set last July.\n\n\"Given that inflation remains above target and activity remains robust, the Fed can exercise patience in determining when it would next adjust its policy rate,\" Bank of America economists wrote about a meeting they felt would see little change to the central bank's policy statement or in the guidance Fed Chair Jerome Powell offers in his post-meeting press conference. The statement is due to be released at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), with Powell speaking to reporters half an hour later.\n\nGiven the current stalled progress on inflation, many analysts expect the Fed's \"dot plot\" projection for its benchmark policy rate to show only two quarter-percentage-point rate cuts by the end of this year, versus the three anticipated as of March - if only to account for the lapse of time. But the median could easily tip to only one cut among a nearly evenly divided group of policymakers.\n\n\"If there is any risk ... it's that there will be only one 25-basis-point rate cut this year,\" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist for RSM US, with Powell using his press conference to \"manage expectations\" at a point where Fed policymakers feel particularly uncertain about the path the economy may follow. CPI DATA\n\nPowell and other policymakers have minimized the risk of a further rate increase. The Fed aggressively raised rates in 2022 and 2023 after inflation surged to a 40-year peak. The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, has declined from a 7.1% peak annual pace in June 2022 to 2.7% as of April. The current policy rate is regarded as restrictive enough to discourage investment and spending and gradually return inflation to the Fed's target.\n\nYet policymakers are not ready to commit to any cuts until they've seen more progress. Just as they acknowledge risks that unemployment could rise fast and warrant rate cuts to support the economy, they see aspects of inflation, particularly in housing and the broad services sector, that may have stalled at too high a level. Economists polled by Reuters expect the consumer price index rose only 0.1% in May, which would be the weakest reading since October, with \"core\" prices excluding food and energy forecast to increase 0.3%. The U.S. Labor Department is due to release the CPI report at 8:30 a.m. EDT.\n\nWhile the year-over-year CPI rates are expected to show no or little change from April, the report's details should be seen \"as a step in the right direction,\" after inflation surged more than expected earlier in 2024, BNP Paribas economists wrote. In their final comments before the latest policy meeting, a number of central bank officials, including Fed Governor Christopher Waller, said they needed to see several more months of improving inflation data before deciding to cut rates, statements investors have construed as pushing back any rate reduction to the Fed's Sept. 17-18 meeting at the earliest.\n\nEven that start date for the policy easing is a virtual toss-up. As of Tuesday, there was less than a 51% likelihood of a U.S. rate cut in September, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Waller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Waller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_consumption_expenditures_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal consumption expenditures price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNP_Paribas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BNP Paribas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/28_05_2024_04_57_13_1955595.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-17", "dateEnd": "-09-18", "textStart": 4073, "textEnd": 4084}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

These are expected to indicate that they will reduce their benchmark rate only once or twice by the end of the year, rather than the three times they had anticipated in March.\n\nThe Fed's rate policies usually significantly influence the costs of mortgages, auto loans, credit card rates and other forms of consumer and business borrowing. The downgrade in their outlook for rate cuts implies that such borrowing costs would likely remain higher for longer, a letdown for potential homebuyers and others.\n\nHowever, the Fed's quarterly projections of future interest rate cuts are not set in stone. The policymakers frequently adjust their plans for rate cuts - or increases - based on how economic growth and inflation measures change over time.\n\nBorrowing costs staying high could spell trouble for the presidential race, with President Joe Biden's administration already facing a grim view from voters due to soaring prices since the pandemic. Despite a low unemployment rate of 4%, robust hiring, and steady consumer spending, the high cost of living continues to weigh heavily on public sentiment.\n\nThe Fed's economic outlook, set to be updated on Wednesday, will take into account May's inflation data, which is anticipated to show a 0.3% rise in core inflation, mirroring the previous month and exceeding the Fed's comfort zone. While overall inflation may have seen only a slight 0.1% increase thanks to decreasing gas prices, year-on-year figures are expected to reveal a 3.4% jump in consumer prices for May, consistent with April's numbers.\n\nAfter a period of declining inflation in the latter half of last year, there was optimism that the Fed might pull off a \"soft landing,\" successfully reining in inflation without triggering a recessiona challenging and uncommon feat. However, higher-than-anticipated inflation in the first quarter has dashed hopes for early rate cuts and put the possibility of a soft landing at risk.\n\nIn early May, Jerome Powell, the Chair of the central bank, stated that more assurance was needed that inflation was returning to its target before the benchmark rate could be reduced. He noted that gaining this confidence would likely take longer than Fed officials had previously anticipated.\n\nChristopher Waller, a key member of the Fed's Board of Governors, expressed last month that he required \"several more months of good inflation data\" before he would consider backing rate cuts. While Waller didn't specify what would constitute good data, economists believe it would need to be core inflation of 0.2% or less each month.\n\nPowell and other Fed policymakers have also indicated that as long as the economy remains robust, they see no immediate need to reduce rates. Matthew Luzzetti, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to clients: \"Fed officials have clearly signaled that they are in a wait-and-see mode with respect to the timing and magnitude of rate cuts,\".\n\nThe Fed's approach to its rate policies is heavily dependent on the latest economic data. In the past, the central bank would have placed more emphasis on its projections for inflation and economic growth in the upcoming months.\n\nHowever, Nathan Sheets, chief global economist at Citi and a former top economist at the Fed, said: \"They don't have any confidence in their ability to forecast inflation.\" In his view, \"No one has been successful at forecasting inflation\" for the past three to four years.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lawrence_matheson@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lawrence Matheson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Waller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Waller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/money/article33011477.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_federal-reserve.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

The inflation figures, released just a few hours before Federal Reserve officials are set to announce their strategies for rate cuts this year, came in slightly below the projections of most economists. This development has provided a positive outlook for President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nConsumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs -- the closely watched \"core\" index -- rose 0.2% from April to May, the government said Wednesday. That was down from 0.3% the previous month and was the smallest increase since October. Measured from a year earlier, core prices rose 3.4%, below last month's 3.6% increase.\n\nFed officials are scrutinizing each month's inflation data to assess their progress in their fight against rising prices. Even as overall inflation moderates, such necessities as groceries, rent and health care are much pricier than they were three years ago -- a continuing source of public discontent and a political threat to President Joe Biden's re-election bid. Most other measures suggest that the economy is healthy: Unemployment remains low, hiring is robust and consumers are traveling, eating out and spending on entertainment.\n\nOverall inflation also slowed last month, with consumer prices unchanged from April to May, in part because of sharp falls in the cost of gasoline, air fares and new cars. Measured from a year earlier, consumer prices rose 3.3%, less than the 3.6% increase a month earlier.\n\nThe cost of auto insurance, which has soared in recent months, actually dipped from April to May, though it's still up more than 20% from a year earlier. Grocery prices were unchanged last month, after declining slightly in April. They're now up just 1% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe Fed has kept its key rate unchanged for nearly a year after having rapidly raised it in 2022 and 2023 to fight the worst bout of inflation in four decades. Those higher rates have led, in turn, to more expensive mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other forms of consumer and business borrowing. Though inflation is now far below its peak of 9.1% in mid-2022, it remains above the Fed's target level.\n\nPersistently elevated inflation has posed a vexing challenge for the Fed, which raises interest rates -- or keeps them high -- to try to slow borrowing and spending, cool the economy and ease the pace of price increases.\n\nThe longer the Fed keeps borrowing costs high, the more it risks weakening the economy too much and causing a recession. Yet if it cuts rates too soon, it risks reigniting inflation. Most of the policymakers have said they think their rate policies are slowing growth and should curb inflation over time.\n\nInflation had fallen steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could pull off a \"soft landing,\" whereby it manages to conquer inflation through higher interest rates without causing a recession. Such an outcome is difficult and rare.\n\nBut inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and possibly imperiling a soft landing.\n\nIn early May, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its target before it would reduce its benchmark rate. Several Fed officials have said in recent weeks that they needed to see several consecutive months of lower inflation.\n\nSome signs suggest that inflation will continue to cool in the coming months. Americans, particularly lower-income households, are pulling back on their spending. In response, several major retail and restaurant chains, including Walmart, Target, Walgreen's, McDonald's and Burger King, have responded by announcing price cuts or deals.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger_King", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burger King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walmart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Target Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-2024-05-16T110930.088-2024-05-dc26b0e131b79de1e4251bc19950b415.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

In the past, the central bank would have put more weight on where it envisioned inflation and economic growth in the coming months.\n\nYet now, \"they don't have any confidence in their ability to forecast inflation,\" said Nathan Sheets, chief global economist at Citi and a former top economist at the Fed.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Waller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Waller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Board_of_Governors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Board of Governors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/pKOMN39bLUvCr5P4tfHCAviuKe8=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/2HFBUIXMB4SAPHNABV6IUPK76A.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

The trend, if it holds, could move the Federal Reserve closer to cutting its benchmark interest rate from its 23-year peak.\n\nConsumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs -- the closely watched \"core\" index -- rose 0.2% from April to May, the government said Wednesday. That was down from 0.3% the previous month and was the smallest increase since October. Measured from a year earlier, core prices climbed 3.4%, below last month's 3.6% rise. That was the mildest such increase in three years.\n\nFed officials are scrutinizing each month's inflation data to assess their progress in their fight against rising prices. Even as overall inflation moderates, such necessities as groceries, rent and health care are much pricier than they were three years ago -- a continuing source of public discontent and a political threat to President Joe Biden's re-election bid. Most other measures suggest that the economy is healthy: Unemployment remains low, hiring is robust and consumers are traveling, eating out and spending on entertainment.\n\nWednesday's report suggested that consumers are beginning to get some relief from the price spikes of the past three years. Grocery costs were unchanged, on average, from April to May, after actually falling 0.2% the previous month. Food prices have risen just 1% over the past 12 months, though they're still up about 20% from three years ago.\n\nOverall inflation also slowed last month, with consumer prices unchanged from April to May. Measured from a year earlier, prices rose 3.3%, less than the 3.6% increase a month earlier.\n\n\"It's certainly welcome news,\" said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at PGIM Fixed Income. \"It drives home that the inflation challenge in the United States is not as challenging as monetary policy makers believe.\"\n\nAirfares, furniture and clothing also dropped in price last month, helping keep inflation in check. And the cost of auto insurance, which has soared in recent months, actually dipped from April to May, though it's still up more than 20% from a year earlier.\n\nThe Fed has kept its key rate unchanged for nearly a year after having rapidly raised it in 2022 and 2023 to fight the worst bout of inflation in four decades. Those higher rates have led, in turn, to more expensive mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other forms of consumer and business borrowing. Though inflation is now far below its peak of 9.1% in mid-2022, it remains above the Fed's target level.\n\nPersistently elevated inflation has posed a vexing challenge for the Fed, which raises interest rates -- or keeps them high -- to try to slow borrowing and spending, cool the economy and ease the pace of price increases.\n\nThe longer the Fed keeps borrowing costs high, the more it risks weakening the economy too much and causing a recession. Yet if it cuts rates too soon, it risks reigniting inflation. Most of the policymakers have said they think their rate policies are slowing growth and should curb inflation over time.\n\nInflation had fallen steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could pull off a \"soft landing,\" whereby it manages to conquer inflation through higher interest rates without causing a recession. Such an outcome is difficult and rare.\n\nBut inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and possibly imperiling a soft landing.\n\nIn early May, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its target before it would reduce its benchmark rate. Several Fed officials have said in recent weeks that they needed to see several consecutive months of lower inflation.\n\nSome signs suggest that inflation will continue to cool in the coming months. Americans, particularly lower-income households, are pulling back on their spending. In response, several major retail and restaurant chains, including Walmart, Target, Walgreen's, McDonald's and Burger King, have responded by announcing price cuts or deals.", "source": {"uri": "wbrz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBRZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fixed income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grocery store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger_King", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burger King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walmart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Target Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Quantity_Cooking", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Quantity Cooking", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://dcer237tfveol.cloudfront.net/v2/Gyjo9cabsRrRltVywN6AkwPIF7ApfZcUfGDIqv0xc-Z_4-uSXw43zFjlXKFShrMYdV_YIg3WiL2SlhHA058vzXqjyc1CwH2YrrZeZlbtOgs3r3Chzsl9om3xHT1bUHAV0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

That is a more positive assessment than after the Fed's previous meeting May 1, when the officials had said there had been \"a lack of further progress\" on inflation.\n\nThe policymakers, as expected, kept their key rate unchanged Wednesday at roughly 5.3%. The benchmark rate has remained at that level since July of last year, after the Fed raised it 11 times to try to slow borrowing and spending and cool inflation. Fed rate cuts would, over time, lighten loan costs for consumers, who have faced punishingly high rates for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other forms of borrowing.\n\nThe officials' rate-cut forecast reflects the individual estimates of 19 policymakers. The Fed said that eight of those officials projected two rate cuts and seven projected one cut. Four said they envisioned no cuts at all this year.\n\nThe Fed's updated quarterly projections are by no means fixed in time. The policymakers frequently revise their plans for rate cuts -- or hikes -- depending on how economic growth and inflation measures evolve over time.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the government reported that inflation eased in May for a second straight month, a hopeful sign that an acceleration of prices that occurred early this year may have passed.\n\nThe central bank's rate policies over the next several months could also have consequences for the presidential race. Though the unemployment rate is a low 4%, hiring is robust and consumers continue to spend, voters have taken a generally sour view of the economy under President Joe Biden. In large part, that's because prices remain much higher than they were before the pandemic struck. High borrowing rates impose a further financial burden.\n\nInflation had cooled steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could achieve a rare \"soft landing,\" whereby it would manage to conquer inflation through rate hikes without causing a recession.

They expect core inflation to be 2.8% by year's end, according to their preferred gauge, up from a previous forecast of 2.6%.

The Fed said that eight of those officials projected two rate cuts and seven projected one cut. Four said they envisioned no cuts at all this year.\n\nThe Fed's updated quarterly projections are by no means fixed in time. The policymakers frequently revise their plans for rate cuts - or hikes - depending on how economic growth and inflation evolve over time.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the government reported that inflation eased in May for a second straight month, a hopeful sign that an acceleration of prices that occurred earlier this year may have passed.\n\nConsumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs - the closely watched \"core\" index - rose just 0.2% from April, the smallest rise since October. Measured from a year earlier, core prices climbed 3.4%, the mildest pace in three years.\n\nThough inflation has tumbled from a peak of 9.1% two years ago, it remains too high for the Fed's liking. The policymakers now face the delicate task of keeping rates high enough to slow spending and defeat high inflation without derailing the economy.\n\nThe central bank's rate policies over the next several months could also have consequences for the presidential race.\n\nThough the unemployment rate is a low 4%, hiring is robust and consumers continue to spend, voters have taken a generally sour view of the economy under President Joe Biden. In large part, that is because prices remain much higher than they were before the pandemic struck. High borrowing rates impose a further financial burden.\n\nInflation had cooled steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could achieve a rare \"soft landing\", whereby it would manage to conquer inflation through rate hikes without causing a recession.\n\nBut inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and potentially imperilling a soft landing.\n\nAs part of the updated quarterly forecasts the Fed's policymakers issued on Wednesday, they projected that the economy will grow 2.1% this year and 2% in 2025, the same as they had envisioned in March.\n\nThey expect core inflation to be 2.8% by the year's end, according to their preferred gauge, up from a previous forecast of 2.6%. And they project that unemployment will stay at its current 4% rate by the end of this year and edge up to 4.2% by the end of 2025.", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy_and_Forecasting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy and Forecasting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/extra/assets/img/dummy-social.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 531, "textEnd": 536}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Even as overall inflation moderates, necessities such as groceries, rent, and health care are much pricier than they were three years ago.\n\nWASHINGTON -- Inflation in America eased in May for a second straight month, a hopeful sign that a pickup in prices that occurred early this year may have passed. The trend, if it holds, could move the Federal Reserve closer to cutting its benchmark interest rate from its 23-year peak.\n\nConsumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs -- the closely watched \"core\" index -- rose 0.2 percent from April to May, the government said Wednesday. That was down from 0.3 percent the previous month and was the smallest increase since October. Measured from a year earlier, core prices rose 3.4 percent, below last month's 3.6 percent increase.\n\nFed officials are scrutinizing each month's inflation data to assess their progress in their fight against rising prices. Even as overall inflation moderates, such necessities as groceries, rent, and health care are much pricier than they were three years ago -- a continuing source of public discontent and a political threat to President Biden's re-election bid. Most other measures suggest that the economy is healthy: Unemployment remains low, hiring is robust, and consumers are traveling, eating out, and spending on entertainment.\n\nOverall inflation also slowed last month, with consumer prices unchanged from April to May, in part because of sharp falls in the cost of gasoline, air fares, and new cars. Measured from a year earlier, consumer prices rose 3.3 percent, less than the 3.6 percent increase a month earlier.\n\nThe cost of auto insurance, which has soared in recent months, actually dipped from April to May, though it's still up more than 20 percent from a year earlier. Grocery prices were unchanged last month, after declining slightly in April. They're now up just 1 percent on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe Fed has kept its key rate unchanged for nearly a year after having rapidly raised it in 2022 and 2023 to fight the worst bout of inflation in four decades. Those higher rates have led, in turn, to more expensive mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, and other forms of consumer and business borrowing. Though inflation is now far below its peak of 9.1 percent in mid-2022, it remains above the Fed's target level.\n\nPersistently elevated inflation has posed a vexing challenge for the Fed, which raises interest rates -- or keeps them high -- to try to slow borrowing and spending, cool the economy, and ease the pace of price increases.\n\nThe longer the Fed keeps borrowing costs high, the more it risks weakening the economy too much and causing a recession. Yet if it cuts rates too soon, it risks reigniting inflation. Most of the policymakers have said they think their rate policies are slowing growth and should curb inflation over time.\n\nInflation had fallen steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could pull off a \"soft landing,\" whereby it manages to conquer inflation through higher interest rates without causing a recession. Such an outcome is difficult and rare.\n\nYet inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and possibly imperiling a soft landing.\n\nIn early May, the chairman of the Fed, Jerome Powell, said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its target before it would reduce its benchmark rate. Several Fed officials have said in recent weeks that they needed to see several consecutive months of lower inflation.\n\nSome signs suggest that inflation will continue to cool in the coming months.

But when the government reports the latest monthly price data Wednesday, Wall Street traders and Federal Reserve officials will be paying particularly close attention to an index that excludes volatile food and energy costs.\n\nThese so-called \"core\" prices are expected to have risen 0.3 percent from April to May, the same as in the previous month, according to a survey of economists by data provider FactSet. Compared with a year earlier, core inflation is thought to have dipped from 3.6 percent to 3.5 percent.\n\nEven as overall inflation moderates, such necessities as groceries, rent, and health care are much pricier than they were three years ago -- a continuing source of public discontent and a political threat to President Joe Biden's re-election bid.\n\nMost other measures suggest that the economy is healthy: Unemployment remains low, hiring is robust and consumers are traveling, eating out, and spending on entertainment. Yet polls show that the cumulative price increases are weighing on Biden's popularity.\n\nThe Fed is closely monitoring each month's inflation report for signs that it's succeeding in its fight against rising prices. A rise in core consumer prices of 0.3 percent is too high, over time, to be consistent with the central bank's 2 percent annual inflation target and could be seen as a disappointment. Still, the Fed's officials prefer a separate inflation measure, which typically comes in slightly lower than Wednesday's consumer price index.\n\nREAD: US consumer inflation eased slightly in April, in good news for Biden\n\nAfter their latest two-day policy meeting ends Wednesday -- just hours after the release of the May inflation data -- the officials are poised to leave their benchmark interest rate unchanged at a 23-year high of about 5.3 percent.\n\nBorrowing and spending\n\nLower gas prices are thought to have slowed overall inflation to just 0.1 percent from April to May, according to FactSet, down from 0.3 percent the previous month and the lowest figure since October. Measured from a year earlier, consumer prices are believed to have risen 3.4 percent in May, the same as in April.\n\nPersistently elevated inflation has posed a vexing challenge for the Fed, which raises interest rates -- or keeps them high -- to try to slow borrowing and spending, cool the economy, and ease the pace of price increases.\n\nThe Fed has kept its key rate unchanged for nearly a year after having rapidly raised it in 2022 and 2023.

Powell noted that it would likely take more time to gain that confidence than Fed officials had previously thought. Several officials have said in recent weeks that they needed to see several consecutive months of lower inflation.\n\nIn addition to declining gas prices, economists have estimated that prices for several other items fell from April to May, including clothing, furniture, and new cars. Though used cars are projected to have risen in price after falling for several months, that may prove a temporary blip.\n\nThe cost of apartment rents, a key driver of inflation, could cool slightly. Auto insurance is thought to have risen by a sharp 1% just from April to May, according to economists at Goldman Sachs, though that would be down from increases of 1.8% and 2.6% in the previous two months.\n\nSome signs suggest that inflation will continue to cool in the coming months.

It does this by managing the federal funds rate, which influences borrowing costs for everything else in the economy.\n\nFor the past year, the Fed has held that rate at approximately 5.5%.\n\nBy keeping interest rates elevated, the Fed hopes to reduce consumer demand for goods and services -- and in turn slow price growth. When consumers find it easier to make purchases, businesses feel more comfortable raising prices.\n\nThe Fed's policy has resulted in APRs of more than 20% on most major credit cards, according to Bankrate, alongside mortgage and auto loan rates starting at 7%.\n\nThose higher rates may be working: Earlier Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 12-month inflation hit 3.3% in May, compared with 3.5% in April and lower than analysts' expectations.\n\nOn a monthly basis, inflation didn't rise at all, the first time that's happened since July 2022.\n\nFed officials have indicated they are in no rush yet to change the current rate level, hoping instead for continued progress on price growth.\n\n\"Many more months of positive inflation data, I think, to give me confidence that it's appropriate to dial back,\" Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, told CNBC last month in an interview when asked about what it would take for interest rates to come down.\n\nBut Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM accounting and consultancy group, said the slowing price-growth trend is likely to continue through the summer and could lead to a rate cut as soon as this fall.\n\n\"This should play into the Federal Reserve's forecast which points to a September rate cut as both the consumer price index and the personal consumer expenditure price index inch back towards the Fed's long term 2% inflation target,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. economy is showing signs of softening elsewhere too.\n\nIn a note to clients, ING financial services group chief internatinoal economist James Knightley said he believes the Fed could cut soon given softening inflation, rising unemployment -- now at 4% -- and slowing consumer spending.\n\n\"Today's outcome has boosted the chances of a September start point for rate cuts considerably,\" he wrote, referring to the Wednesday inflation report.\n\nThe Fed rate holds are coming at a time when it is facing some external pressure to cut. This week, three U.S. senators led by Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) called on the Fed to lower rates because they are driving up housing and insurance costs.\n\nMeanwhile, Canada and the European Union also recently announced their own rate cuts.\n\nAs an independent central bank, the Fed is unlikely to be influenced directly by such outside pressures.\n\nInstead, Fed officials have uniformly asserted that their decisions are dependent on data.\n\nNow, the data are increasingly showing an economy that is no longer overheating.\n\n\"Fed officials ... will clearly welcome this slowing in inflation,\" economic analysts with Citi Research wrote Wednesday. \"We continue to expect the first rate cut in September and consecutive 25 (basis-point) cuts thereafter.\"", "source": {"uri":

The Fed aggressively raised rates in 2022 and 2023 after inflation surged to a 40-year peak.\n\nThe personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, has declined from a 7.1% peak annual pace in June 2022 to 2.7% as of April. The current policy rate is regarded as restrictive enough to discourage investment and spending and gradually return inflation to the Fed's target.\n\nYet policymakers are not ready to commit to any cuts until they've seen more progress. Just as they acknowledge risks that unemployment could rise fast and warrant rate cuts to support the economy, they see aspects of inflation, particularly in housing and the broad services sector, that may have stalled at too high a level.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters expect the consumer price index rose only 0.1% in May, which would be the weakest reading since October, with \"core\" prices excluding food and energy forecast to increase 0.3%. The U.S. Labor Department is due to release the CPI report at 8:30 a.m. EDT.\n\nWhile the year-over-year CPI rates are expected to show no or little change from April, the report's details should be seen \"as a step in the right direction,\" after inflation surged more than expected earlier in 2024, BNP Paribas economists wrote.\n\nIn their final comments before the latest policy meeting, a number of central bank officials, including Fed Governor Christopher Waller, said they needed to see several more months of improving inflation data before deciding to cut rates, statements investors have construed as pushing back any rate reduction to the Fed's Sept. 17-18 meeting at the earliest.\n\nEven that start date for the policy easing is a virtual toss-up. As of Tuesday, there was less than a 51% likelihood of a U.S. rate cut in September, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.

That's less than the forecasted 0.1% increase and quite a bit down from the 0.3% increase in April.\n\nThe numbers came out this morning, the same day as the Federal Reserve Open Market meeting is set to conclude. It's highly unlikely the report will affect the Fed's expected vote to hold interest rates steady, but it could affect the tone of Chair Jerome Powell's post-meeting news conference, scheduled to start at 2:30 p.m. ET.\n\nAnnual inflation increased by 3.3% overall, slightly down from April. Core inflation -- excluding volatile food and energy prices -- rose 0.2% month over month, also slightly down from April.\n\nOver the past two years, the Fed raised interest rates to rein in soaring inflation. After regaining momentum in early 2024, inflation rose by slightly less in April. But prices are expected to remain high, as are borrowing rates.\n\nHere's what you need to know about inflation, what the Fed might do about it later today and how it will affect your finances.\n\nInflation is the rate of increase in prices and goods over a period of time. Contributing factors can include consumer demand, labor costs and supply chain disruptions. Amid the pandemic, inflation soared, topping out at 9.1% in June 2022. The Fed's target rate is 2%.\n\nRunaway inflation made everything more expensive, including essentials like food, gas and housing.\n\nThe Fed attempted to bring inflation under control by raising the federal funds rate -- the interest rate banks charge each other for borrowing and lending -- to make borrowing more costly and thus slow down the economy.\n\nThat's made borrowing -- whether it's credit cards, auto loans or mortgages -- more expensive.\n\nBut leaving high interest rates in place for too long could create a drag on the economy as employers pull back on hiring and consumers stop spending. With inflation showing signs of abating in the first half of 2023, the Fed had originally penciled in three rate cuts for 2024.\n\nThe Fed will likely hold the federal funds rate at a target range of 5.25% to 5.50%, as it's done since August 2023.\n\nAfter showing signs of easing in 2023, inflation inched upward again in the first quarter of 2024. At the conclusion of the April/May Federal Open Market Committee meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that this \"lack of progress\" on inflation could delay potential interest rate cuts.\n\n\"Gaining greater confidence will take longer than previously expected,\" Powell said during the press conference.\n\nWith inflation sticking stubbornly above its 2% target and US employers adding more jobs in May than expected, the chances for multiple interest rate cuts in 2024 -- if any at all -- are dimming.\n\nPowell's comments could offer some insight into whether the Fed is still considering rate cuts with four meetings left this year -- in July, September, November and December.\n\nWhen inflation and interest rates are high, it's best to find ways to save money, stick to a budget and avoid debt when possible.\n\nCredit card interest rates will likely remain high through the end of the year and into 2025. If you're carrying credit card debt, consider ways to reduce the amount you pay in interest, like applying for a debt consolidation loan or a balance transfer card.\n\nMortgage and refinance rates are still relatively high. Even if they decline by the end of the year, don't expect them to drop back to pandemic lows.

Compared with a year earlier, core inflation is thought to have dipped from 3.6% to 3.5%.\n\nEven as overall inflation moderates, such necessities as groceries, rent and health care are much pricier than they were three years ago -- a continuing source of public discontent and a political threat to President Joe Biden's re-election bid. Most other measures suggest that the economy is healthy: Unemployment remains low, hiring is robust and consumers are traveling, eating out and spending on entertainment. Yet polls show that the cumulative price increases are weighing on Biden's popularity.\n\nThe Fed is closely monitoring each month's inflation report for signs that it's succeeding in its fight against rising prices. A rise in core consumer prices of 0.3% is too high, over time, to be consistent with the central bank's 2% annual inflation target and could be seen as a disappointment. Still, the Fed's officials prefer a separate inflation measure, which typically comes in slightly lower than Wednesday's consumer price index.\n\nAfter their latest two-day policy meeting ends Wednesday -- just hours after the release of the May inflation data -- the officials are poised to leave their benchmark interest rate unchanged at a 23-year high of about 5.3%.\n\nLower gas prices are thought to have slowed overall inflation to just 0.1% from April to May, according to FactSet, down from 0.3% the previous month and the lowest figure since October.

Powell noted that it would likely take more time to gain that confidence than Fed officials had previously thought. Several officials have said in recent weeks that they needed to see several consecutive months of lower inflation.\n\nIn addition to declining gas prices, economists have estimated that prices for several other items fell from April to May, including clothing, furniture and new cars. Though used cars are projected to have risen in price after falling for several months, that may prove a temporary blip.\n\nThe cost of apartment rents, a key driver of inflation, could cool slightly. And auto insurance is thought to have risen by a sharp 1% just from April to May, according to economists at Goldman Sachs, though that would be down from increases of 1.8% and 2.6% in the previous two months.\n\nSome signs suggest that inflation will continue to cool in the coming months.

That is a more positive assessment than after the Fed's previous meeting May 1, when the officials said there had been \"a lack of further progress\" on inflation.\n\nAlso Read | Kuwait Building Fire: Death Toll in Building Blaze Climbs to 49; PM Narendra Modi, EAM S Jaishankar Condole Deaths (Watch Videos).\n\nThe policymakers, as expected, kept their key rate unchanged at roughly 5.3 per cent. The benchmark rate has remained at that level since July of last year, after the Fed raised it 11 times to try to slow borrowing and spending and cool inflation. Fed rate cuts would, over time, lighten loan costs for consumers, who have faced punishingly high rates for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other forms of borrowing.\n\nThe officials' rate-cut forecast reflects the individual estimates of 19 policymakers. The Fed said that eight of those officials projected two rate cuts and seven projected one cut. Four said they envisioned no cuts at all this year.\n\nThe Fed's updated quarterly projections are by no means fixed in time. The policymakers frequently revise their plans for rate cuts -- or hikes -- depending on how economic growth and inflation evolve over time.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the government reported that inflation eased in May for a second straight month, a hopeful sign that an acceleration of prices that occurred early this year may have passed. Consumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs -- the closely watched \"core\" index -- rose just 0.2 per cent from April, the smallest rise since October. Measured from a year earlier, core prices climbed 3.4 per cent, the mildest pace in three years.\n\nThough inflation has tumbled from a peak of 9.1 per cent two years ago, it remains too high for the Fed's liking. The policymakers now face the delicate task of keeping rates high enough to slow spending and defeat high inflation without derailing the economy.\n\nThe central bank's rate policies over the next several months could also have consequences for the presidential race. Though the unemployment rate is a low 4 per cent, hiring is robust and consumers continue to spend, voters have taken a generally sour view of the economy under President Joe Biden. In large part, that's because prices remain much higher than they were before the pandemic struck. High borrowing rates impose a further financial burden.\n\nInflation had cooled steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could achieve a rare \"soft landing\", whereby it would manage to conquer inflation through rate hikes without causing a recession. But inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and potentially imperiling a soft landing.\n\nIn early May, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its target before it would reduce its benchmark rate. Powell noted that it would likely take more time to gain that confidence than Fed officials had previously thought.\n\nLast month, Christopher Waller, an influential member of the Fed's Board of Governors, said he needed to see \"several more months of good inflation data\" before he would consider supporting rate cuts. Though Waller didn't spell out what would constitute good data, economists think it would have to be core inflation of 0.2 per cent or less each month.\n\nAs part of the updated quarterly forecasts the Fed's policymakers issued on Wednesday, they projected that the economy will grow 2.1 per cent this year and 2 per cent in 2025, the same as they had envisioned in March. They expect core inflation to be 2.8 per cent by year's end, according to their preferred gauge, up from a previous forecast of 2.6 per cent. And they project that unemployment will stay at its current 4 per cent rate by the end of this year and edge up to 4.2 per cent by the end of 2025.

The Fed aggressively raised rates in 2022 and 2023 after inflation surged to a 40-year peak.\n\nThe personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, has declined from a 7.1% peak annual pace in June 2022 to 2.7% as of April. The current policy rate is regarded as restrictive enough to discourage investment and spending and gradually return inflation to the Fed's target.\n\nYet policymakers are not ready to commit to any cuts until they've seen more progress. Just as they acknowledge risks that unemployment could rise fast and warrant rate cuts to support the economy, they see aspects of inflation, particularly in housing and the broad services sector, that may have stalled at too high a level.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters expect the consumer price index rose only 0.1% in May, which would be the weakest reading since October, with \"core\" prices excluding food and energy forecast to increase 0.3%. The U.S. Labor Department is due to release the CPI report at 8:30 a.m. EDT.\n\nWhile the year-over-year CPI rates are expected to show no or little change from April, the report's details should be seen \"as a step in the right direction,\" after inflation surged more than expected earlier in 2024, BNP Paribas economists wrote.\n\nIn their final comments before the latest policy meeting, a number of central bank officials, including Fed Governor Christopher Waller, said they needed to see several more months of improving inflation data before deciding to cut rates, statements investors have construed as pushing back any rate reduction to the Fed's Sept. 17-18 meeting at the earliest.\n\nEven that start date for the policy easing is a virtual toss-up. As of Tuesday, there was less than a 51% likelihood of a U.S. rate cut in September, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n\n(Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Paul Simao)", "source": {"uri": "money.usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@money.usnews.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Waller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Waller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_consumption_expenditures_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal consumption expenditures price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tertiary sector of the economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNP_Paribas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BNP Paribas"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/4111430/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F53%2F6726ad174c2b0911c49ec5150ee7a5%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK5B0EE%3A12024-06-12T101440Z_1_LYNXMPEK5B0EE_RTROPTP_3_GLOBAL-FOREX.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-17", "dateEnd": "-09-18", "textStart": 3719, "textEnd": 3730}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Though inflation is now far below its peak of 9.1% in mid-2022, it remains above the Fed's target level.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Less-expensive gas likely slowed U.S. consumer inflation in May. But when the government reports the latest monthly price data Wednesday, Wall Street traders and Federal Reserve officials will be paying particularly close attention to an index that excludes volatile food and energy costs.\n\nThese so-called \"core\"\u009d prices are expected to have risen 0.3% from April to May, the same as in the previous month, according to a survey of economists by data provider FactSet. Compared with a year earlier, core inflation is thought to have dipped from 3.6% to 3.5%.\n\nEven as overall inflation moderates, such necessities as groceries, rent and health care are much pricier than they were three years ago - a continuing source of public discontent and a political threat to President Joe Biden's re-election bid. Most other measures suggest that the economy is healthy: Unemployment remains low, hiring is robust and consumers are traveling, eating out and spending on entertainment. Yet polls show that the cumulative price increases are weighing on Biden's popularity.\n\nThe Fed is closely monitoring each month's inflation report for signs that it's succeeding in its fight against rising prices. A rise in core consumer prices of 0.3% is too high, over time, to be consistent with the central bank's 2% annual inflation target and could be seen as a disappointment. Still, the Fed's officials prefer a separate inflation measure, which typically comes in slightly lower than Wednesday's consumer price index.\n\nAfter their latest two-day policy meeting ends Wednesday - just hours after the release of the May inflation data - the officials are poised to leave their benchmark interest rate unchanged at a 23-year high of about 5.3%.\n\nLower gas prices are thought to have slowed overall inflation to just 0.1% from April to May, according to FactSet, down from 0.3% the previous month and the lowest figure since October. Measured from a year earlier, consumer prices are believed to have risen 3.4% in May, the same as in April.\n\nPersistently elevated inflation has posed a vexing challenge for the Fed, which raises interest rates - or keeps them high - to try to slow borrowing and spending, cool the economy and ease the pace of price increases. The Fed has kept its key rate unchanged for nearly a year after having rapidly raised it in 2022 and 2023. Those higher rates have led, in turn, to more expensive mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other forms of consumer and business borrowing.\n\nThe longer the Fed keeps borrowing costs high, the more it risks weakening the economy too much and potentially causing a recession. Yet if it cuts rates too soon, it risks reigniting inflation. Most of the policymakers have said they think their rate policies are slowing growth and should curb inflation over time.\n\nInflation had fallen steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could pull off a \"soft landing,\" whereby it manages to conquer inflation through higher interest rates without causing a recession. Such an outcome is difficult and rare.\n\nBut inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and possibly imperiling a soft landing.\n\nIn early May, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its target before it would reduce its benchmark rate. Powell noted that it would likely take more time to gain that confidence than Fed officials had previously thought. Several officials have said in recent weeks that they needed to see several consecutive months of lower inflation.\n\nIn addition to declining gas prices, economists have estimated that prices for several other items fell from April to May, including clothing, furniture and new cars. Though used cars are projected to have risen in price after falling for several months, that may prove a temporary blip.\n\nThe cost of apartment rents, a key driver of inflation, could cool slightly. And auto insurance is thought to have risen by a sharp 1% just from April to May, according to economists at Goldman Sachs, though that would be down from increases of 1.8% and 2.6% in the previous two months.\n\nSome signs suggest that inflation will continue to cool in the coming months. Americans, particularly lower-income households, are pulling back on their spending.

They also expect inflation to be more stubborn this year than they thought in the spring, according to their forecasts.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the May Consumer Price Index, released earlier Wednesday, was \"certainly a better inflation report than almost anybody expected.\" But he said officials still want to see inflation slow further before lowering borrowing costs.\n\nThe Fed has kept interest rates at a 23-year high for nearly a year, after kicking off an aggressive rate-hiking campaign in March 2022. Central bankers are waiting for more evidence that inflation is headed toward 2% -- and the economy's resilience is allowing them to be comfortably on hold. The Fed will begin cutting interest rates once it's clear that inflation has cooled enough and won't heat back up -- or if the job market deteriorates much more than expected, but there are currently not many signs of that.\n\nThe inflation situation is now better than it was in the first quarter: Consumer prices eased in May, the Labor Department reported Wednesday morning. From a year earlier, inflation rose 3.3% in May, down from April's 3.4% rise and also below economists' expectations.\n\nFed officials' latest policy statement noted that inflation has seen some \"modest further progress\" toward their 2% target in recent months, versus the May statement that noted there had been a \"lack\" of any improvements.\n\nHere are key takeaways from the Fed's latest decision on interest rates.\n\nPowell calls May inflation data 'encouraging'\n\nNot only was the Fed chief pleased with Wednesday's inflation report, saying it was a \"good reading,\" but he maintained his view that interest rates are \"restrictive\" enough to rein in price hikes.\n\nPowell pointed to the substantial progress seen in the second half of last year as an example. Still, he said officials now think \"it's probably going to take longer to get the confidence needed to loosen policy,\" compared to what they thought in March. That's precisely what officials' forecasts showed.\n\nWhen asked what will help tug inflation closer to the Fed's 2% target, Powell said slower inflation will come \"from where it's been coming from,\" pointing to the \"the unwinding of the pandemic-related distortions to both supply and demand.\"\n\n\"And that is complemented by, amplified by, supported by restrictive monetary policy, so those two things are working together,\" he said. \"We've made pretty good progress on inflation with our current [policy] stance.\"\n\nEconomists have said that it's only a matter of time until declining rents show up in official inflation gauges. Still-high housing costs are still looming large in the CPI: Shelter inflation more than offset the decline in gasoline seen last month, rising 0.4% for the fourth month in a row, the May CPI showed.\n\nNo concerns about the job market\n\nPowell has frequently said the job market likely needs to come back \"into better balance\" to ensure that inflation is on track to 2%. That's because a labor market that's running too hot could put some upward pressure on prices, making the Fed's job of fully defeating inflation more difficult.\n\nThe Fed chief says so far so good.\n\n\"Overall, a broad set of indicators suggest that conditions in the labor market have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic, relatively tight but not overheated,\" Powell said in his post-meeting press conference on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nHe pointed to data proving just that: Job gains averaging 218,000 a month in April and May; unemployment still at low levels, job creation driven by more prime-aged workers and immigrants trickling into the workforce; slower wage growth; and a narrower jobs-to-workers ratio.\n\nThe Fed focuses on the job market not just because of its implications on inflation, but also because the central bank is explicitly tasked by Congress to strive toward maximum employment. If the labor market unexpectedly weakens, then that could force the Fed to consider cutting rates, but Powell didn't sound concerned at all.\n\n\"We see gradual cooling, gradual moving toward a better balance,\" he said. \"We're monitoring it carefully for signs of something more than that, but we really don't see that.\"\n\nFirst rate cut in September?\n\nWall Street's best bet for the first rate cut is currently September, according to futures, and those odds improved markedly after the release of the May CPI. For that to happen, however, inflation will have to continue to drift lower in the coming months.\n\nOfficials frequently emphasize that they are \"data dependent\" and make conclusions about the economy after data stretching over several months reveal a trend. It's unclear if the factors that resulted in hotter-than-expected inflation readings earlier this year are still lurking in the background, but the May CPI provided some relief.\n\n\"The belief that components boosting inflation in the first quarter were not indicative of current cost pressures needed to be validated. May's report provides strong evidence on that front,\" Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody's Analytics, said in a note Wednesday. \"The Fed is banking it can wait a few more months until inflation falls further.\"\n\nThe US economy remains on strong footing for now, including the job market as employers continue to hire at a brisk pace. But it's unmistakable that some US consumers are under pressure. Still-high inflation is continuing to eat into some budgets, pandemic savings are drying up, borrowers continue to pile on more debt and the highest interest rates in nearly a quarter century are squeezing Americans.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Inflation overall was flat in May and a core price measure that excludes volatile food and energy items rose 0.2%, nudging down the annual increase to 3.4% from 3.6% the previous month, according to the consumer price index (CPI).\n\n\"We see today's report as progress and building confidence,\" Powell said. \"This is a step in the right direction but it really is only one reading.\" He added, \"We hope we get more like it.\"\n\nHow many rate cuts are expected in 2024?\n\nOfficials now estimate they'll lower the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 5% to 5.25% by year's end, according to their median estimate. That's equivalent to one quarter point cut, fewer than the three decreases they projected in March. Most economists expected the first cut in September.\n\nPolicymakers are divided, though, with eight predicting two cuts this year, seven foreseeing one and four looking for none, suggesting the median could change depending on how inflation evolves in coming months.\n\nOfficials expect four rate cuts next year and another four in 2026, more than they previously anticipated, a blueprint that would lower the key rate to 3.1% by the end of 2026. That's in line with their March estimate.\n\nRate cuts lower borrowing costs for consumers, stimulating the economy, and juice the stock market. In recent weeks, Fed officials have said they can be cautious as they weigh lower rates because inflation is still too high and the economy and job market are performing solidly despite nascent signs of a slowdown.\n\nWhat is the Fed interest rate today?\n\nThe Fed's decision to stand pat for now leaves its benchmark short-term interest rate at a 23-year high of 5.25% to 5.5%. That means Americans will keep paying higher mortgage, credit card, auto loan and other rates but will continue to benefit from more generous bank savings yields after years of meager returns.\n\nSince March 2022, the central bank has hiked the federal funds rate 11 times from near zero to corral a pandemic-induced inflation spike but it has left the rate unchanged since last July.\n\nAfter hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in mid-2022, annual inflation eased significantly last year as COVID-related product and labor shortages resolved. But progress stalled early this year in part because wage growth slowed more gradually, propping up price increases for services such as dining out and haircuts. Even some goods prices that had been falling moved higher.\n\nIn April, inflation showed signs of softening again but at a slower pace and Wednesday's CPI report showed the pullback gathered force last month. Although rent, the chief inflation driver, kept rising, auto insurance, which had been surging, dipped and airline fares fell 3.6%. Economists expect cost increases for rent, auto insurance and healthcare to downshift in the months ahead as delayed pandemic effects fade but it's uncertain how rapidly that will play out.\n\nWhat is inflation expected to be in 2024?\n\nFed officials estimate their preferred measure of annual inflation, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, will fall from 2.7% to 2.6% by December, above the 2.4% they predicted in March.\n\nA core PCE inflation reading that the Fed watches more closely is expected to hold steady at 2.8% by the end of the year, above the prior 2.6% estimate. Both overall inflation and the core measure are projected to fall to 2.3% by the end of 2025.\n\nWhat will happen to the economy in 2024?\n\nOn Wednesday, the Fed said it expects the economy to grow 2.1% this year, similar to the prior estimate. It predicts 2% growth in 2025.\n\nThe economy grew a sturdy 3.1% in 2023 (as measured from the fourth quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2023). But growth slowed to less than 2% annualized in the first quarter of this year as low- and middle-income households largely depleted COVID savings and built up massive credit card debt while incurring high delinquency rates,\n\nWill the job market slow down?\n\nThe current 4% unemployment rate is projected to end 2024 unchanged, in line with the March forecast, the Fed's median estimate shows. Monthly job growth has averaged a surprisingly robust 248,000 this year, in line with 2023's average. Although hiring has slowed, employers have been reluctant to lay off workers after enduring severe pandemic-related labor shortages but that benefit is expected to fade later this year, curtailing payroll gains.\n\nMeanwhile, average yearly wage growth has tumbled to 4.1% from 5.9% in March 2022 but rose from 4% in April. The Fed wants pay increases to come down to 3.5% to align with its 2% inflation target.\n\nWant to learn more? USA TODAY explains the news on interest rates. For more answers to your questions about today's report and other economic trends, keep reading:\n\nFed holds interest rates\n\nThe Fed on Wednesday kept its benchmark short-term interest rate unchanged at 5.25% to 5.5%, as seen in the chart below.\n\nThe FOMC is the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member branch of the Federal Reserve System that votes on interest rate decisions.\n\nThe committee includes the seven members of the Board of Governors at the Fed; the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; and four other Reserve Bank presidents who hold one-year terms on a rotating basis.\n\nHow will stocks react to the Fed announcement?\n\nStocks remain bullish, with more than two-thirds of S&P 500 stocks pointing upwards and half trading above their 50-day moving average, according to Liz Sonders, Schwab's chief investment strategist.\n\nBut underneath the surface, changes are afoot, analysts said.\n\n\"Higher inflation and interest rates have weighed on the outlook for consumer spending as excess savings have largely been spent,\" wrote LPL Financial strategists Adam Turnquist and Jeffrey Buchbinder in a report.\n\nIn contrast, industrials have benefitted from \"increased infrastructure spending, re-shoring activity, and defense spending,\" they said. \"Industrials are also a backdoor artificial intelligence (AI) play given their role in data center construction and maintenance.\"\n\nStocks soared at the opening bell Wednesday, pushing into record territory on the news that inflation is not rising.\n\nThe Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all surged in the minutes after the market opened, with the S&P and Nasdaq hitting all-time highs. All this over an inflation report that was downright boring: exactly what the market wanted. Inflation was essentially flat, with the annual rate rising 3.3% in May, compared with 3.4% in April.\n\nAs of 3:10 p.m. Eastern Time, the Dow was up 0.15%, the S&P had gained 1.1% and the Nasdaq was up 1.9%.\n\nIf the Fed looks like it's willing to cut rates on a mere forecast, rather than actual evidence, of inflation slowing to its 2% target, U.S. bond investors \"should worry,\" said Steven Ricchiuto, U.S. chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA.\n\n\"Sure, the Fed is itching to cut rates, but easing policy with a weak economy and a high level of joblessness is very different from the macro environment that the Fed is currently facing,\" he said. \"Although the domestic economy looks to be slowing back toward trend, the labor market remains tight, unit labor costs and wages are still rising faster than what is consistent with 2% inflation.\"\n\nIf inflation reaccelerates or stays high, bond yields will, too.\n\nCredit card interest rates are still climbing, even with the Fed on hold. The average annual percentage rate (ARP) on a new card in June notched the biggest monthly increase since November, rising to 24.80%, LendingTree said.\n\n\"Consumers need to understand that the cavalry isn't coming anytime soon, so the best thing you can do is take things into your own hands when it comes to lowering credit card interest rates,\" said Matt Schulz, LendingTree credit analyst.\n\n- Medora Lee\n\nHow can I manage credit card debt when rates are high?\n\nAccording to LendingTree credit analyst Matt Schulz, options include:\n\n- Medora Lee\n\nCould the Fed feel pressure to cut rates in step with Canada and Europe?\n\nLast week, the European Central Bank and Bank of Canada each lowered their key rates by a quarter point.\n\nDo those moves put the Fed under pressure to cut rates in the U.S.?\n\n\"Publicly, the Fed has to say there's no pressure, but privately, it might be a consideration,\" said Stephen Bittel, founder and chairman of Terranova Corporation, noting that businesses may head abroad to borrow at a cheaper rate.\n\nBut to safeguard consumer purchasing power, experts say, the Fed needs to stay focused on lowering inflation.\n\n\"The average person is going through hell,\" said David Lynd, chief executive at real estate company The Lynd Company. \"Inflation is ravaging the consumer. They're out of money, used up their credit cards, borrowing from mom and dad. There's not a lot left with inflation not going down.\"\n\nMinneapolis Fed President Neel Kasharki says consumers \"viscerally hate high inflation\" and prefer recession to inflation. \"High inflation affects everybody. There's no one I can lean on for help because everyone in my network is experiencing the same thing I'm experiencing.\"\n\nAnd there's still a risk that high inflation could persist. \"The economy has repeatedly surprised to the upside since the Fed stopped hiking and began forecasting cuts,\" said Steven Ricchiuto, U.S. chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA.\n\nThe Fed doesn't set mortgage rates, but what it does with the federal funds rate can influence them, along with the bond market and inflation.\n\n\"There's a good chance that we're going to need to get used to rates around 7% again, at least until we start getting better economic news,\" said Jacob Channel, senior economist at comparison site LendingTree. \"Unfortunately, this probably means that summer homebuying season is going to be expensive and difficult for many would-be buyers to navigate.\"\n\nThat shouldn't dissuade you from buying a home you love and can afford.\n\n\"If you spend too much time waiting for the 'perfect' conditions to arise, you could end up letting a lot of good opportunities go to waste,\" he said.\n\nYou can also refinance when rates drop, experts said.\n\nThe average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 7.38% on June 7. The average rate was 6.59% on a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage.\n\nBorrowers' rates\u202fon auto loans are mostly based on factors like credit background, vehicle price, down payment and the lender's borrowing costs and risks. Fed rate moves have only a small effect.\n\nStill, interest rates on new and used car loans are elevated, hampering car sales, analysts said.\n\nIn the first three months of the year, the average APR for new vehicles was 7.1%, marking the fifth consecutive quarter this figure has remained above 7%, while used-vehicle APRs rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 11.7% from the end of last year, car comparison site Edmunds said.\n\nEven the return of new-vehicle incentives isn't enough to combat steadily high interest rates and climbing negative equity, said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' head of insights. Negative equity means your car's value is less than what you paid. Negative equity on trade-ins reached an all-time average high of $6,167 this year, she said.\n\nThe 2025 COLA adjustment eased along with inflation, following an uptick earlier this year. But the increase probably lowballs what seniors will need to keep up with inflation, said Mary Johnson, a retired analyst for the nonprofit Senior Citizens League who tracks and calculates COLA estimates.\n\nThe consumer price index (CPI), a broad measure of goods and services costs, rose 3.3% in May from a year earlier. That's down from 3.4% in April.\n\nThe Social Security cost-of-living adjustment is based on the \"consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers,\" or CPI-W. That figure dipped to 3.3% from April's 3.4%, but it still outpaced the 3.2% COLA Social Security recipients began receiving in January.\n\n- Medora Lee\n\nCOLA estimate: Social Security COLA estimate dips, but seniors remain in a hole. Here's why.\n\nWhen did the Fed last cut interest rates?\n\nA lot has happened in the last three years. But not a lot of interest rate cuts.\n\nFor months now, market forecasters have wondered when the Federal Reserve would step in to reduce interest rates. But the Fed hasn't budged. The benchmark rate stands at a target range of 5.25% to 5.5%, where it has been since July: Nearly a year.\n\nThe last time the Fed actually cut interest rates was in March 2020, at the peak of the pandemic. In an emergency meeting on March 14 and 15, the Fed moved to trim its target rate by a full percentage point, from a range of 1%-1.25% to a range of 0-0.25%: Effectively, zero.\n\nThe next time the Fed acted on interest rates was two years later, almost to the day, in a meeting on March 15 and 16, 2022. Worried about rising inflation, the panel ordered a quarter-point increase, to a target range of 0.25% to 0.50%.\n\nIt's been all uphill from there. In a series of meetings between that March and July 2023, the Fed pushed interest rates up five full points, setting them at their current level.\n\n- Daniel de Vis\u00e9\n\nThe economy: At 3.3%, inflation remains too high for Fed. What economic data are saying, too\n\nToday's mortgage rates\n\nWhile the Fed's recent campaign of interest-rate hikes doesn't directly affect mortgage rates, the increases have rippled through the economy and made the math more difficult for homebuyers.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the average annual percentage rate (APR) for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 7.50%. That rate was about the same as a month ago, but much higher than the mortgage rates we saw between 2010 and early 2022.\n\nLate last year, mortgage rates reached a peak of 7.79%. At that rate, new buyers were paying $2,877 in principle and interest on a $400,000 mortgage, according to Bankrate's mortgage calculator. That's more than $1,000 higher than payments on a similar mortgage before the Fed started battling inflation.\n\nMortgage rates are up from the beginning of the year and well above the 10-year median.\n\nNot surprisingly, as mortgage rates have risen, existing home sales have tumbled. At the same time, average home prices are rising, because fewer homes are on the market. According to economists, homeowners with mortgage rates of 3% or lower are understandably reluctant to give them up.\n\nThe U.S. unemployment rate rose to 4% in May. The monthly number, which represents the percentage of people who are unemployed and looking for work, ticked up from 3.9% in April.\n\nThe unemployment rate is rising slowly, which could suggest that employers are pulling back on hiring. Still, the rate remains below the 10-year monthly median rate of 4.3%. The job market had been on a similar roll in 2020 before the pandemic put millions out of work.\n\nThe U.S. economy produced $22.7 trillion of goods on an inflation-adjusted, annualized basis in the first quarter of 2024. That activity pushed up GDP by 1.3% - recently adjusted down from 1.6% - from the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nIn other words, the U.S. economy is still growing, but not at a very brisk pace. Some have speculated the Fed's campaign of interest-rate increases may be starting to weigh on businesses and consumers. Another factor is a spike in imports, reflecting Americans' purchases from overseas producers.\n\nThe annual inflation rate seems to be stalled in the range of 3% to 3.5%, a space it has occupied since the start of the year. And while that figure isn't particularly high, it's higher than the 2% rate the Federal Reserve has set as a goal.\n\nWhy does inflation remain elevated?\n\nOne of the \"uncontrollable\" inflation components is rent, which remains high and accounts for about one-third of the basket of goods and services used to calculate the consumer price index, said Stephen Bittel, founder and chairman of Terranova Corporation, an alternative investment firm specializing in commercial real estate.\n\nLast month, at a conference in Amsterdam, Fed Chair Jerome Powell called housing inflation \"a bit of a puzzle.\" Measures of new apartment leases show rents barely increasing.\n\nFriday's surprisingly strong jobs report, coupled with a 4.1% year-over-year jump in wages, \"should drive a rebound in consumer spending,\" said Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic. That trend, too, \"could help keep inflation more buoyant,\" she said, further delaying the timeline of any interest rate cuts by the Fed.\n\n- Medora Lee\n\nHow will inflation news affect the Fed's interest rate decision?\n\nWednesday's inflation report should come as welcome news to the Federal Reserve, analysts and forecasters said.\n\nInflation was essentially flat in May, defying fears of an overheated economy.\n\n\"As we hear from the Fed later today, today's inflation data should be another feather in the cap for Chairman Powell and raise the confidence for the rest of the voting members,\" said Charlie Ripley, Senior Investment Strategist for Allianz Investment Management. \"More importantly, as we look further out on the calendar, the distance from here to the first rate cut of the cycle appears to be rapidly approaching.\"\n\nBut analysts cautioned that the new inflation report was hardly definitive.\n\n\"Overall, today's inflation numbers will be a welcome sight for the Fed, though certainly not enough to push them to cut rates,\" said Elizabeth Renter, a data analyst at NerdWallet, the personal finance site.\n\n\"The Fed will be glad to see inflation slow in this report,\" said Bill Adams, Chief Economist for Comerica Bank. \"But they will wait for clearer progress toward their inflation target before they start cutting interest rates.\"\n\nComerica's forecast has the Fed holding interest rates steady today, and again at its next meeting in July, then cutting rates in September, with another likely cut in December: two in all.\n\nAfter today's meeting, the Federal Reserve has four more chances to act on interest rates this year. The panel meets every month or two.\n\nWhen will inflation cool enough for the Fed to cut interest rates?\n\nThe Fed's benchmark, short-term interest rate has stood at a 23-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% since July, as the Fed waits for inflation to cool.\n\nAnnual inflation dipped to 3.3% in May from 3.4% in April - far below the peak of 9.1% in June 2022, but still above the Fed's 2% goal.\n\nOdds are slim for a rate cut this summer. Yet, futures markets are still betting on one cut this year, probably in September, as inflation retreats, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, which measures market expectations for changes in the benchmark rate.\n\nAs recently as March, the median forecast called for three rate cuts this year. Fed officials have since acknowledged that inflation has been surprisingly slow to drop, and economists expect the panel to pencil in fewer rate cuts. But one cut, or two? It will be a close call.\n\nThe May consumer price index (CPI) is out, coming just hours before the Fed's meeting ends, and new inflation data could influence the Fed's rate cut forecasts.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics released May's consumer price index Wednesday morning. For the month, inflation, as measured by the CPI, was unchanged when seasonally adjusted. The annual inflation rate fell slightly to 3.3%.\n\nThus, while inflation isn't spiking, the annual rate appears stuck above 3%. That's more than a full percentage point above where Fed officials want to see it, and another sign that borrowing costs will remain elevated.\n\nThe inflation report \"could influence the tone\" of the Fed meeting, wrote Deutsche Bank chief economist Matthew Luzzetti, in a note. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's \"comments on inflation will no doubt reflect the May CPI data released that morning.\"\n\nAlmost no one expects the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates when officials conclude their two-day meeting Wednesday. But economists and investors will be looking for clues about when the central bank finally might cut its key rate, and how many times it might do so this year.\n\nComing into the year, many economists predicted rates would already be falling. They expected as many as six or seven rate cuts this year.\n\nBut inflation endures, and at this point, most economists have scaled back their rate cut predictions to two, one or none in 2024. A few experts, including Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, have even suggested a rate hike probably won't happen at all.\n\nInterest rates are the main tool the Fed uses to combat inflation. High rates make borrowing more expensive, which slows spending and the economy, generally easing overall price hikes.", "source": {"uri": "eu.poconorecord.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pocono

The downgrade in their outlook for rate cuts would mean that such borrowing costs would likely stay higher for longer, a disappointment for potential homebuyers and others.\n\nStill, the Fed's quarterly projections of future interest rate cuts are by no means fixed in time. The policymakers frequently revise their plans for rate cuts -- or hikes -- depending on how economic growth and inflation measures evolve over time.\n\nBut if borrowing costs remain high in the coming months, they could also have consequences for the presidential race. Though the unemployment rate is a low four percent, hiring is robust and consumers continue to spend, voters have taken a generally sour view of the economy under President Joe Biden. In large part, that's because prices remain much higher than they were before the pandemic struck. High borrowing rates impose a further financial burden.\n\nThe Fed's updated economic forecasts, which it will issue Wednesday afternoon, will likely be influenced by the government's May inflation data being released in the morning. The inflation report is expected to show that consumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs -- so-called core inflation -- rose 0.3 percent from April to May. That would be the same as in the previous month and higher than Fed officials would prefer to see.\n\nOverall inflation, held down by falling gas prices, is thought to have edged up just 0.1 percent. Measured from a year earlier, consumer prices are projected to have risen 3.4 percent in May, the same as in April.\n\nInflation had fallen steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could achieve a \"soft landing,\" whereby it would manage to conquer inflation through rate hikes without causing a recession. Such an outcome is difficult and rare.\n\nUnexpectedly high\n\nBut inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and potentially imperiling a soft landing.\n\nIn early May, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its target before it would reduce its benchmark rate.\n\nPowell noted that it would likely take more time to gain that confidence than Fed officials had previously thought. / AP", "source": {"uri": "sunstar.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sun.Star Network Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@sunstar.com.ph", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images.assettype.com/sunstar/2023-10/2de1a36d-f1c1-464d-b87a-78dd2f88f888/logotest900px.svg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

That was the mildest such increase in three years.\n\nFed officials are scrutinizing each month's inflation data to assess their progress in their fight against rising prices. Even as overall inflation moderates, such necessities as groceries, rent and health care are much pricier than they were three years ago -- a continuing source of public discontent and a political threat to President Joe Biden's re-election bid.\n\nMost other measures suggest that the economy is healthy: Unemployment remains low, hiring is robust and consumers are traveling, eating out and spending on entertainment.\n\nWednesday's report suggested that consumers are beginning to get some relief from the price spikes of the past three years. Grocery costs were unchanged, on average, from April to May, after actually falling 0.2% the previous month. Food prices have risen just 1% over the past 12 months, though they're still up about 20% from three years ago.\n\nAverage gas prices tumbled 3.6% nationally just from April to May, though they're 2.2% higher than they were a year earlier. Those declines have continued, with gas averaging $3.45 a gallon Wednesday, down 17 cents from a month ago. Americans didn't drive as much over the Memorial Day weekend as they have in previous years, reducing demand, and oil prices have fallen.\n\nOverall inflation also slowed last month, with consumer prices unchanged from April to May.\n\nMeasured from a year earlier, prices rose 3.3%, less than the 3.6% increase a month earlier.\n\n\"It's certainly welcome news,\" said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at PGIM Fixed Income. \"It drives home that the inflation challenge in the United States is not as challenging as monetary policy makers believe.\"\n\nAirfares, furniture and clothing also dropped in price last month, helping keep inflation in check. And the cost of auto insurance, which has soared in recent months, actually dipped from April to May, though it's still up more than 20% from a year earlier.\n\nThe Fed has kept its key rate unchanged for nearly a year after having rapidly raised it in 2022 and 2023 to fight the worst bout of inflation in four decades. Those higher rates have led, in turn, to more expensive mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other forms of consumer and business borrowing.\n\nThough inflation is now far below its peak of 9.1% in mid-2022, it remains above the Fed's target level.\n\nPersistently elevated inflation has posed a vexing challenge for the Fed, which raises interest rates -- or keeps them high -- to try to slow borrowing and spending, cool the economy and ease the pace of price increases.\n\nThe longer the Fed keeps borrowing costs high, the more it risks weakening the economy too much and causing a recession. Yet if it cuts rates too soon, it risks reigniting inflation. Most of the policymakers have said they think their rate policies are slowing growth and should curb inflation over time.\n\nInflation had fallen steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could pull off a \"soft landing,\" whereby it manages to conquer inflation through higher interest rates without causing a recession. Such an outcome is difficult and rare.\n\nBut inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and possibly imperiling a soft landing.\n\nIn early May, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its target before it would reduce its benchmark rate.

That was down from 0.3% the previous month and was the smallest increase since October.

Measured from a year earlier, consumer prices rose 3.3%, less than the 3.6% increase a month earlier.\n\nThe cost of auto insurance, which has soared in recent months, actually dipped from April to May, though it's still up more than 20% from a year earlier. Grocery prices were unchanged last month, after declining slightly in April. They're now up just 1% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe Fed has kept its key rate unchanged for nearly a year after having rapidly raised it in 2022 and 2023 to fight the worst bout of inflation in four decades. Those higher rates have led, in turn, to more expensive mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other forms of consumer and business borrowing. Though inflation is now far below its peak of 9.1% in mid-2022, it remains above the Fed's target level.\n\nPersistently elevated inflation has posed a vexing challenge for the Fed, which raises interest rates - or keeps them high - to try to slow borrowing and spending, cool the economy and ease the pace of price increases.\n\nThe longer the Fed keeps borrowing costs high, the more it risks weakening the economy too much and causing a recession.

Several Fed officials have said in recent weeks that they needed to see several consecutive months of lower inflation.\n\nSome signs suggest that inflation will continue to cool in the coming months.

Powell noted that it would likely take more time to gain that confidence than Fed officials had previously thought. Several officials have said in recent weeks that they needed to see several consecutive months of lower inflation.\n\nIn addition to declining gas prices, economists have estimated that prices for several other items fell from April to May, including clothing, furniture and new cars. Though used cars are projected to have risen in price after falling for several months, that may prove a temporary blip.\n\nThe cost of apartment rents, a key driver of inflation, could cool slightly. And auto insurance is thought to have risen by a sharp 1% just from April to May, according to economists at Goldman Sachs, though that would be down from increases of 1.8% and 2.6% in the previous two months.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_landing_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soft landing (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Car finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furniture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Furniture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/CikK0GxiEw9H6bKa9PHHnnIryBk=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/I6TZNUPELGOQHGRAP56GQS5SIA.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The Fed aggressively raised rates in 2022 and 2023 after inflation surged to a 40-year peak.\n\nThe personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, has declined from a 7.1% peak annual pace in June 2022 to 2.7% as of April. The current policy rate is regarded as restrictive enough to discourage investment and spending and gradually return inflation to the Fed's target.\n\nYet policymakers are not ready to commit to any cuts until they've seen more progress. Just as they acknowledge risks that unemployment could rise fast and warrant rate cuts to support the economy, they see aspects of inflation, particularly in housing and the broad services sector, that may have stalled at too high a level.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters expect the consumer price index rose only 0.1% in May, which would be the weakest reading since October, with \"core\" prices excluding food and energy forecast to increase 0.3%. The U.S. Labor Department is due to release the CPI report at 8:30 a.m. EDT.\n\nWhile the year-over-year CPI rates are expected to show no or little change from April, the report's details should be seen \"as a step in the right direction,\" after inflation surged more than expected earlier in 2024, BNP Paribas economists wrote.\n\nIn their final comments before the latest policy meeting, a number of central bank officials, including Fed Governor Christopher Waller, said they needed to see several more months of improving inflation data before deciding to cut rates, statements investors have construed as pushing back any rate reduction to the Fed's Sept. 17-18 meeting at the earliest.\n\nEven that start date for the policy easing is a virtual toss-up. As of Tuesday, there was less than a 51% likelihood of a U.S. rate cut in September, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n\nReporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Paul Simao\n\nHoward Schneider\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nCovers the U.S. Federal Reserve, monetary policy and the economy, a graduate of the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University with previous experience as a foreign correspondent, economics reporter and on the local staff of the Washington Post.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [{"uri": "howard_schneider@reuters.com", "name": "Howard Schneider", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_consumption_expenditures_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal consumption expenditures price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Waller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Waller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Massachusetts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Massachusetts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maryland,_College_Park", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Maryland, College Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johns Hopkins University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNP_Paribas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BNP Paribas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomson Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZUSPU3XWZRIBHJFRCZLLMYOCBI.jpg?auth=cba9d361f2928eef98ba18dc52fd4a9071d023611b5d385a0d74fd5339d0c376&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-17", "dateEnd": "-09-18", "textStart": 3729, "textEnd": 3740}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 12, "textEnd": 19}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The trend, if it holds, could move the Federal Reserve closer to cutting its benchmark interest rate from its 23-year peak.\n\nConsumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs -- the closely watched \"core\" index -- rose 0.2% from April to May, the government said Wednesday. That was down from 0.3% the previous month and was the smallest increase since October. Measured from a year earlier, core prices climbed 3.4%, below last month's 3.6% rise. That was the mildest such increase in three years.\n\nFed officials are scrutinizing each month's inflation data to assess their progress in their fight against rising prices. Even as overall inflation moderates, such necessities as groceries, rent and health care are much pricier than they were three years ago -- a continuing source of public discontent and a political threat to President Joe Biden's re-election bid. Most other measures suggest that the economy is healthy: Unemployment remains low, hiring is robust and consumers are traveling, eating out and spending on entertainment.\n\nWednesday's report suggested that consumers are beginning to get some relief from the price spikes of the past three years. Grocery costs were unchanged, on average, from April to May, after actually falling 0.2% the previous month. Food prices have risen just 1% over the past 12 months, though they're still up about 20% from three years ago.\n\nAverage gas prices tumbled 3.6% nationally just from April to May, though they're 2.2% higher than they were a year earlier. Those declines have continued, with gas averaging $3.45 a gallon Wednesday, down 17 cents from a month ago. Americans didn't drive as much over the Memorial Day weekend as they have in previous years, reducing demand, and oil prices have fallen.\n\nOverall inflation also slowed last month, with consumer prices unchanged from April to May. Measured from a year earlier, prices rose 3.3%, less than the 3.6% increase a month earlier.\n\n\"It's certainly welcome news,\" said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at PGIM Fixed Income. \"It drives home that the inflation challenge in the United States is not as challenging as monetary policy makers believe.\"\n\nAirfares, furniture and clothing also dropped in price last month, helping keep inflation in check. And the cost of auto insurance, which has soared in recent months, actually dipped from April to May, though it's still up more than 20% from a year earlier.\n\nThe Fed has kept its key rate unchanged for nearly a year after having rapidly raised it in 2022 and 2023 to fight the worst bout of inflation in four decades. Those higher rates have led, in turn, to more expensive mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other forms of consumer and business borrowing. Though inflation is now far below its peak of 9.1% in mid-2022, it remains above the Fed's target level.\n\nPersistently elevated inflation has posed a vexing challenge for the Fed, which raises interest rates -- or keeps them high -- to try to slow borrowing and spending, cool the economy and ease the pace of price increases.\n\nThe longer the Fed keeps borrowing costs high, the more it risks weakening the economy too much and causing a recession. Yet if it cuts rates too soon, it risks reigniting inflation. Most of the policymakers have said they think their rate policies are slowing growth and should curb inflation over time.\n\nInflation had fallen steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could pull off a \"soft landing,\" whereby it manages to conquer inflation through higher interest rates without causing a recession. Such an outcome is difficult and rare.\n\nBut inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and possibly imperiling a soft landing.\n\nIn early May, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its target before it would reduce its benchmark rate. Several Fed officials have said in recent weeks that they needed to see several consecutive months of lower inflation.\n\nSome signs suggest that inflation will continue to cool in the coming months. Americans, particularly lower-income households, are pulling back on their spending. In response, several major retail and restaurant chains, including Walmart, Target, Walgreen's, McDonald's and Burger King, have responded by announcing price cuts or deals.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000.

In turn, the central bank said on Wednesday that it expects inflation to remain higher for longer than previously anticipated.\n\nThe Fed retreated from its previous forecast of three rate cuts this year, instead saying that it anticipates one rate cut in 2024.\n\n\"The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent,\" The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making body on interest rates, said in a statement.\n\nAt seven consecutive meetings spanning nearly a year, the Fed has opted to hold rates steady in response to elevated inflation and robust economic performance.\n\nIn theory, the prolonged stretch of high interest rates should weigh on economic activity, reduce consumer demand and cut prices. Instead, a resilient economy and stubborn inflation have largely defied the Fed's efforts.\n\nInflation has fallen significantly from a peak of 9.1%, but price increases have barely budged in recent months and remain more than a percentage point higher than the Fed's target rate of 2%.\n\nMORE: Skyrocketing child care costs show how inflation could impact 2024 election\n\nThe Fed has all but abandoned a previous forecast of three interest rate cuts by the end of the year.\n\nSome observers expect the Fed to forgo interest rate cuts for the remainder of 2024.\n\nRoger Aliaga-Diaz, chief economist at the investment giant Vanguard, said in a statement to ABC News before the rate announcement that he believed the Fed would keep interest rates at current levels for at least the next six months.\n\nThe forecast, Aliaga-Diaz added, owes to \"inadequate progress in the inflation fight and continued growth and labor momentum.\"\n\nIn a note to clients, Deutsche Bank echoed skepticism about rate cuts anytime soon. \"Fed officials have clearly signaled that they are in a wait-and-see mode with respect to the timing and magnitude of rate cuts,\" the note said.\n\nThe Fed risks a rebound of inflation if it cuts interest rates too quickly, since stronger consumer demand on top of solid economic activity could lead to an acceleration of price increases.\n\nA prolonged period of high interest rates, however, threatens to place downward pressure on economic growth and plunge the U.S. into a recession.\n\nA jobs report released on Friday blew past economist expectations, demonstrating the resilient strength of the economy. Blockbuster hiring in May exceeded the average number of jobs added each month over the previous year, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said.\n\nAverage hourly wages surged 4.1% over the year ending in May, the report found. That rate of pay increase exceeds the pace of inflation, indicating that the spending power of workers has grown even as prices jump.\n\nThe data marks a boon for workers but could give pause to policymakers, since they fear that a rise in pay could prompt businesses to raise prices in order to cover the added labor cost.\n\nMORE: Target, McDonald's and Wendy's announce discounts.

On Wednesday, June 12, 2024, the Labor Department issues its report on prices at the consumer level in May. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)\n\nInflation in the United States eased in May for a second straight month, a hopeful sign that a pickup in prices that occurred early this year may have passed. The trend, if it holds, could move the Federal Reserve closer to cutting its benchmark interest rate from its 23-year peak.\n\nConsumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs -- the closely watched \"core\" index -- rose 0.2% from April to May, the government said Wednesday. That was down from 0.3% the previous month and was the smallest increase since October. Measured from a year earlier, core prices climbed 3.4%, below last month's 3.6% rise. That was the mildest such increase in three years.\n\nFed officials are scrutinizing each month's inflation data to assess their progress in their fight against rising prices. Even as overall inflation moderates, such necessities as groceries, rent and health care are much pricier than they were three years ago -- a continuing source of public discontent and a political threat to President Joe Biden's re-election bid. Most other measures suggest that the economy is healthy: Unemployment remains low, hiring is robust and consumers are traveling, eating out and spending on entertainment.\n\nWednesday's report suggested that consumers are beginning to get some relief from the price spikes of the past three years. Grocery costs were unchanged, on average, from April to May, after actually falling 0.2% the previous month. Food prices have risen just 1% over the past 12 months, though they're still up about 20% from three years ago.\n\nAverage gas prices tumbled 3.6% nationally just from April to May, though they're 2.2% higher than they were a year earlier. Those declines have continued, with gas averaging $3.45 a gallon Wednesday, down 17 cents from a month ago. Americans didn't drive as much over the Memorial Day weekend as they have in previous years, reducing demand, and oil prices have fallen.\n\nOverall inflation also slowed last month, with consumer prices unchanged from April to May. Measured from a year earlier, prices rose 3.3%, less than the 3.6% increase a month earlier.\n\n\"It's certainly welcome news,\" said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at PGIM Fixed Income. \"It drives home that the inflation challenge in the United States is not as challenging as monetary policy makers believe.\"\n\nAirfares, furniture and clothing also dropped in price last month, helping keep inflation in check. And the cost of auto insurance, which has soared in recent months, actually dipped from April to May, though it's still up more than 20% from a year earlier.\n\nThe Fed has kept its key rate unchanged for nearly a year after having rapidly raised it in 2022 and 2023 to fight the worst bout of inflation in four decades. Those higher rates have led, in turn, to more expensive mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other forms of consumer and business borrowing. Though inflation is now far below its peak of 9.1% in mid-2022, it remains above the Fed's target level.\n\nPersistently elevated inflation has posed a vexing challenge for the Fed, which raises interest rates -- or keeps them high -- to try to slow borrowing and spending, cool the economy and ease the pace of price increases.\n\nThe longer the Fed keeps borrowing costs high, the more it risks weakening the economy too much and causing a recession. Yet if it cuts rates too soon, it risks reigniting inflation. Most of the policymakers have said they think their rate policies are slowing growth and should curb inflation over time.\n\nInflation had fallen steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could pull off a \"soft landing,\" whereby it manages to conquer inflation through higher interest rates without causing a recession. Such an outcome is difficult and rare.\n\nBut inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and possibly imperiling a soft landing.\n\nIn early May, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its target before it would reduce its benchmark rate. Several Fed officials have said in recent weeks that they needed to see several consecutive months of lower inflation.\n\nSome signs suggest that inflation will continue to cool in the coming months. Americans, particularly lower-income households, are pulling back on their spending.

That is a more positive assessment than after the Fed's previous meeting May 1, when the officials said there \"has been a lack of further progress\" on inflation.\n\nThe news from the central bank comes hours after a report showing that inflation cooled in May, signaling an easing of consumer price pressures.\n\n\"Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated,\" the statement reads. \"In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.\"\n\nThe policymakers, as expected, kept their key rate unchanged at roughly 5.3%.

The Fed said that 8 of those officials projected two cuts, 7 projected one, and four said they expect no cuts at all this year.", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Car finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/jerome_powell_AP_24031706402001_NAT_0131", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 674, "textEnd": 679}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

A rally in Treasuries sent two-year yields down as much as 17 basis points as the US dollar dropped against all of its developed-world peers. Fed swaps now fully price in quarter-point rate cut in November -- and bets on a September reduction also rose.\n\nJust hours away from the Fed decision, the core consumer price index -- which excludes food and energy costs -- rose 3.4%, cooling to the slowest pace in more than three years. The figures may represent the early stages of inflation resuming a downward trend that would allow officials to cut rates this year.\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to hold its benchmark rate steady for a seventh consecutive meeting Wednesday. The rate decision, and the projections, will be released at 2 p.m. in Washington. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference 30 minutes later.\n\nWall Street's Reaction to CPI:\n\nA September rate cut is very much back in play. This report is exactly what the Fed needed to increase its confidence that inflation is subsiding and rate cuts are warranted in the months ahead.\n\nThe story isn't over, since the Fed has said it wants to see an established trend of falling inflation before it lowers rates. But a September cut is still in play -- as long as we get more numbers like this one.\n\nThe Fed will be breathing a sigh of relief after CPI inflation surprised to the downside for the first time this year in May.\n\nWe think this print starts the clock on a potential September rate cut, but the Fed will need to see much more sustained progress in the months ahead to deliver that cut and will try to underline that point at its June meeting today - something markets should be prepared for.\n\nToday's CPI report was the sort of news the Fed has been anxiously waiting for since beginning its tightening program in 2022. Attention will now shift to the FOMC's updated dot plot. Altogether, this report probably shifts the focus back to two or three rate cuts in 2024.\n\nAs we hear from the Fed later today, today's inflation data should be another feather in the cap for Chairman Powell and raise the confidence for the rest of the voting members. More importantly, as we look further out on the calendar, the distance from here to the first rate cut of the cycle appears to be rapidly approaching.\n\nUS inflation has proven sticker than anticipated so far in 2024, so today's print will be welcomed by the market. That said, it may be premature to extrapolate this single data point and we would expect the Fed to continue to exert caution, with the prospect of limited rate cuts over the remainder of this year. Ongoing data will continue to be scrutinised as the underlying economic picture emerges.\n\nThe cool inflation numbers should boost investor confidence for a Fed rate cut in the second half of 2024, but will the Fed throw gasoline or cold water on the fire when it comes to rate cuts?\n\nToday's inflation report is a step in the right direction as investors look for clues from Chair Powell on what the Fed's next steps might be.\n\nThe Fed's last mile toward price stability is getting shorter.\n\nThis should help the FOMC, today preparing its dot plot and fine tuning its statement, offer a more positive view regarding monetary easing despite invoking their well-practiced reminder that they remain data dependent and require additional confirmation that inflation continues to trend lower.\n\nSofter inflation is good news for the Federal Reserve. Despite a good report this morning, the Fed will still likely communicate this afternoon their intentions to keep rates higher for longer in their updated summary of economic projections. The updated dot plot will likely signal only two rate cuts this year, a change from the three cuts communicated back in March.\n\nDisinflation is back -- the bump up in inflation data over the past few months is proving to be temporary. That makes life so much easier for the Federal Reserve: employment is strong, and inflation is dropping.\n\nInflation is slowing even as the economy accelerates. Things are playing out as the Fed hoped, so Jerome Powell will probably be feeling good this afternoon. September could be back in play for a rate cut. The bears have nowhere to run to and nowhere to hide.\n\nMay CPI was softer than expected across headline and core readings, indicating the disinflation process is playing out. This keeps the Fed on track for cuts in 2024, with the first cut likely coming in September, especially with the unemployment rate at 4% and risk of going higher.\n\nDisinflation strikes back. While these figures are unlikely to influence today's Fed decision, they could be significant for the July meeting. Expectations of lower rates should bolster equities and bonds.\n\nToday's soft CPI puts the Fed back in the driver's seat to steer towards a precautionary cut later this year to ensure recession remains remote. Until greater disinflation evidence is seen both in breadth and depth, today's softness is supportive of a preemptive cut rather than a pivot in Fed policy towards accommodation.\n\nOverall, it was a universally softer read on inflation than the market was expecting. Moreover, it clears the path for the 'dot plot' to signal 50 bp of cuts in 2024 and ensures that Powell will offer a dovish tone.\n\nThis fall provides evidence that monetary policy is having its intended effect and brings the economy one step closer to the Fed's target of 2%. If inflation drops consistently in the coming months, central bankers should be convinced to finally reduce interest rates.\n\nChances of a 2024 rate cut remain balanced. Inflation is certainly not raising, but neither is it falling fast. With a strong and healthy job market, the Fed can stick to its historical playbook and keep rates well above CPI.\n\nA calm CPI report. This CPI report gives the Fed the flexibility to still cut rates. We still expect the Fed to hold off until after the election though.\n\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.", "source": {"uri": "swissinfo.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "SWI swissinfo.ch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "swi_swissinfo_ch@swissinfo.ch", "name": "Swi Swissinfo.Ch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_plot_(statistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dot plot (statistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Treasury security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Consumer Price Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disinflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_stability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price stability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quantitative easing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/wp-content/uploads/swissinfo-theme/swi-fallback-featured-image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Despite acknowledging slight progress towards their 2% inflation target, officials now predict only one rate cut for the year, reflecting a cautious approach. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the need for further economic confidence to reduce rates.\n\nThe Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday and pushed out the start of rate cuts to perhaps as late as December, with officials projecting only a single quarter-percentage-point reduction for the year amid rising estimates for what it will take to keep inflation in check. In a set of projections that likely removes the prospect of a reduction in borrowing costs before the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election, Fed officials repositioned from expecting three quarter-percentage-point reductions in March to just the one despite an acknowledgement in the U.S. central bank's new policy statement of \"modest further progress\" towards its 2% inflation target - an upgrade from its May 1 statement.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell, speaking at a press conference following the end of the two-day policy meeting, said that combination reflected a \"conservative\" outlook for inflation among policymakers. Even as \"more recent monthly readings have eased somewhat,\" that is not yet enough to instill \"greater confidence\" in inflation returning sustainably toward 2%. \"It's only one reading,\" Powell said of a Labor Department report earlier on Wednesday showing the\n\nconsumer price index eased last month more than expected.\n\n\"When we are (more confident), then we can look at loosening policy,\" Powell said. The shift among policymakers also coincided with an increase to 2.8% in the estimated long-run, or \"neutral,\" rate of interest from 2.6%, which indicates policymakers have concluded the economy needs more restraint to finish the battle against rising prices.\n\nRecent progress has been slow, and Fed officials now project a slightly higher end-of-year inflation rate of 2.6% versus the 2.4% anticipated as of March. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite stock indices held onto gains on the day, while the U.S. dollar and U.S. Treasury yields remained lower. Traders of rate futures continued to price in the possibility that the Fed's rate-cutting cycle could start in September, and a second reduction was still seen as probable by the end of the year.\n\n\"The market cares more than the economy does about whether there are two cuts this year or only one,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"The Fed is basically rearranging the rate-cut deck chairs.\" While rate cuts are now seen getting a likely later start and proceeding at a slower pace this year than investors have anticipated, the Fed's policy rate is seen falling fast next year, with reductions of a full percentage point in both 2025 and 2026.\n\nThe Fed's statement and new Summary of Economic Projections show a central bank wrestling over how to respond to data that many read as pointing to slower inflation - consumer prices in fact did not rise at all in May on a month-over-month basis, according to data released on Wednesday - but also to steady growth and job creation. HIGHER NEUTRAL RATE\n\nThe new projections show the economy is still expected to grow at a slightly above-trend 2.1% this year despite a sluggish first quarter, and the unemployment rate will remain at its current 4% through the year. \"Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Job gains have remained strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low,\" the Fed said in a statement that was approved unanimously.\n\nFollowing little progress on inflation over the first months of the year, the result was a \"dot plot\" of projected policymaker interest rate forecasts that involved nearly an across-the-board shift higher in the rates considered needed to finish the battle against inflation. Coupled with recent debate over the possibility that the neutral rate of interest was higher than estimated, the new dot plot suggested Fed officials have concluded higher rates are needed over a longer period of time to keep inflation in check. Summed with a previous increase in the March projection, that neutral rate is now estimated at more than a quarter of a percentage point above where it ended 2023.\n\nThe Fed aggressively raised rates in 2022 and 2023 in response to a surge in inflation that peaked at a 40-year high some two years ago.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq_Composite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq Composite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_plot_(statistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dot plot (statistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Travel", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/28_05_2024_13_02_51_5644752.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 753, "textEnd": 759}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 1055, "textEnd": 1060}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

On Wednesday, June 12, 2024, the Labor Department issues its report on prices at the consumer level in May.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Inflation in the United States eased last month in a hopeful sign that a pickup in prices that occurred early this year may have passed. The trend, if it holds, could move the Federal Reserve closer to cutting its benchmark interest rate from its 23-year peak.\n\nConsumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs -- the closely watched \"core\" index -- rose 0.2% from April to May, the government said Wednesday. That was down from 0.3% the previous month and was the smallest increase since October. Measured from a year earlier, core prices rose 3.4%, below last month's 3.6% increase.\n\nFed officials are scrutinizing each month's inflation data to assess their progress in their fight against rising prices. Even as overall inflation moderates, such necessities as groceries, rent and health care are much pricier than they were three years ago -- a continuing source of public discontent and a political threat to President Joe Biden's re-election bid. Most other measures suggest that the economy is healthy: Unemployment remains low, hiring is robust and consumers are traveling, eating out and spending on entertainment.\n\nThe Fed has kept its key rate unchanged for nearly a year after having rapidly raised it in 2022 and 2023 to fight the worst bout of inflation in four decades. Those higher rates have led, in turn, to more expensive mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other forms of consumer and business borrowing. Though inflation is now far below its peak of 9.1% in mid-2022, it remains above the Fed's target level.\n\nPersistently elevated inflation has posed a vexing challenge for the Fed, which raises interest rates -- or keeps them high -- to try to slow borrowing and spending, cool the economy and ease the pace of price increases.\n\nThe longer the Fed keeps borrowing costs high, the more it risks weakening the economy too much and causing a recession. Yet if it cuts rates too soon, it risks reigniting inflation. Most of the policymakers have said they think their rate policies are slowing growth and should curb inflation over time.\n\nInflation had fallen steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could pull off a \"soft landing,\" whereby it manages to conquer inflation through higher interest rates without causing a recession. Such an outcome is difficult and rare.\n\nBut inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and possibly imperiling a soft landing.\n\nIn early May, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its target before it would reduce its benchmark rate. Several Fed officials have said in recent weeks that they needed to see several consecutive months of lower inflation.\n\nSome signs suggest that inflation will continue to cool in the coming months. Americans, particularly lower-income households, are pulling back on their spending.

The committee also signaled that it believes the long-run interest rate is higher than previously indicated.\n\nNew forecasts released after this week's two-day meeting indicated slight optimism that inflation remains on track to head back to the Fed's 2% goal, allowing for some policy loosening later this year.\n\n\"Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated,\" the post-meeting statement said, echoing language from the last statement. In the only substantive change, the new statement followed with, \"In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.\"\n\nThe previous language said there had been \"a lack of further progress\" on inflation.\n\nTraders seemed encouraged by these comments, with the S&P 500 jumping to a record Wednesday after the statement was issued.\n\nThe committee, in its closely watched \"dot plot\" of individual participants' rate expectations, did indicate a more aggressive cutting path in 2025, with four reductions totaling a full percentage point anticipated, up from three.\n\nFor the period through 2025, the committee now sees five total cuts equaling 1.25 percentage points, down from six in March. If the projections hold, it would leave the federal funds rate benchmark at 4.1% by the end of next year.\n\nAnother significant development occurred with the projection for the long-run rate of interest, essentially a level that neither boosts nor restricts growth. That moved up to 2.8% from 2.6%, a nod that the higher-for-longer narrative is gaining traction among Fed officials.\n\nIn a further indication of a hawkish bent from central bankers, the dot plot showed four officials in favor of no cuts this year, up from two previously.\n\nElsewhere in the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections, participants raised their 2024 outlook on inflation to 2.6%, or 2.8% when excluding food and energy. Both inflation projections were 0.2 percentage point higher than in March.\n\nThe Fed's preferred inflation gauge is the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures price index, which showed respective readings of 2.7% and 2.8% for April. The Fed focuses more on core inflation as a better long-term indicator. The SEP indicates inflation returning to the 2% target, but not until 2026.\n\nThe decision and informal forecasts from the 19 meeting participants come during a volatile year for markets and investors' hopes that the Fed would start easing after it raised benchmark rates to their highest level in some 23 years.\n\nThe federal funds rate, which sets overnight borrowing costs for banks but feeds into many consumer debt products, is targeted in a range between 5.25%-5.50%, the result of 11 rate increases between March 2022 and July 2023.\n\nEarlier in the day, as Fed officials were preparing their economic and rate outlooks, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the consumer price index for May. The report showed that inflation was flat on the month while the annual rate edged lower from the rate in April to 3.3%.\n\nThat's still well above the Fed's 2% target but also considerably below the peak of just over 9% seen nearly two years ago. Core readings excluding food and energy prices were at 0.2% from the prior month and 3.4% from the year-ago period.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, economic data softened from where it had been for most of the previous year, with GDP rising at just a 1.3% annualized pace. April and May have been a mixed bag for data, but the Atlanta Fed is tracking GDP growth at 3.1%, a solid pace especially in light of persistent recession worries that have dogged the economy for the past two years.\n\nInflation data, though, has been equally resilient and has posed problems for central bankers.\n\nThe year began with markets expecting a vigorous pace of rate cuts, only to be thwarted by sticky inflation and statements from Fed officials that they are unconvinced that inflation is heading back convincingly to target.\n\n\"This is a nothing-burger Fed meeting. They know conditions are improving, but don't need to rush with rate cuts,\" said David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation. \"The strong economy is letting Jerome Powell wring inflation out of the system without hurting jobs.

That projection came into question following a string of sticky inflation readings during the first quarter and cautious commentary from Fed officials.\n\nThe last reading from that index showed the year-over-year change holding at 2.8% in April from March, a confirmation that inflation had stopped accelerating after a sticky first quarter.\n\nMore evidence of a moderation on the inflation front came earlier Wednesday when a new reading from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.3% over the prior year in May -- a deceleration from April's 3.4% annual gain in prices.\n\nThe year-over-year change in \"core\" CPI -- which excludes volatile food and energy prices the Fed can't control -- was 3.4% compared with 3.6% in April and 3.8% in March.\n\nRead more: What the Fed rate decision means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\n\nFed Chair Jay Powell has made clear that, before cutting rates, the Fed will need more than a quarter's worth of data to make a judgment on whether inflation is steadily falling toward the central bank's goal of 2%.\n\nThe odds of a first cut in September rose following the CPI report Wednesday morning.\n\nThe September meeting is viewed by many as an optimistic case for a first cut. For that to happen, two more inflation reports in the coming months would likely need to show improvement for the central bank to pull the trigger.\n\nOn Wednesday Fed officials also retained their unemployment outlook at 4% and retained their GDP outlook of 2.1% for the year, as the outlook as growth in first quarter slowed on weaker consumer spending.\n\nThey also raised their outlook for the neutral rate - the rate that neither boosts or slows growth - to 2.8% from 2.6% previously.\n\nThe decision was unanimous.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_schonberger@aol.com", "name": "Jennifer Schonberger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Powell_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jay Powell (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_of_deposit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Certificate of deposit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Officiating", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sjMj0gLLk8PB2X3iCxqkIg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_yahoo_finance_433/468d35331cd491c637c746144f5c6151", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The trend, if it holds, could move the Federal Reserve closer to cutting its benchmark interest rate from its 23-year peak.\n\nConsumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs -- the closely watched \"core\" index -- rose 0.2 per cent from April to May, the government said Wednesday. That was down from 0.3 per cent the previous month and was the smallest increase since October. Measured from a year earlier, core prices rose 3.4 per cent, below last month's 3.6 per cent increase.\n\nFed officials are scrutinizing each month's inflation data to assess their progress in their fight against rising prices. Even as overall inflation moderates, such necessities as groceries, rent and health care are much pricier than they were three years ago -- a continuing source of public discontent and a political threat to President Joe Biden's re-election bid. Most other measures suggest that the economy is healthy: Unemployment remains low, hiring is robust and consumers are traveling, eating out and spending on entertainment.\n\nOverall inflation also slowed last month, with consumer prices unchanged from April to May, in part because of sharp falls in the cost of gasoline, air fares and new cars. Measured from a year earlier, consumer prices rose 3.3 per cent, less than the 3.6 per cent increase a month earlier.\n\nThe cost of auto insurance, which has soared in recent months, actually dipped from April to May, though it's still up more than 20 per cent from a year earlier. Grocery prices were unchanged last month, after declining slightly in April. They're now up just one per cent on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe Fed has kept its key rate unchanged for nearly a year after having rapidly raised it in 2022 and 2023 to fight the worst bout of inflation in four decades. Those higher rates have led, in turn, to more expensive mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other forms of consumer and business borrowing. Though inflation is now far below its peak of 9.1 per cent in mid-2022, it remains above the Fed's target level.\n\nPersistently elevated inflation has posed a vexing challenge for the Fed, which raises interest rates -- or keeps them high -- to try to slow borrowing and spending, cool the economy and ease the pace of price increases.\n\nThe longer the Fed keeps borrowing costs high, the more it risks weakening the economy too much and causing a recession. Yet if it cuts rates too soon, it risks reigniting inflation. Most of the policymakers have said they think their rate policies are slowing growth and should curb inflation over time.\n\nInflation had fallen steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could pull off a \"soft landing,\" whereby it manages to conquer inflation through higher interest rates without causing a recession. Such an outcome is difficult and rare.\n\nBut inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and possibly imperiling a soft landing.\n\nIn early May, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its target before it would reduce its benchmark rate. Several Fed officials have said in recent weeks that they needed to see several consecutive months of lower inflation.\n\nSome signs suggest that inflation will continue to cool in the coming months. Americans, particularly lower-income households, are pulling back on their spending. In response, several major retail and restaurant chains, including Walmart, Target, Walgreen's, McDonald's and Burger King, have responded by announcing price cuts or deals.", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger_King", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burger King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walmart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Target Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Quantity_Cooking", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Quantity Cooking", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/us-inflation.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

And it's expected to reiterate its view that inflation remains too high for, and presents too much of a growth risk to, the world's biggest economy.\n\nThat position, expected to be sketched out in detail through fresh growth and inflation projections from Fed officials on Wednesday, is likely to find further support from inflation data and market expectations even before Chairman Jerome Powell speaks to the media at 2:30 pm Eastern Time.\n\nThe Commerce Department will publish its first estimate of May consumer price inflation prior to the market open on Wednesday, and some economists suggest it could indicate moderating core and headline pressures that are likely to extend into the summer months.\n\n\"We look for a relatively firm increase in core CPI inflation that keeps year-ago inflation unchanged,\" JP Morgan analysts led by Michael Feroli wrote earlier this week.\n\n\"While we continue to expect further cooling in inflation this year -- and notably the Fed is focused on PCE inflation, which is running below CPI -- the current pace may leave various participants still concerned about lack of further progress.\"\n\nEasing headline figure; sticky core\n\nWall Street expects to see the headline reading hold at an annual rate of 3.4%, but ease notably to 0.1% when compared with April levels.\n\nSo-called core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is likely to ease to 3.5% on the year and hold at 0.3% on the month.\n\nThose levels are still a long way from the Fed's 2% target, and although Powell and his colleagues have said they could start cutting rates prior to reaching that threshold, they would still prefer to see \"several months\" of data that confirm a slowing inflation trend.\n\nRelated: Surprise jobs report pummels Fed rate-cut bets\n\nThat could be difficult in an economy that added 272,000 new jobs last month, a bigger-than-expected tally that included robust wage gains of 0.4%, and a current-quarter estimate from the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tool that suggests growth rate of 3.1%.\n\nSmall-business hiring plans, meanwhile, jumped to the highest level of the year last month, according to the National Federation of Independent Business's benchmark survey. Its broader optimism index recorded its second-consecutive monthly gain.\n\nStrong services sector\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management's benchmark index for activity in the services sector, the biggest component of U.S. growth, also impressed in May, rising to a nine-month high of 53.8 points as inflation pressure eased.\n\nThat could give the Fed deeper confidence that its long run of rate hikes, is having the desired, if prolonged, impact on inflation while allowing the economy to continue to grow.\n\n\"Last Friday's jobs report showed a domestic labor market that continues to follow the soft-landing blueprint by the book so far,\" said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede.\n\n\"Once investors gain firmer confidence in a return to price stability, markets may begin to adjust interest rates lower to account for an incrementally less restrictive Fed,\" he added.\n\nRelated: The Fed doesn't want to talk about stagflation. It might not have a choice.\n\nPowell would, of course, welcome such a soft-landing scenario into the second half, particularly if it means the Fed can avoid the political maelstrom of the autumn presidential race and pass on any rate decision during their September and November meetings.\n\n\"The Fed views monetary policy as restrictive and will keep rates higher for longer at these levels until they have confidence that inflation can sustainably get back to their target,\" said John Madziyire, head of U.S. Treasurys and TIPS and senior portfolio manager at Vanguard.\n\n\"The market is currently pricing in the first cut in December, but we are not forecasting any in 2024,\" he added.\n\nCME Group's FedWatch pegs the odds of a September cut at just 48%, with the chance of a follow-on move in December trading at similar levels.\n\nCentral bank wiggle room\n\nThat said, recent rate cuts from both the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank, as well as likely easing this week from the Bank of England, could provide cover for the Fed to deliver one rate reduction.\n\nThat would be an effort to ensure that consumers don't bear the brunt of its inflation-fighting policies while Wall Street celebrates record-high stock prices.\n\n\"We might need to wait until Fed governors get an earful over Thanksgiving dinner before we see rates cut,\" said Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager at Sit Investment Associates. \"People will be pretty sick of 22% credit card rates and 7.5% mortgage rates by then, given the loss of any kind of savings safety net.\"\n\n\"The Fed has a dentist's mentality, believing that pain now will save you suffering down the road,\" he added. \"They are oblivious to how high interest rates are driving up costs for businesses that are being passed onto the consumer.\"\n\nRelated: Goldman Sachs forecasts what's next for the Fed's rate outlook\n\nConsumers are indeed pushing back on relentless price hikes from major brands such as McDonald's (MCD) , Starbucks (SBUX) and Kraft Heinz (KHC) , with some evidence that they're also running-down their pandemic-era savings.\n\n\"The top 20% are in great shape with their high incomes meaning inflation is more of an irritation rather than a severe constraint,\" said ING's chief international economist, James Knightley.\n\n\"It is a very different situation for those lower-income households where high inflation has been a much greater burden and financial strains are emerging with credit-card and auto-loan delinquencies rising sharply.\"\n\nThat said, they're also expecting softer inflation pressures over the coming year.\n\nThe New York Fed's monthly survey of year-ahead inflation expectations eased to 3.2% last month, while the three-year projection held at 2.8%, a rate similar to that seen prior to the 2020 pandemic.\n\nMore Economic Analysis:\n\nSurprise jobs report pummels Fed rate-cut betsJobs report to highlight shift from hot inflation to cooling labor marketFed doesn't want to talk about stagflation.

Their projections for inflation will also be an important clue for the timing of the first rate cut.\n\nInflation's slowdown stalled in the first three months of the year, crushing Wall Street's hope that the Fed could cut rates aggressively in 2024, but then economic data showed that inflation moderated again in April. Fed policymakers need to be assured that inflation has cooled enough and is expected to moderate further before cutting rates. The Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index for May at 8:30 am ET Wednesday.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks during his post-meeting news conference could also provide some hints on what to expect from the central bank in upcoming policy meetings. The Fed chief will likely double down on officials' current strategy of waiting patiently for more data proving that inflation is headed toward their 2% target before they begin to lower borrowing costs. A solid job market, as reflected in the latest employment figures, is helping the Fed sit tight.\n\nThe Fed holding off on cutting rates is in marked contrast with other central banks that have already begun to lower borrowing costs, such as the European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada.\n\nClues on the first rate cut\n\nWall Street's best bet for the first rate cut is currently September, according to futures.\n\nBut before that meeting, Powell is expected to make his annual speech at the Jackson Hole annual economic symposium in August, which usually contains key hints for policy moves later in the year. There appears to be broad agreement among Fed officials that interest rates are high enough and that central bankers can hold rates steady for now, thanks to the economy's resilience.\n\n\"I don't feel any urgency or need that we have to make a decision now,\" New York Fed President John Williams said a few weeks ago at an event hosted by the Economic Club of New York when asked if he'd support a rate cut.\n\n\"The policy that we put in place is working,\" Williams added. \"But the view on what is the appropriate path for policy is adjusting with the change in the outlook.\"\n\nStill, Powell and other officials have reiterated in recent speeches that the Fed will likely cut interest rates sometime this year and the Fed chief could re-emphasize that view in his post-meeting press conference. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said at a London event in late May that \"it certainly won't be more than two cuts.\"\n\nIt'll be a difficult and consequential decision whenever the Fed starts cutting, because there are risks if the Fed reduces rates too soon -- and risks if it cuts too late. The former could result in inflation heating back up and the latter could result in the economy slipping into a recession because rates were too high for too long.\n\nA slower economy ahead but no alarm bells\n\nThe US economy remains healthy by several key measures, but data shows that many Americans are under pressure. Interest rates are at their highest level in nearly a quarter century, inflation remains elevated, borrowers continue to rack up debt and pandemic savings are dwindling.\n\nConsumers have also slowed their spending in recent months and retailers say that shoppers have changed their purchasing behavior.\n\nAdditionally, Fed officials' projections for unemployment this year will likely be revised higher, since the jobless rate is currently at 4%, already matching officials' current median projection for 2024.\n\nA weaker-than-expected jobs total for April raised fears that the economy is swiftly deteriorating, but data stretching over several months suggests that month was likely just a one-off and not reflective of a new trend.\n\n\"We're seeing a cooling off from nominal levels that are still very high, so we're basically just normalizing back towards more sustainable levels of growth,\" Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers, told CNN.\n\nStill, economists are generally expecting both the broader economy and the job market to slow further in the second half of the year. A cooling economy would bode well for lower interest rates.\n\nWill inflation continue to slow?\n\nThe Fed clearly isn't content with where inflation is right now. And it remains to be seen whether officials will be satisfied anytime soon.\n\nThe Fed's official target is 2%, so the central bank will keep at it until inflation has reached that threshold and remains there for several months.\n\nThe Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index -- rose 2.7% in April from a year earlier, down substantially from 4.4% in April 2023.

The trend, if it holds, could move the Federal Reserve closer to cutting its benchmark interest rate from its 23-year peak.\n\nConsumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs - the closely watched \"core\" index - rose 0.2% from April to May, the government said Wednesday. That was down from 0.3% the previous month and was the smallest increase since October. Measured from a year earlier, core prices climbed 3.4%, below last month's 3.6% rise. That was the mildest such increase in three years.\n\nFed officials are scrutinizing each month's inflation data to assess their progress in their fight against rising prices. Even as overall inflation moderates, such necessities as groceries, rent and health care are much pricier than they were three years ago - a continuing source of public discontent and a political threat to President Biden's re-election bid. Most other measures suggest that the economy is healthy: Unemployment remains low, hiring is robust and consumers are traveling, eating out and spending on entertainment.\n\nWednesday's report suggested that consumers are beginning to get some relief from the price spikes of the past three years. Grocery costs were unchanged, on average, from April to May, after actually falling 0.2% the previous month. Food prices have risen just 1% over the past 12 months, though they're still up about 20% from three years ago.\n\nAverage gas prices tumbled 3.6% nationally just from April to May, though they're 2.2% higher than they were a year earlier. Those declines have continued, with gas averaging $3.45 a gallon Wednesday, down 17 cents from a month ago. Americans didn't drive as much over the Memorial Day weekend as they have in previous years, reducing demand, and oil prices have fallen.\n\nOverall inflation also slowed last month, with consumer prices unchanged from April to May. Measured from a year earlier, prices rose 3.3%, less than the 3.6% increase a month earlier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's certainly welcome news,\" said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at PGIM Fixed Income. \"It drives home that the inflation challenge in the United States is not as challenging as monetary policy makers believe.\"\n\nAirfares, furniture and clothing also dropped in price last month, helping keep inflation in check. And the cost of auto insurance, which has soared in recent months, actually dipped from April to May, though it's still up more than 20% from a year earlier.\n\nThe Fed has kept its key rate unchanged for nearly a year after having rapidly raised it in 2022 and 2023 to fight the worst bout of inflation in four decades. Those higher rates have led, in turn, to more expensive mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other forms of consumer and business borrowing. Though inflation is now far below its peak of 9.1% in mid-2022, it remains above the Fed's target level.\n\nPersistently elevated inflation has posed a vexing challenge for the Fed, which raises interest rates - or keeps them high - to try to slow borrowing and spending, cool the economy and ease the pace of price increases.\n\nThe longer the Fed keeps borrowing costs high, the more it risks weakening the economy too much and causing a recession. Yet if it cuts rates too soon, it risks reigniting inflation. Most of the policymakers have said they think their rate policies are slowing growth and should curb inflation over time.\n\nInflation had fallen steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could pull off a \"soft landing,\" whereby it manages to conquer inflation through higher interest rates without causing a recession. Such an outcome is difficult and rare.\n\nBut inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and possibly imperiling a soft landing.\n\nIn early May, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its target before it would reduce its benchmark rate. Several Fed officials have said in recent weeks that they needed to see several consecutive months of lower inflation.\n\nSome signs suggest that inflation will continue to cool in the coming months. Americans, particularly lower-income households, are pulling back on their spending. In response, several major retail and restaurant chains, including Walmart, Target, Walgreen's, McDonald's and Burger King, have responded by announcing price cuts or deals.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Their projections for inflation will also be an important clue for the timing of the first rate cut.\n\nThe latest Consumer Price Index showed that prices rose 3.3% on an annualized basis in May but inflation's slowdown stalled in the first three months of the year, crushing Wall Street's hope that the Fed could cut rates aggressively.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks during his post-meeting news conference could also provide some hints on what to expect from the central bank in upcoming policy meetings. The Fed chief will likely double down on officials' current strategy of waiting patiently for more data proving that inflation is headed toward their 2% target before they begin to lower borrowing costs. A solid job market, as reflected in the latest employment figures, is helping the Fed sit tight.\n\nThe Fed holding off on cutting rates is in marked contrast with other central banks that have already begun to lower borrowing costs, such as the European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada.\n\nClues on the first rate cut\n\nWall Street's best bet for the first rate cut is currently September, according to futures.\n\nBut before that meeting, Powell is expected to make his annual speech at the Jackson Hole annual economic symposium in August, which usually contains key hints for policy moves later in the year. There appears to be broad agreement among Fed officials that interest rates are high enough and that central bankers can hold rates steady for now, thanks to the economy's resilience.\n\n\"I don't feel any urgency or need that we have to make a decision now,\" New York Fed President John Williams said a few weeks ago at an event hosted by the Economic Club of New York when asked if he'd support a rate cut.\n\n\"The policy that we put in place is working,\" Williams added. \"But the view on what is the appropriate path for policy is adjusting with the change in the outlook.\"\n\nStill, Powell and other officials have reiterated in recent speeches that the Fed will likely cut interest rates sometime this year and the Fed chief could re-emphasize that view in his post-meeting press conference. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said at a London event in late May that \"it certainly won't be more than two cuts.\"\n\nIt'll be a difficult and consequential decision whenever the Fed starts cutting, because there are risks if the Fed reduces rates too soon -- and risks if it cuts too late. The former could result in inflation heating back up and the latter could result in the economy slipping into a recession because rates were too high for too long.\n\nA slower economy ahead but no alarm bells\n\nThe US economy remains healthy by several key measures, but data shows that many Americans are under pressure. Interest rates are at their highest level in nearly a quarter century, inflation remains elevated, borrowers continue to rack up debt and pandemic savings are dwindling.\n\nConsumers have also slowed their spending in recent months and retailers say that shoppers have changed their purchasing behavior.\n\nAdditionally, Fed officials' projections for unemployment this year will likely be revised higher, since the jobless rate is currently at 4%, already matching officials' current median projection for 2024.\n\nA weaker-than-expected jobs total for April raised fears that the economy is swiftly deteriorating, but data stretching over several months suggests that month was likely just a one-off and not reflective of a new trend.\n\n\"We're seeing a cooling off from nominal levels that are still very high, so we're basically just normalizing back towards more sustainable levels of growth,\" Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers, told CNN.\n\nStill, economists are generally expecting both the broader economy and the job market to slow further in the second half of the year. A cooling economy would bode well for lower interest rates.\n\nWill inflation continue to slow?\n\nThe Fed clearly isn't content with where inflation is right now. And it remains to be seen whether officials will be satisfied anytime soon.\n\nThe Fed's official target is 2%, so the central bank will keep at it until inflation has reached that threshold and remains there for several months.\n\nThe Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index -- rose 2.7% in April from a year earlier, down substantially from 4.4% in April 2023. But on an annualized basis, consumer prices were up 2.9% over the six months through April, an acceleration from 2.4% in the prior six months.\n\nPowell has said that \"we're not satisfied with 3% inflation.\"\n\nOne particularly stubborn category has kept pressure on inflation for months: shelter. It makes up a large portion of the CPI and, to a lesser extent, PCE. Fed policymakers and economists have been waiting for declining rents to show up in the data. Wednesday's CPI data showed that shelter inflation more than offset the decline in gasoline, rising 0.4% for the fourth month in a row, underscoring the pressure Americans are feeling from housing-related expenses.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Sign up for NBC Boston's newsletters.\n\nThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept its key interest rate unchanged and signaled that just one cut is expected before the end of the year.\n\nWith markets hoping for a more accommodative central bank, Federal Open Market Committee policymakers following their two-day meeting took two rate reductions off the table from the three indicated in March. The committee also signaled that it believes the long-run interest rate is higher than previously indicated.\n\nNew forecasts released after this week's two-day meeting indicated slight optimism that inflation remains on track to head back to the Fed's 2% goal, allowing for some policy loosening later this year.\n\n\"Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated,\" the post-meeting statement said, echoing language from the last statement. In the only substantive change, the new statement followed with, \"In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.\"\n\nThe previous language said there had been \"a lack of further progress\" on inflation.\n\nTraders seemed encouraged by these comments, with the S&P 500 jumping to a record Wednesday after the statement was issued.\n\nThe committee, in its closely watched \"dot plot\" of individual participants' rate expectations, did indicate a more aggressive cutting path in 2025, with four reductions totaling a full percentage point anticipated, up from three.\n\nFor the period through 2025, the committee now sees five total cuts equaling 1.25 percentage points, down from six in March. If the projections hold, it would leave the federal funds rate benchmark at 4.1% by the end of next year.\n\nAnother significant development occurred with the projection for the long-run rate of interest, essentially a level that neither boosts nor restricts growth. That moved up to 2.8% from 2.6%, a nod that the higher-for-longer narrative is gaining traction among Fed officials.\n\nIn a further indication of a hawkish bent from central bankers, the dot plot showed four officials in favor of no cuts this year, up from two previously.\n\nElsewhere in the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections, participants raised their 2024 outlook on inflation to 2.6%, or 2.8% when excluding food and energy. Both inflation projections were 0.2 percentage point higher than in March.\n\nThe Fed's preferred inflation gauge is the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures price index, which showed respective readings of 2.7% and 2.8% for April. The Fed focuses more on core inflation as a better long-term indicator. The SEP indicates inflation returning to the 2% target, but not until 2026.\n\nThe decision and informal forecasts from the 19 meeting participants come during a volatile year for markets and investors' hopes that the Fed would start easing after it raised benchmark rates to their highest level in some 23 years.\n\nThe federal funds rate, which sets overnight borrowing costs for banks but feeds into many consumer debt products, is targeted in a range between 5.25%-5.50%, the result of 11 rate increases between March 2022 and July 2023.\n\nEarlier in the day, as Fed officials were preparing their economic and rate outlooks, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the consumer price index for May. The report showed that inflation was flat on the month while the annual rate edged lower from the rate in April to 3.3%.\n\nThat's still well above the Fed's 2% target but also considerably below the peak of just over 9% seen nearly two years ago. Core readings excluding food and energy prices were at 0.2% from the prior month and 3.4% from the year-ago period.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, economic data softened from where it had been for most of the previous year, with GDP rising at just a 1.3% annualized pace. April and May have been a mixed bag for data, but the Atlanta Fed is tracking GDP growth at 3.1%, a solid pace especially in light of persistent recession worries that have dogged the economy for the past two years.\n\nInflation data, though, has been equally resilient and has posed problems for central bankers.\n\nThe year began with markets expecting a vigorous pace of rate cuts, only to be thwarted by sticky inflation and statements from Fed officials that they are unconvinced that inflation is heading back convincingly to target.\n\n\"This is a nothing-burger Fed meeting. They know conditions are improving, but don't need to rush with rate cuts,\" said David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation. \"The strong economy is letting Jerome Powell wring inflation out of the system without hurting jobs.

This will likely please officials at the Federal Reserve, who are set to announce an interest rate decision Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAlthough Fed officials are widely expected to keep the key fed funds rate at its current 23-year high, the better-than-expected report could accelerate the timetable for rate cuts later this year, and ease concerns that inflation is flaring up again after a string of worse-than-expected consumer price reports in the first quarter.\n\nThe Fed's campaign of anti-inflation interest rate hikes have pushed up borrowing costs on mortgages, credit cards, and other debt in an effort to stifle inflation by discouraging borrowing and spending. If lower inflation brings on lower interest rates sooner, it could relieve some pressure on people who have struggled to afford to buy a house or pay down credit card debt for example.\n\nThe May report \"keeps alive the prospect of the Fed starting to cut rates in September,\" Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at insurance company Nationwide wrote in a commentary.\n\nBefore the report, traders were pricing in a 54.4% in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, which forecasts rate movements based on fed funds futures trading data. Later in the morning, that number jumped to 72.7%.\n\nAs expectations rise in light of the inflation report, more scrutiny will be put on the Federal Reserve's policy projections that will be released this afternoon.\n\n\"The materials and post-meeting press conference from the FOMC's meeting later today will shed more light on how the Committee sees inflation evolving alongside its employment mandate,\" wrote Wells Fargo economists Sarah House and Michael Pugliese.\n\nWhen setting interest rates, Fed officials pay close attention to \"core\" inflation, which excludes prices for food and energy that tend to rise and fall for reasons that have nothing to do with broader inflation trends. Core inflation was better than expected, rising 0.2% over the month, less than the 0.3% increase that forecasters expected, making for a 3.4% increase over the year, again undershooting the consensus forecast for a 3.5% increase.\n\nHowever, Wednesday's favorable report likely doesn't mean the fight against inflation is over. Fed officials have repeatedly said they are looking to economic data for signs that inflation is sustainably falling toward its 2% annual goal before cutting interest rates.\n\n\"The Fed will likely need to see another couple of months of inflation moderation to give the all-clear to cut interest rates in September,\" wrote BMO's Chief U.S. Economist Scott Anderson. \"Restrictive monetary policy has more work to do, and the Fed will remain patient and watchful. However, today's far softer CPI report will go a long way in making the case that it can soon safely ease off the monetary brake pedal without risking another inflation episode.\"", "source": {"uri": "investopedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investopedia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/JDFSHjN45lzVF5wXtx4M1lRi2JQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-2097696981-6df3dc73fbe341df83b54ea4819d3a68.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Prices were flat month over month for the first time in two years. A narrower measure of inflation that strips out volatile categories like food and energy also came in slower than it has for months. The overall report beat analysts' expectations and suggested that the Federal Reserve's inflation fight may be back on track after a bumpy start of the year. Major stock indexes flashed green at Wednesday's open.\n\nThe Fed has been putting the economy under pressure through higher interest rates since March 2022, trying to control prices that grew at the fastest pace in four decades. And the latest snapshot will probably be welcomed by central bankers as they wrap up their two-day policy meeting later Wednesday. By the afternoon, they're all but guaranteed to leave interest rates unchanged, holding them between 5.25 and 5.5 percent - where they've sat since July, at the highest level since 2001.\n\nThat lack of action is widely expected. What Wall Street, Washington and business and households around the country will watch eagerly is where Fed policymakers think the economy is headed. Officials are set to release a fresh set of economic projections at 2 p.m. Eastern, laying out their expectations for inflation, the unemployment rate, overall growth and interest rates.\n\nWhen the year started, the central bank was looking at three rate cuts in 2024. But because inflation came in hotter than expected from January to March, analysts now bet officials will pencil in only one or two cuts this year. And while the Fed doesn't react to individual reports, it has been itching for this kind of encouraging data to feel confident that inflation won't reignite if officials start to cut.\n\n\"It will be interesting to see what signal they take from the data,\" said Bill English, former head of the Fed's Division of Monetary Affairs who is now at Yale School of Management. \"'Why' are they seeing less easing will be as important as 'how much' less?\"\n\n[Retailers are finally cutting prices. Will it last?]\n\n[Surprising U.S. economy is powering better global outlook, World Bank says]\n\nHousing costs continue to be a main driver of overall inflation, as has been the case for more than a year. A key rent gauge carried on a streak of rising 0.4 percent over the previous month. Overall shelter costs were up 5.4 percent over the previous year. Many real-time measures of rent costs show rents easing considerably, or even falling. But those shifts have taken way longer than expected to show up in official data, frustrating Fed officials and economists who fear the rental figures are keeping overall inflation artificially high.\n\nMedical care costs also rose slightly more in May than in April. Costs for prescription drugs rose 2.1 percent, and hospital services increased 0.5 percent.\n\nYet energy costs index fell 2 percent over the month, led by a 3.6 percent drop in the gas index. Airfare also fell 3.6 percent, following a 0.8-percent decrease in April.\n\nMore clarity on how the Fed read the report will come at 2:30 p.m., when Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell appears at a news conference. Questions will probably hit on the timing for rate cuts, what it will take to bring borrowing costs down and whether he is confident inflation will keep moving toward the Fed's target. (The Fed aims for a 2 percent rise in inflation each year, though it uses a different gauge than the one released Wednesday.)\n\nKey to leaders' assessment is whether they think inflation is steadily falling, or whether the unwanted surprises from the beginning of the year signal something more lasting and worrisome. Some economists speculate that seasonal glitches that often interfere with January data - for example, the resetting of annual insurance costs - seeped into the entire first quarter and interfered with the central bank's read on inflation.\n\nBut others wonder whether price increases are simply sticking. Last month, Fed governor Christopher Waller said progress \"may be a lot slower than we saw at the end of last year,\" when inflation came down markedly.\n\n\"Whatever the factors were in the first three months, they haven't completely disappeared,\" Waller said at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"There might be something much more fundamental going on than seasonal. I don't know exactly what that would be. We're still all trying to figure out what it is.\"\n\nStill, the Fed has made major progress since inflation peaked two years ago at 9.1 percent, and the economy is roaring. Employers added a whopping 272,000 jobs in May. Wages continue to outpace inflation, and there's no recession in sight. Yet the sting of high prices has still left businesses, workers and families with the sense that the economy isn't working for them.\n\nThat disconnect is proving to be a major issue for President Biden's reelection campaign, as he tries to tout the economic turnaround since the depths of the pandemic. In a statement Wednesday, Biden said the report showed \"welcome progress\" but noted \"many families are feeling squeezed by the cost of living.\" He touted his administration's moves to address costs for housing, prescription drugs and groceries.\n\nFormer president Donald Trump, meanwhile, has seized on high inflation and subsequent interest rate hikes to argue Americans are suffering under the weight of steep mortgage rates and sticker shock for the basics, even though economists estimate that many of his proposals would send inflation even higher.\n\nFor its part, the Fed tries hard to steer clear of politics, and it stakes much of its reputation on an independence from the rest of Washington. But if officials still need a few more months to feel comfortable cutting rates, they could end up making an initial move right before the election. This week, top Democrats on the Senate and House budget committees called for the Fed to lower rates, raising concerns that holding out could jeopardize the strong job market.\n\nOfficials insist they will make decisions only as the data unfold.\n\n\"It's hard enough to get the economics right here,\" Powell said last month. \"These are difficult things, and if, if we were to take on a whole, another, set of factors and use that as a new filter, it would reduce the likelihood we'd actually get the economics right.\"", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage

And it's expected to reiterate its view that inflation remains too high for, and presents too much of a growth risk to, the world's biggest economy.\n\nThat position, expected to be sketched out in detail through fresh growth and inflation projections from Fed officials on Wednesday, is likely to find further support from inflation data and market expectations even before Chairman Jerome Powell speaks to the media at 2:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time.\n\nThe Commerce Department will publish its first estimate of May consumer price inflation prior to the market open on Wednesday. Some economists suggest it could indicate moderating core and headline pressures that are likely to extend into the summer months.\n\n\"We look for a relatively firm increase in core CPI inflation that keeps year-ago inflation unchanged,\" JP Morgan analysts led by Michael Feroli wrote earlier this week.\n\n\"While we continue to expect further cooling in inflation this year -- and notably the Fed is focused on PCE inflation, which is running below CPI -- the current pace may leave various participants still concerned about lack of further progress.\"\n\nWall Street expects to see the headline reading hold at an annual rate of 3.4%, but ease notably to 0.1% when compared with April levels.\n\nSo-called core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is likely to ease to 3.5% on the year and hold at 0.3% on the month.\n\nThose levels are still a long way from the Fed's 2% target, and although Powell and his colleagues have said they could start cutting rates prior to reaching that threshold, they would still prefer to see \"several months\" of data that confirm a slowing inflation trend.\n\nRelated: Surprise jobs report pummels Fed rate-cut bets\n\nThat could be difficult in an economy that added 272,000 new jobs last month, a bigger-than-expected tally that included robust wage gains of 0.4%, and a current-quarter estimate from the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tool that suggests growth rate of 3.1%.\n\nSmall-business hiring plans, meanwhile, jumped to the highest level of the year last month, according to the National Federation of Independent Business's benchmark survey. Its broader optimism index recorded its second-consecutive monthly gain.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management's benchmark index for activity in the services sector, the biggest component of U.S. growth, also impressed in May, rising to a nine-month high of 53.8 points as inflation pressure eased.\n\nThat could give the Fed deeper confidence that its long run of rate hikes, is having the desired, if prolonged, impact on inflation while allowing the economy to continue to grow.\n\n\"Last Friday's jobs report showed a domestic labor market that continues to follow the soft-landing blueprint by the book so far,\" said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede.\n\n\"Once investors gain firmer confidence in a return to price stability, markets may begin to adjust interest rates lower to account for an incrementally less restrictive Fed,\" he added.\n\nRelated: The Fed doesn't want to talk about stagflation. It might not have a choice.\n\nPowell would, of course, welcome such a soft-landing scenario into the second half, particularly if it means the Fed can avoid the political maelstrom of the autumn presidential race and pass on any rate decision during their September and November meetings.\n\n\"The Fed views monetary policy as restrictive and will keep rates higher for longer at these levels until they have confidence that inflation can sustainably get back to their target,\" said John Madziyire, head of U.S. Treasurys and TIPS and senior portfolio manager at Vanguard.\n\n\"The market is currently pricing in the first cut in December, but we are not forecasting any in 2024,\" he added.\n\nCME Group's FedWatch pegs the odds of a September cut at just 48%, with the chance of a follow-on move in December trading at similar levels.\n\nThat said, recent rate cuts from both the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank, as well as likely easing this week from the Bank of England, could provide cover for the Fed to deliver one rate reduction.\n\nThat would be an effort to ensure that consumers don't bear the brunt of its inflation-fighting policies while Wall Street celebrates record-high stock prices.\n\n\"We might need to wait until Fed governors get an earful over Thanksgiving dinner before we see rates cut,\" said Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager at Sit Investment Associates. \"People will be pretty sick of 22% credit card rates and 7.5% mortgage rates by then, given the loss of any kind of savings safety net.\"\n\n\"The Fed has a dentist's mentality, believing that pain now will save you suffering down the road,\" he added. \"They are oblivious to how high interest rates are driving up costs for businesses that are being passed onto the consumer.\"\n\nRelated: Goldman Sachs forecasts what's next for the Fed's rate outlook\n\nConsumers are indeed pushing back on relentless price hikes from major brands such as McDonald's (MCD) , Starbucks (SBUX) and Kraft Heinz (KHC) , with some evidence that they're also running-down their pandemic-era savings.\n\n\"The top 20% are in great shape with their high incomes meaning inflation is more of an irritation rather than a severe constraint,\" said ING's chief international economist, James Knightley.\n\n\"It is a very different situation for those lower-income households where high inflation has been a much greater burden and financial strains are emerging with credit-card and auto-loan delinquencies rising sharply.\"\n\nThat said, they're also expecting softer inflation pressures over the coming year.\n\nThe New York Fed's monthly survey of year-ahead inflation expectations eased to 3.2% last month, while the three-year projection held at 2.8%, a rate similar to that seen prior to the 2020 pandemic.\n\nMore Economic Analysis:\n\n\"The economic tug-of-war is between a relatively strong consumer and higher than comfortable inflation,\" said Jeff Klingelhofer, co-head of investments at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, N.M.\n\n\"While indicators show signs the battle is coming to a conclusion, it's not clear which side will be victorious,\" he noted. \"I would like to hear Chair Powell reiterate that rates are in restrictive territory and emphasize patience.\"", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

They have held them steady since, hoping that higher borrowing costs will slow consumer and business demand enough to crush price increases.\n\nInflation slowed steadily in 2023, coming down enough that Fed officials entered 2024 expecting to cut interest rates three times this year. But then price increases proved surprisingly stubborn at the start of the year -- and policymakers had to push back their plans for rate cuts, afraid of lowering borrowing costs too early.\n\nNow that picture is in the process of changing again. Fresh consumer price index inflation data released Wednesday reaffirmed that the early 2024 inflation stickiness was a speed bump rather than a change in the trend: Price increases cooled notably in May. But it is getting too late in the year for the Fed to pull off the trio of rate cuts that they had expected as recently as March, the last time that policymakers released economic forecasts. Officials predicted in their fresh forecasts Wednesday that they will lower rates just once, to 5.1%, before the end of 2024.\n\nFed officials gave no clear hint as to when rate cuts will start. They meet four more times this year: in July, September, November and December.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell said during a news conference that officials are still looking for \"greater confidence\" that inflation is moving sustainably to 2% before cutting rates.\n\n\"The economic outlook is uncertain,\" Powell said. \"We remain highly attentive to inflation risks.\"\n\nPowell explained that moving policy \"too soon or too much\" could result in a reversal in progress on inflation, but that moving too late or too little could \"unduly\" weaken economic activity. He made it clear that the Fed's fresh forecasts are not a firm plan or a decision -- things could change.\n\nThe Fed's single rate cut prediction might come as something of a surprise to investors and economists, many of whom had expected the Fed to still aim for two reductions before the end of the year. But the big revision came as Fed policymakers took a broader turn toward greater caution. The Fed's forecasts showed that officials expect inflation to prove stickier than they had previously anticipated in 2024: Overall inflation could end the year at 2.6%, they predicted, up from 2.4% in their earlier estimate. Central bankers also forecast that the unemployment rate might tick up slightly more next year than they had previously anticipated.\n\nPolicymakers did adjust their statement to reflect that price increases have begun to cool again after stalling early in the year.\n\n\"In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the committee's 2% inflation objective,\" the Fed's statement said.\n\nPowell suggested that the Fed's inflation forecasts were \"conservative\" ones.\n\n\"We welcome today's reading and hope for more like that,\" Powell said.\n\nWhile the overall picture painted by the Fed's economic forecasts was a wary one, it did have its silver linings.\n\nPolicymakers predicted that growth would hold up even as rates remained higher this year. And Fed officials expected to lower interest rates more rapidly next year, suggesting that some of the rate cuts that they had initially planned to make in 2024 were simply getting pushed back. They now expected to make four rate cuts in 2025, up from three previously. Rates were expected to end 2026 at 3.1%, unchanged from the March estimate.\n\nBut the Fed did increase its forecast for where interest rates will settle in the longer run. The long-run interest rate is a rough estimate of the setting that will keep the economy operating at an even keel over time, so if rates are above it you would expect them to slow the economy, and if they are below it you would expect them to speed it up. Officials now see that longer run \"neutral\" setting at 2.8%, up from 2.6% previously, which suggests that Wednesday's policy-setting is tapping the brakes on growth a little bit less aggressively than was previously understood.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy_and_Forecasting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy and Forecasting", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Star-Advertiser-thumbnail-image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The committee also signaled that it believes the long-run interest rate is higher than previously indicated.\n\nNew forecasts released after this week's two-day meeting indicated only slight optimism that inflation remains on track to head back to the Fed's 2% goal, allowing for some policy loosening later this year.\n\n\"Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated,\" the post-meeting statement said, echoing language from the last statement. In the only substantive change, the new statement followed with, \"In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.\"\n\nThe previous language said there had been \"a lack of further progress\" on inflation.\n\nThe committee, in its closely watched \"dot plot\" of individual participants' rate expectations, did indicate a more aggressive cutting path in 2025, with four reductions totaling a full percentage point anticipated, up from three.\n\nFor the period through 2025, the committee now sees five total cuts equaling 1.25 percentage points, down from six in March.\n\nIf the projections hold, it would leave the federal funds rate benchmark at 4.1% by the end of next year, higher by 0.2 percentage point than the March outlook.\n\nAnother significant development occurred with the projection for the long-run rate of interest, essentially a level that neither boosts nor restricts growth. That moved up to 2.8% from 2.6%, a nod that the higher-for-longer narrative is gaining traction among Fed officials.\n\nIn a further indication of a hawkish bent from central bankers, the dot plot showed four officials in favor of no cuts this year, up from two previously.\n\nElsewhere in the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections, participants raised their 2024 outlook on inflation to 2.6%, or 2.8% when excluding food and energy. Both inflation projections were 0.2 percentage point higher than in March.\n\nThe Fed's preferred inflation gauge is the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures price index, which showed respective readings of 2.7% and 2.8% for April. The Fed focuses more on core inflation as a better long-term indicator. The SEP indicates inflation returning to the 2% target, but not until 2026.\n\nThe decision and informal forecasts from the 19 meeting participants come during a volatile year for markets and investors' hopes that the Fed would start easing after it raised benchmark rates to their highest level in some 23 years.\n\nThe federal funds rate, which sets overnight borrowing costs for banks but feeds into many consumer debt products, is targeted in a range between 5.25%-5.5%, the result of 11 rate increases between March 2022 and July 2023.\n\nEarlier in the day, as Fed officials were preparing their economic and rate outlooks, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the consumer price index for May. The report showed that inflation was flat on the month while the annual rate edged lower from the rate in April to 3.3%.\n\nThat's still well above the Fed's 2% target but also considerably below the peak of just over 9% seen nearly two years ago. Core readings excluding food and energy prices were at 0.2% and 3.4% respectively.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, economic data softened from where it had been for most of the previous year, with GDP rising at just a 1.3% annualized pace. April and May have been a mixed bag for data, but the Atlanta Fed is tracking GDP growth at 3.1%, a solid pace especially in light of persistent recession worries that have dogged the economy for the past two years.\n\nInflation data, though, has been equally resilient and has posed problems for central bankers.\n\nThe year began with markets expecting a vigorous pace of rate cuts, only to be thwarted by sticky inflation and statements from Fed officials that they are unconvinced that inflation is heading back convincingly to target.", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_cox@cnbc.com", "name": "Jeff Cox", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_consumption_expenditures_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal consumption expenditures price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107409037-17145892582024-05-01t184544z_1052945606_rc2uh7a3ktmz_rtrmadp_0_usa-economy-fed.jpeg?v=1714589292&w=1920&h=1080", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Their projections for inflation will also be an important clue for the timing of the first rate cut.\n\nInflation's slowdown stalled in the first three months of the year, crushing Wall Street's hope that the Fed could cut rates aggressively in 2024, but then economic data showed that inflation moderated again in April. Fed policymakers need to be assured that inflation has cooled enough and is expected to moderate further before cutting rates. The Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index for May at 8:30 am ET Wednesday.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks during his post-meeting news conference could also provide some hints on what to expect from the central bank in upcoming policy meetings. The Fed chief will likely double down on officials' current strategy of waiting patiently for more data proving that inflation is headed toward their 2% target before they begin to lower borrowing costs. A solid job market, as reflected in the latest employment figures, is helping the Fed sit tight.\n\nThe Fed holding off on cutting rates is in marked contrast with other central banks that have already begun to lower borrowing costs, such as the European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada.\n\nWall Street's best bet for the first rate cut is currently September, according to futures.\n\nBut before that meeting, Powell is expected to make his annual speech at the Jackson Hole annual economic symposium in August, which usually contains key hints for policy moves later in the year. There appears to be broad agreement among Fed officials that interest rates are high enough and that central bankers can hold rates steady for now, thanks to the economy's resilience.\n\n\"I don't feel any urgency or need that we have to make a decision now,\" New York Fed President John Williams said a few weeks ago at an event hosted by the Economic Club of New York when asked if he'd support a rate cut.\n\n\"The policy that we put in place is working,\" Williams added. \"But the view on what is the appropriate path for policy is adjusting with the change in the outlook.\"\n\nStill, Powell and other officials have reiterated in recent speeches that the Fed will likely cut interest rates sometime this year and the Fed chief could re-emphasize that view in his post-meeting press conference. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said at a London event in late May that \"it certainly won't be more than two cuts.\"\n\nIt'll be a difficult and consequential decision whenever the Fed starts cutting, because there are risks if the Fed reduces rates too soon -- and risks if it cuts too late. The former could result in inflation heating back up and the latter could result in the economy slipping into a recession because rates were too high for too long.\n\nThe US economy remains healthy by several key measures, but data shows that many Americans are under pressure. Interest rates are at their highest level in nearly a quarter century, inflation remains elevated, borrowers continue to rack up debt and pandemic savings are dwindling.\n\nConsumers have also slowed their spending in recent months and retailers say that shoppers have changed their purchasing behavior.\n\nAdditionally, Fed officials' projections for unemployment this year will likely be revised higher, since the jobless rate is currently at 4%, already matching officials' current median projection for 2024.\n\nA weaker-than-expected jobs total for April raised fears that the economy is swiftly deteriorating, but data stretching over several months suggests that month was likely just a one-off and not reflective of a new trend.\n\n\"We're seeing a cooling off from nominal levels that are still very high, so we're basically just normalizing back towards more sustainable levels of growth,\" Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers, told CNN.\n\nStill, economists are generally expecting both the broader economy and the job market to slow further in the second half of the year. A cooling economy would bode well for lower interest rates.\n\nThe Fed clearly isn't content with where inflation is right now. And it remains to be seen whether officials will be satisfied anytime soon.\n\nThe Fed's official target is 2%, so the central bank will keep at it until inflation has reached that threshold and remains there for several months.\n\nThe Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index -- rose 2.7% in April from a year earlier, down substantially from 4.4% in April 2023. But on an annualized basis, consumer prices were up 2.9% over the six months through April, an acceleration from 2.4% in the prior six months.\n\nPowell has said that \"we're not satisfied with 3% inflation.\"\n\nOne particularly stubborn category has kept pressure on inflation for months: shelter. It makes up a large portion of the CPI and, to a lesser extent, PCE. Fed policymakers and economists have been waiting for declining rents to show up in the data. Wednesday's inflation report should shed new light on that.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

The core measure that omits food and energy costs increased by 0.2%, lower than the expected 0.3% increase.\n\nFor the year, consumer inflation is running at a 3.3% rate, while the core is up 3.4%. Gasoline costs dropped by 3.6% in the month, but shelter prices increased by 0.4%.\n\n\"Wednesday's weaker-than-expected CPI will allow the Fed to start cutting interest rates as soon as September, since we have now seen multiple encouraging inflation readings, after the concerning spike in inflation earlier this year,\" said Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital. \"There's a clear path to a soft landing and the Fed may very well be coming to the market's rescue in as little as three months.\"\n\nInflation has remained stickier than the Federal Reserve would like, and the release just hours before the Fed announces the decision of its two-day meeting in Washington is unlikely to change its policy of holding interest rates higher for longer. But the positive reading for May could raise some hope that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will be more dovish in his comments when he talks to the press after the announcement at 2 p.m.\n\nWhile the economy has seen considerable improvement in inflation, which peaked at 9% in the middle of 2022, especially in the goods sector of the economy, it is proving more difficult to tame price increases for services such as pet care, auto insurance and rents.\n\nAt the same time, the economy has proven more resilient to higher interest rates as many homeowners sit on low-rate mortgages taken out during the COVID-19 pandemic and corporations are less reliant on bank borrowing than they have been in the past. And the labor market continues to create jobs, with 272,000 added in May.\n\nMarkets are now pricing in two cuts to interest rates this year, down from the six expected at the beginning of 2024. The Fed will update its own forecast for the economy and interest rates later Wednesday. That should provide some insights into how Fed members view the current stance of interest rate policy.\n\n\"The labor market remains strong,\" says Erik Aarts, senior fixed income strategist at Touchstone Investments. \"It's not giving the Fed a reason to do anything.\"\n\nThe World Bank on Tuesday raised its forecast for the global economy, upping the rate of growth this year to 2.6% from 2.4% and crediting strength in the U.S. economy for its upgrade.\n\nThe central bank remains committed to its 2% annual inflation target, a number that is below where most inflation data has come in during the past few months. Both the European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada recently lowered interest rates but also the ECB increased its inflation projections.\n\n\"The updated summary of economic projections will likely show weaker growth and stronger inflation this year, but we do not anticipate any material changes to the forecasts for 2025 and 2026,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics said. \"The Fed's forecast for headline and core PCE deflators are a little rosy. With the data coming in stronger than anticipated since the March projections, the Fed will need to revise its forecasts higher. The upward revision may bleed into 2025, where the Fed already has inflation a touch above its target.\"\n\nInflation remains a pressing concern for most consumers, as a TransUnion survey released Wednesday morning shows. The second quarter consumer pulse survey from the credit scoring firm found that worries about inflation and interest rates reached their highest levels in two years, with 84% of those surveyed listing prices of everyday items like food and groceries as their main concern. That is 5 points higher than a year ago, even though the pace of inflation has slowed since then and gas prices have actually been coming down.\n\nAt the same time, a majority or 55% are optimistic about their own financial condition.\n\n\"Inflation appears to be getting better but consumers continue to feel worse about it,\" says Charlie Wise, senior vice president and head of global research at TransUnion.", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index",

Despite modest improvements in inflation, strong job growth supports a 'no-rush' stance. Analysts foresee up to two rate cuts by year-end, influenced by low inflation readings and economic uncertainties.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, with new economic projections from the U.S. central bank's policymakers likely to show fewer rate cuts this year than previously anticipated. Fed officials received some welcome news on inflation as they continued their two days of deliberations when the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the\n\nconsumer price index was flat on a month-to-month basis in May, and the annual pace of price increases slowed to 3.3% from 3.4% in the month before.\n\nExcluding volatile food and energy costs, the core index slowed to 3.4% last month from 3.6% in April. The Fed's efforts to lower inflation to its 2% target had shown only modest improvement this year through April, and policymakers have been reluctant to put much weight on individual data points.\n\nWith strong job growth allaying concerns of a weakening economy, analysts expect the central bank to maintain its \"no-rush\" attitude towards rate cuts on Wednesday, leaving the benchmark policy rate in the 5.25%-5.50% range that was set last July. But the low inflation read for May prompted investors at least to lock in views for a quarter-percentage-point rate cut in September and a second such move in December.\n\nThe Fed's policy statement is due to be released at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), with Powell speaking to reporters half an hour later. Given the slower progress on inflation this year, many analysts expect the Fed's \"dot plot\" projection for its benchmark policy rate to show just two quarter-percentage-point rate cuts by the end of this year, versus the three anticipated as of March - if only to account for the lapse of time.\n\nBut the median could easily tip to only one cut among a nearly evenly divided group of policymakers. \"If there is any risk ... it's that there will be only one 25-basis-point rate cut this year,\" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist for RSM US, with Powell using his press conference to \"manage expectations\" at a point where Fed policymakers feel particularly uncertain about the path the economy may follow.\n\n'WELCOME DECELERATION' Powell and other policymakers have minimized the risk of a further rate increase. The Fed aggressively raised rates in 2022 and 2023 after inflation surged to a 40-year peak.\n\nThe personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, has declined from a 7.1% peak annual pace in June 2022 to 2.7% as of April. The current policy rate is regarded as restrictive enough to discourage investment and spending and gradually return inflation to the Fed's target. Yet policymakers are not ready to commit to any cuts until they've seen more progress. Just as they acknowledge risks that unemployment could rise fast and warrant rate cuts to support the economy, they see aspects of inflation, particularly in housing and the broad services sector, that may have stalled at too high a level.\n\nThe latest CPI report could help allay that concern. \"Price pressures remain elevated but showed a welcome deceleration last month,\" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics.\n\nStill, she added that \"policymakers need to see more than one data point on inflation that shows a sustainable path towards 2% before cutting rates this year.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benchmarking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_consumption_expenditures_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal consumption expenditures price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frequency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tertiary sector of the economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/28_05_2024_04_57_13_1955595.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

The committee also signaled that it believes the long-run interest rate is higher than previously indicated.\n\nNew forecasts released after this week's two-day meeting indicated slight optimism that inflation remains on track to head back to the Fed's 2% goal, allowing for some policy loosening later this year.\n\n\"Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated,\" the post-meeting statement said, echoing language from the last statement. In the only substantive change, the new statement followed with, \"In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.\"\n\nThe previous language said there had been \"a lack of further progress\" on inflation.\n\nThe committee, in its closely watched \"dot plot\" of individual participants' rate expectations, did indicate a more aggressive cutting path in 2025, with four reductions totaling a full percentage point anticipated, up from three.\n\nFor the period through 2025, the committee now sees five total cuts equaling 1.25 percentage points, down from six in March. If the projections hold, it would leave the federal funds rate benchmark at 4.1% by the end of next year.\n\nAnother significant development occurred with the projection for the long-run rate of interest, essentially a level that neither boosts nor restricts growth. That moved up to 2.8% from 2.6%, a nod that the higher-for-longer narrative is gaining traction among Fed officials.\n\nIn a further indication of a hawkish bent from central bankers, the dot plot showed four officials in favor of no cuts this year, up from two previously.\n\nElsewhere in the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections, participants raised their 2024 outlook on inflation to 2.6%, or 2.8% when excluding food and energy. Both inflation projections were 0.2 percentage point higher than in March.\n\nThe Fed's preferred inflation gauge is the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures price index, which showed respective readings of 2.7% and 2.8% for April. The Fed focuses more on core inflation as a better long-term indicator. The SEP indicates inflation returning to the 2% target, but not until 2026.\n\nThe decision and informal forecasts from the 19 meeting participants come during a volatile year for markets and investors' hopes that the Fed would start easing after it raised benchmark rates to their highest level in some 23 years.\n\nThe federal funds rate, which sets overnight borrowing costs for banks but feeds into many consumer debt products, is targeted in a range between 5.25%-5.5%, the result of 11 rate increases between March 2022 and July 2023.\n\nEarlier in the day, as Fed officials were preparing their economic and rate outlooks, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the consumer price index for May. The report showed that inflation was flat on the month while the annual rate edged lower from the rate in April to 3.3%.\n\nThat's still well above the Fed's 2% target but also considerably below the peak of just over 9% seen nearly two years ago. Core readings excluding food and energy prices were at 0.2% from the prior month and 3.4% from the year-ago period.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, economic data softened from where it had been for most of the previous year, with GDP rising at just a 1.3% annualized pace. April and May have been a mixed bag for data, but the Atlanta Fed is tracking GDP growth at 3.1%, a solid pace especially in light of persistent recession worries that have dogged the economy for the past two years.\n\nInflation data, though, has been equally resilient and has posed problems for central bankers.\n\nThe year began with markets expecting a vigorous pace of rate cuts, only to be thwarted by sticky inflation and statements from Fed officials that they are unconvinced that inflation is heading back convincingly to target.", "source": {"uri": "nbcphiladelphia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC10 Philadelphia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_consumption_expenditures_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal consumption expenditures price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/06/107409037-17145892582024-05-01t184544z_1052945606_rc2uh7a3ktmz_rtrmadp_0_usa-economy-fed_fb97ee.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Analysts predict that the Fed's benchmark interest rate will likely remain between 5.25% to 5.5%, where it has stood for nearly a year. Despite initial expectations of multiple rate cuts in 2024, persistent inflation has prevented the Fed from making any changes. The market will closely watch Fed chair Jerome Powell's press conference for any hints on future rate actions.\n\nWhile inflation remains a concern, recent data shows that the U.S. economy is still growing, albeit at a slower pace. The unemployment rate in May rose to 4%, indicating a potential slowdown in hiring. Additionally, the economy produced $22.7 trillion worth of goods in the first quarter of 2024, contributing to a 1.3% GDP growth.\n\nInflation continues to linger above the Fed's 2% target, with the annual rate hovering around 3% to 3.5%. Factors such as high rent prices and strong wage growth are contributing to this elevated inflation. The Fed remains cautious about cutting interest rates until there is clearer progress towards reaching their inflation target.\n\nDespite the lack of a rate cut in this meeting, the Fed has several more opportunities throughout the year to adjust interest rates. The stock market reacted positively to the news of stable inflation, with major indices reaching record highs. While a rate cut may not be imminent, analysts are closely monitoring inflation data for potential future actions by the Federal Reserve.\n\nOverall, the Fed's decision to keep interest rates steady reflects the ongoing challenge of managing inflation while supporting economic growth.

Inflation currently sits at 3.3% year over year, according to today's Consumer Price Index's report.\n\nMoving inflation sustainably toward the central bank's goal of 2% will likely require more than a month or two of lower inflation reports, which has dimmed hopes for interest rate cuts by this summer.\n\nThe Fed had penciled in three interest rate cuts at the end of 2023. But with just four meetings left this year -- in July, September, November and December -- the window is closing for multiple rate cuts, if any.\n\nWe'll update this story with comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who's scheduled to give a news conference starting at 2:30 p.m. ET.\n\nFed Day Live Blog: Stay up-to-date on inflation news, the Fed's rate decision and expert takes on what's next.\n\nRaising interest rates is one of the primary strategies the Fed can use to help control inflation, has hovered around 3% this year, above the Fed's target rate of 2%\n\nThe Fed is tasked with striking a balance between economic growth and rising prices. When inflation spiked in 2022, the Fed attempted to rein in soaring prices by raising the federal funds rate -- that's the interest rate banks charge each other for borrowing and lending. Raising the federal funds rate makes borrowing more expensive for both businesses and individuals, thus slowing down the economy.\n\nBut persistent inflation and a strong jobs market -- the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported last week that the US added 272,000 jobs, well above estimates -- hasn't given the Fed much in the way of evidence that the economy needs interest rate cuts.\n\nHowever, if interest rates remain too high for too long, it could create a drag on the economy as employers pull back on hiring and consumers stop spending. And while two CPI reports do not make a trend, if inflation continues to abate through the summer, the Fed might consider it the evidence it needs to make at least one interest rate cut.\n\nMany experts expect the Fed will begin dropping rates by the end of 2024, so long as inflationary pressures continue to ease.\n\nOverall, it's unlikely we'll see relief from high interest rates any time soon. That means you can expect borrowing to remain high, but savings rates will also stay elevated.\n\nMortgages: Don't expect to see average mortgage rates drop below 6% for a while. But if you're ready to buy a home, don't let interest rates alone dictate your decision.\n\nSavings: If you don't have an emergency fund, now is a good time to start setting aside even a little bit each month to grow your savings. And the good news is that savers can take advantage of higher interest rates by stashing their money in CDs or high yield savings accounts -- the tops ones currently offer APYs of 5% or more.\n\nCredit cards: Credit card debt will remain expensive, regardless of how the Fed votes on the federal funds rate.

And it's expected to reiterate its view that inflation remains too high for, and presents too much of a growth risk to, the world's biggest economy.\n\nThat position, expected to be sketched out in detail through fresh growth and inflation projections from Fed officials on Wednesday, is likely to find further support from inflation data and market expectations even before Chairman Jerome Powell speaks to the media at 2:30 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time.\n\nThe Commerce Department will publish its first estimate of May consumer price inflation prior to the market open on Wednesday. Some economists suggest it could indicate moderating core and headline pressures that are likely to extend into the summer months.\n\n\"We look for a relatively firm increase in core CPI inflation that keeps year-ago inflationunchanged,\" JP Morgan analysts led by Michael Feroli wrote earlier this week.\n\n\"While we continue to expect further cooling in inflation this year -- and notably the Fed is focused on PCE inflation, which is running below CPI -- the current pace may leave various participants still concerned about lack of further progress.\"\n\nEasing headline figure; sticky core\n\nWall Street expects to see the headline reading hold at an annual rate of 3.4%, but ease notably to 0.1% when compared with April levels.\n\nSo-called core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is likely to ease to 3.5% on the year and hold at 0.3% on the month.\n\nThose levels are still a long way from the Fed's 2% target, and although Powell and his colleagues have said they could start cutting rates prior to reaching that threshold, they would still prefer to see \"several months\" of data that confirm a slowing inflation trend.\n\nRelated: Surprise jobs report pummels Fed rate-cut bets\n\nThat could be difficult in an economy that added 272,000 new jobs last month, a bigger-than-expected tally that included robust wage gains of 0.4%, and a current-quarter estimate from the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tool that suggests growth rate of 3.1%.\n\nSmall-business hiring plans, meanwhile, jumped to the highest level of the year last month, according to the National Federation of Independent Business's benchmark survey. Its broader optimism index recorded its second-consecutive monthly gain.\n\nStrong services sector\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management's benchmark index for activity in the services sector, the biggest component of U.S. growth, also impressed in May, rising to a nine-month high of 53.8 points as inflation pressure eased.\n\nThat could give the Fed deeper confidence that its long run of rate hikes, is having the desired, if prolonged, impact on inflation while allowing the economy to continue to grow.\n\n\"Last Friday's jobs report showed a domestic labor market that continues to follow the soft-landing blueprint by the book so far,\" said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede.\n\n\"Once investors gain firmer confidence in a return to price stability, markets may begin to adjust interest rates lower to account for an incrementally less restrictive Fed,\" he added.\n\nRelated: The Fed doesn't want to talk about stagflation. It might not have a choice.\n\nPowell would, of course, welcome such a soft-landing scenario into the second half, particularly if it means the Fed can avoid the political maelstrom of the autumn presidential race and pass on any rate decision during their September and November meetings.\n\n\"The Fed views monetary policy as restrictive and will keep rates higher for longer at these levels until they have confidence that inflation can sustainably get back to their target,\" said John Madziyire, head of U.S. Treasurys and TIPS and senior portfolio manager at Vanguard.\n\n\"The market is currently pricing in the first cut in December, but we are not forecasting any in 2024,\" he added.\n\nCME Group's FedWatch pegs the odds of a September cut at just 48%, with the chance of a follow-on move in December trading at similar levels.\n\nCentral bank wiggle room\n\nThat said, recent rate cuts from both the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank, as well as likely easing this week from the Bank of England, could provide cover for the Fed to deliver one rate reduction.\n\nThat would be an effort to ensure that consumers don't bear the brunt of its inflation-fighting policies while Wall Street celebrates record-high stock prices.\n\n\"We might need to wait until Fed governors get an earful over Thanksgiving dinner before we see rates cut,\" said Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager at Sit Investment Associates. \"People will be pretty sick of 22% credit card rates and 7.5% mortgage rates by then, given the loss of any kind of savings safety net.\"\n\n\"The Fed has a dentist's mentality, believing that pain now will save you suffering down the road,\" he added. \"They are oblivious to how high interest rates are driving up costs for businesses that are being passed onto the consumer.\"\n\nRelated: Goldman Sachs forecasts what's next for the Fed's rate outlook\n\nConsumers are indeed pushing back on relentless price hikes from major brands such as McDonald's (MCD) , Starbucks (SBUX) and Kraft Heinz (KHC) , with some evidence that they're also running-down their pandemic-era savings.\n\n\"The top 20% are in great shape with their high incomes meaning inflation is more of an irritation rather than a severe constraint,\" said ING's chief international economist, James Knightley.\n\n\"It is a very different situation for those lower-income households where high inflation has been a much greater burden and financial strains are emerging with credit-card and auto-loan delinquencies rising sharply.\"\n\nThat said, they're also expecting softer inflation pressures over the coming year.\n\nThe New York Fed's monthly survey of year-ahead inflation expectations eased to 3.2% last month, while the three-year projection held at 2.8%, a rate similar to that seen prior to the 2020 pandemic.\n\nMore Economic Analysis:\n\n\"The economic tug-of-war is between a relatively strong consumer and higher than comfortable inflation,\" said Jeff Klingelhofer, co-head of investments at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, N.M.\n\n\"While indicators show signs the battle is coming to a conclusion, it's not clear which side will be victorious,\" he noted. \"I would like to hear Chair Powell reiterate that rates are in restrictive territory and emphasize patience.\"\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for

The Fed aggressively raised rates in 2022 and 2023 after inflation surged to a 40-year peak.\n\nThe personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, has declined from a 7.1 per cent peak annual pace in June 2022 to 2.7 per cent as of April. The current policy rate is regarded as restrictive enough to discourage investment and spending and gradually return inflation to the Fed's target.\n\nYet policy-makers are not ready to commit to any cuts until they've seen more progress. Just as they acknowledge risks that unemployment could rise fast and warrant rate cuts to support the economy, they see aspects of inflation, particularly in housing and the broad services sector, that may have stalled at too high a level.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters expect the consumer price index rose only 0.1 per cent in May, which would be the weakest reading since October, with \"core\" prices excluding food and energy forecast to increase 0.3 per cent. The U.S. Labor Department is due to release the CPI report at 8:30 a.m. EDT.\n\nWhile the year-over-year CPI rates are expected to show no or little change from April, the report's details should be seen \"as a step in the right direction,\" after inflation surged more than expected earlier in 2024, BNP Paribas economists wrote.\n\nIn their final comments before the latest policy meeting, a number of central bank officials, including Fed Governor Christopher Waller, said they needed to see several more months of improving inflation data before deciding to cut rates, statements investors have construed as pushing back any rate reduction to the Fed's Sept. 17-18 meeting at the earliest.\n\nEven that start date for the policy easing is a virtual toss-up.

Treasury two-year yields, which are more sensitive to imminent Fed moves, slumped 15 basis points to 4.68%. The dollar fell. Fed swaps now fully price in quarter-point rate cut in November -- and bets on a September reduction also rose.\n\nThe so-called core consumer price index -- which excludes food and energy costs -- climbed 0.2% from April, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures showed. The year-over-year measure rose 3.4%, cooling to the slowest pace in more than three years, according to data out Wednesday.\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to hold its benchmark rate steady for a seventh consecutive meeting Wednesday. The rate decision, and the projections, will be released at 2 p.m. in Washington. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference 30 minutes later.\n\nWall Street's Reaction to CPI:\n\nAs we hear from the Fed later today, today's inflation data should be another feather in the cap for Chairman Powell and raise the confidence for the rest of the voting members. More importantly, as we look further out on the calendar, the distance from here to the first rate cut of the cycle appears to be rapidly approaching.\n\nUS inflation has proven sticker than anticipated so far in 2024, so today's print will be welcomed by the market. That said, it may be premature to extrapolate this single data point and we would expect the Fed to continue to exert caution, with the prospect of limited rate cuts over the remainder of this year. Ongoing data will continue to be scrutinised as the underlying economic picture emerges.\n\nThe cool inflation numbers should boost investor confidence for a Fed rate cut in the second half of 2024, but will the Fed throw gasoline or cold water on the fire when it comes to rate cuts?\n\nToday's inflation report is a step in the right direction as investors look for clues from Chair Powell on what the Fed's next steps might be.\n\nThe Fed's last mile toward price stability is getting shorter.\n\nThis should help the FOMC, today preparing its dot plot and fine tuning its statement, offer a more positive view regarding monetary easing despite invoking their well-practiced reminder that they remain data dependent and require additional confirmation that inflation continues to trend lower.\n\nSofter inflation is good news for the Federal Reserve. Despite a good report this morning, the Fed will still likely communicate this afternoon their intentions to keep rates higher for longer in their updated summary of economic projections. The updated dot plot will likely signal only two rate cuts this year, a change from the three cuts communicated back in March.\n\nDisinflation is back -- the bump up in inflation data over the past few months is proving to be temporary. That makes life so much easier for the Federal Reserve: employment is strong, and inflation is dropping.\n\nInflation is slowing even as the economy accelerates. Things are playing out as the Fed hoped, so Jerome Powell will probably be feeling good this afternoon. September could be back in play for a rate cut. The bears have nowhere to run to and nowhere to hide.\n\nMay CPI was softer than expected across headline and core readings, indicating the disinflation process is playing out. This keeps the Fed on track for cuts in 2024, with the first cut likely coming in September, especially with the unemployment rate at 4% and risk of going higher.\n\nDisinflation strikes back. While these figures are unlikely to influence today's Fed decision, they could be significant for the July meeting. Expectations of lower rates should bolster equities and bonds.\n\nToday's soft CPI puts the Fed back in the driver's seat to steer towards a precautionary cut later this year to ensure recession remains remote. Until greater disinflation evidence is seen both in breadth and depth, today's softness is supportive of a preemptive cut rather than a pivot in Fed policy towards accommodation.\n\nOverall, it was a universally softer read on inflation than the market was expecting. Moreover, it clears the path for the 'dot plot' to signal 50 bp of cuts in 2024 and ensures that Powell will offer a dovish tone.\n\nThis fall provides evidence that monetary policy is having its intended effect and brings the economy one step closer to the Fed's target of 2%. If inflation drops consistently in the coming months, central bankers should be convinced to finally reduce interest rates.\n\nChances of a 2024 rate cut remain balanced. Inflation is certainly not raising, but neither is it falling fast.

Will It Be a Game Changer?", "body": "Federal Reserve officials are poised to announce their rate decision and economic projections mere hours after the latest inflation release.\n\nFederal Reserve officials insist that they are \"data dependent\" as they craft interest rate policy. This month, the data they depend on is coming at the last possible moment.\n\nAmerica's latest inflation reading -- the Consumer Price Index report for May -- will come out at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, just hours before the Fed releases its policy decision and new economic projections at 2 p.m.\n\nThere is little chance that the inflation data will change the Fed's plans for this month. Officials are widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged, no matter what happens. But the fresh inflation reading could help shape officials' estimates of how many times they will cut rates this year, because policymakers will have a chance to update their forecasts in response to the data.\n\nPolicymakers came into the year expecting to lower interest rates three times in 2024, but economists expect the Fed on Wednesday to change those projections to predict two cuts. Some see a small chance officials could project just one rate reduction.\n\nThe Fed's increased wariness around rate cuts has come as inflation has proved surprisingly stubborn. While it is down sharply from its peak -- the C.P.I. measure topped out at 9.1 percent in 2022 -- central bankers have been concerned by a recent lack of progress. Inflation fell steadily in 2023, but it has recently plateaued.\n\nWednesday's report will show whether that stickiness persists. Economists in a Bloomberg survey expect that the overall price index probably climbed 3.4 percent from a year earlier, matching the April reading. A measure of \"core\" inflation that strips out volatile food and fuel prices is probably running at 3.5 percent. That would be slightly slower than 3.6 percent in April.\n\nThe Fed defines its 2 percent annual inflation goal using a different but related measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, which comes out later in the month and stood at 2.7 percent in April.\n\nSlower progress on inflation has not been enough to prod Fed policymakers to raise interest rates further, but it has spurred them to hold off on lowering interest rates. Policymakers have been clear that in a solid economy with a strong job market, they have the wiggle room they need to wait for inflation to restart its decline before they lower interest rates.\n\n\"We will need to be patient and let restrictive policy do its work,\" Jerome H.

This decision reflects ongoing efforts to control inflation, despite modest progress toward their 2% target. The move suggests higher rates are needed longer-term.\n\nThe Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday and pushed out the start of rate cuts to perhaps as late as December, with officials projecting only a single quarter-percentage-point reduction for the year amid rising estimates for what it will take to keep inflation in check. The markdown in the outlook for rate cuts, from three quarter-percentage-point reductions seen in the Fed's March projections, occurred despite the central bank's acknowledgement in its new policy statement of \"modest further progress\" towards its 2% inflation target - an upgrade from its May 1 statement. It likely removes the possibility of a rate cut before the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe move also coincided with an increase to 2.8% in the estimated long-run, or \"neutral,\" rate of interest from 2.6%, which indicates policymakers have concluded the economy needs more restraint to finish the battle against rising prices. Recent progress has been slow, and Fed officials now project a slightly higher end-of-year inflation rate of 2.6% versus the 2.4% anticipated as of March.\n\nU.S. stocks held gains immediately following the release of the statement and updated projections while the U.S. dollar and U.S. Treasury yields pared losses. Traders of rate futures continued to price in a September start to the Fed's policy easing, with a second cut likely by the end of the year. \"The market cares more than the economy does about whether there are two cuts this year or only one,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"The Fed is basically rearranging the rate-cut deck chairs.\"\n\nWhile rate cuts are now seen getting a likely later start and a slower pace this year than investors have anticipated, the Fed's policy rate is seen falling fast next year, with reductions of a full percentage point in both 2025 and 2026. The Fed's statement and new Summary of Economic Projections show a central bank wrestling over how to respond to data that many read as pointing to slower inflation - consumer prices in fact did not rise at all in May on a month-over-month basis, according to data released on Wednesday - but also to steady growth and job creation.\n\nHIGHER NEUTRAL RATE The new projections show the economy is still expected to grow at a slightly above-trend 2.1% this year despite a sluggish first quarter, and the unemployment rate will remain at its current 4% through the year.\n\n\"Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Job gains have remained strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low,\" the Fed said in a statement that was approved unanimously. Following little progress on inflation over the first months of the year, the result was a \"dot plot\" of projected policymaker interest rate forecasts that involved nearly an across-the-board shift higher in the rates considered needed to finish the battle against inflation.\n\nCoupled with recent debate over the possibility that the neutral rate of interest was higher than estimated, the new dot plot suggested Fed officials have concluded higher rates are needed over a longer period of time to keep inflation in check. Summed with a previous increase in the March projection, that neutral rate is now estimated at more than a quarter of a percentage point above where it ended 2023. The Fed aggressively raised rates in 2022 and 2023 in response to a surge in inflation that peaked at a 40-year high some two years ago.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. EDT (1830 GMT) to discuss the outcome of the latest two-day meeting.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@devdiscourse.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_plot_(statistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dot plot (statistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Travel", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/28_05_2024_13_02_51_5644752.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 921, "textEnd": 926}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 997, "textEnd": 1003}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

That rate of pay increase exceeds the pace of inflation, indicating that the spending power of workers has grown even as prices jump.\n\nThe data marks a boon for workers but could give pause to policymakers, since they fear that a rise in pay could prompt businesses to raise prices in order to cover the added labor cost.\n\nEconomic output slowed markedly at the outset of 2024, though it continued to grow at a solid pace.\n\nWhile the Fed has resisted lowering interest rates, consumers have faced high borrowing costs for everything from mortgages to credit cards.\n\nThe average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage stands at 6.99%, according to Freddie Mac data released last week.\n\nWhen the Fed imposed its first rate hike of the current series in March 2022, the average 30-year fixed mortgage stood at just 3.85%, Freddie Mac data showed.", "source": {"uri": "weisradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WEIS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vanguard_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Vanguard Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Mac", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Mac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richter magnitude scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://weisradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Getty_061224_ApplesGroceryStore.PNG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

As a result, CPI has gone nowhere in a year. It's a maddening, sticky, stubborn situation.\"\n\nOther parts of the report are also expected to point to a slower retreat in inflation. Core prices, which exclude the more volatile measurements of food and energy, are projected to climb 3.6% annually. That figure is up slightly from the 3.5% headline gain in April, suggesting that underlying price pressures remain strong.\n\nThe Fed's target rate is 2%, although central bank policymakers tend to rely on a different inflation metric known as the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE.\n\nThe Labor Department is set to release the data at 8:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday.\n\nFed officials are widely expected to hold interest rates steady at a range of 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest level in 23 years.\n\nHowever, investors are even more laser-focused on the updated quarterly economic projections that will be released after the Fed's meeting, which will include a forecast of where policymakers expect their key rate to be at the end of 2024.\n\nEconomists expect the Fed to adjust the so-called dot plot to show there could be two rate reductions this year, instead of the three that policymakers penciled in at their March meeting. Other changes that economists think will be made to the projections could include softer economic growth and higher inflation at the end of the year.\n\n\"All eyes will be on the dot plot, which in March showed that the median projections for the Fed funds rate at the end of 2024 was 4.6%, implying three rate cuts. Those projections now appear almost quaint, naive and wildly over-optimistic,\" North said. \"It is likely that Wednesday's projections will now show only two cuts in 2024.\"\n\nExperts also say they will be closely watching Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET to see whether he provides any clues about the future path of monetary policy. Powell is expected to stick to his message that policy is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle but that the central bank needs more evidence inflation is conquered before it pivots to reductions.\n\n\"We do not expect any significant changes to the FOMC statement or Chair Powell's message at the June meeting,\" said Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle. \"The most notable theme of Powell's last press conference in May was his pushback against possible rate hikes, but talk of hikes has died down in markets since then.\"\n\nPolicymakers raised interest rates sharply in 2022 and 2023 to the highest level since the 1980s in a bid to slow the economy and cool inflation.\n\nFed officials are now grappling with when they should take their foot off the brake.\n\nMost investors now expect the Fed to begin cutting rates in September and are penciling in just two reductions this year - a dramatic shift from the start of the year, when they anticipated six rate cuts beginning as soon as March.\n\nHiking federal rates tends to create higher interest rates on consumer and business loans, which then slows the economy by forcing employers to cut back on spending.\n\nHigher rates have helped push the average rate on 30-year mortgages above 7% for the first time in years.\n\nBorrowing costs for everything from home equity lines of credit to auto loans and credit cards have also spiked.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privately_held_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privately held company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_plot_(statistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dot plot (statistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_Federal_Credit_Union", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Navy Federal Credit Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_equity_line_of_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home equity line of credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/powell-federal-reserve.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1718187473&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

decision | FOX 28 Spokane", "body": "Fresh US consumer inflation data published Wednesday is unlikely to sway the Federal Reserve's plans to leave its key lending rate unchanged, but could alter how many rate cuts policymakers pencil in for this year.\n\nThe annual consumer price index (CPI) came in at 3.3 percent in May, down 0.1 percentage point from April and unchanged on a monthly basis, the Labor Department said in a statement -- slightly below expectations.\n\n\"Prices are still too high, but today's report shows welcome progress on lowering inflation,\" US President Joe Biden said in a statement after the inflation data were published.\n\nThe Republican Party, which is challenging the Democrats in November's elections, took a longer-term view of inflation, writing on X that \"prices have now risen by 20.1 percent since Biden took office.\"\n\nDespite the small drop last month, inflation remains stuck firmly above the Fed's long-term target of two percent, making it almost certain that the US central bank will vote to hold rates at a 23-year high of between 5.25 and 5.50 percent later on Wednesday, and wait for additional clarity on inflation.\n\n\"For the Federal Reserve it's very nice,\" Allianz Trade North America senior economist Dan North told AFP. \"That's what they would like to see after almost two years now of restrictive monetary policy.\"\n\nBut, he added, \"CPI has basically gone sideways for 12 months, so going from 3.4 to 3.3 (percent), it doesn't give us much.\"\n\n- Pushing back the cuts -\n\nThe US Fed has a dual mandate from Congress to tackle inflation and unemployment, and recent data suggest it remains broadly on track to manage both without pushing the United States into recession.\n\nWith cuts almost certainly off the agenda for this meeting, Wednesday's action is likely to center around the economic forecasts from the 19 members of the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which will be updated for the first time since March.\n\nAnalysts are looking to FOMC members to lower their individual forecasts for where rates will be at the end of the year in a chart known as the \"dot plot,\" bringing down the median -- or middle -- number of projected cuts this year from three down to two or fewer.\n\n\"We continue to expect the first rate cut in September,\" Goldman Sachs chief economist David Mericle wrote in a note to clients published on Sunday.\n\nHis team at Goldman sees the Fed moving to ease monetary policy every quarter after that, meaning a total of two 0.25-percentage-point cuts in 2024, and four in 2025.\n\n\"It only takes one dot moving higher to shift the median up to two 25bp (basis point) cuts -- which is our base case,\" economists at Citi wrote in a recent investor note.\n\n- Keeping September cut alive -\n\nWednesday's inflation data \"will be welcomed by Fed officials and keeps alive the prospect of the Fed starting to cut rates in September,\" Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic said in a note to clients on Wednesday.\n\n\"It could encourage some Fed officials to pencil in two rate cuts for this year, who otherwise might have been leaning towards less cuts,\" she added.\n\nOther analysts, including economists at EY and Barclays, expect the updated forecasts to show a median figure of just one rate cut for 2024.\n\n\"We think it's probably going to be more out towards the end of the year,\" Dan North from Allianz told AFP, adding that he expects the first rate cut to come only in December.\n\n\"Inflation just seems like it's really sticky, and it's putting up quite a fight,\" he continued, adding that the Fed \"always waits too long\" before starting to cut rates.\n\nFollowing Wednesday's inflation data, futures traders raised their expectations of an interest rate cut by mid-September to more than 70 percent, up sharply from less than 50 percent a day earlier, according to data from CME Group.\n\nFed chair Jerome Powell has insisted in past public comments that the FOMC will remain \"data-dependent\" in its decision-making and will not be swayed by politics.\n\nNevertheless, a September start to rate cuts would almost certainly thrust the Fed into the middle of a fractious presidential campaign between Biden and his likely Republican opponent, Donald Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the US central bank's independence.\n\nda/bfm/smw/bjt/\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox28spokane.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 28 Spokane"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_avis@fox28spokane.com",

Over the course of 18 FOMC meetings beginning March 16, 2022, I've been correct in all of my forecasts including the policy rate pause that began last September. I'm confident I'll be correct on Wednesday also.\n\nIn addition, I expect the Fed will do nothing to contradict prior indications that the rate hike cycle that began in March 2022 is over. In effect, the Fed has concluded that they've reached the terminal rate.\n\nThat's the rate at which inflation is expected to come down on its own without further rate hikes. In the Fed's view, the lagged effect of prior interest rate hikes will do the job of lowering inflation to the Fed's target of 2.0%. No further action is required. It's just a matter of time and patience.\n\nUseless Dots\n\nTomorrow's FOMC announcement will include an updated Statement of Economic Projections (SEP), known as the \"dots.\" These are forecasts of interest rates, unemployment and economic growth offered by members of the Board of Governors of the Fed, and regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents.\n\nThe dots have been wildly inaccurate in the past. Very few people take them seriously. While the dots are technically unimportant and usually wrong, they'll be played up in the media. There will be a press conference by Fed Chair Jay Powell after the meeting.\n\nThe reason for the Fed sitting tight and not cutting rates (the infamous \"pivot\" that Wall Street has been wrong about for two years) is that the Fed is losing the battle against inflation.\n\nWhen inflation (measured monthly by CPI on a year-over-year basis) dropped from 9.1% in June 2022 to 3.0% in June 2023, the Fed was ready to declare victory. The Fed's goal was still 2.0% annualized inflation, but progress from 9.1% to 3.0% was so dramatic that 2.0% seemed well within reach. It was around that time (July 2023) that the Fed hit the pause button on further rate hikes.\n\nSticky Inflation\n\nSince last July, the inflation news has been consistently bad for the Fed. Here's the tale of the inflation tape using the Consumer Price Index on a year-over year basis:\n\nDateCPI (year-over-year)June 20233.0 %July 20233.2 %August 20233.7 %September 20233.7 %October 20233.2 %November 20233.1 %December 20233.4 %January 20243.1 %February 20243.2 %March 20243.5 %April 20243.4 %\n\n(The CPI data for May 2024 will be released on June 12th, the same day as the FOMC rate policy decision).\n\nThe Trend Is Not the Fed's Friend\n\nSeveral facts jump out immediately from this most recent 11-month time series. The first is that inflation is not going down. It's higher today than it was 10 months ago. It's bounced around a bit, hitting 3.7% last September and then moving down somewhat to 3.4% today.\n\nStill, the best that can be said is that inflation is in a range with a central tendency of about 3.3%. It has been stuck in that range for almost one year and is not trending toward the Fed's stated goal of 2.0%.\n\nFor the purpose of analyzing inflation, we use the headline CPI number. The reason is simple -- that's the number that everyday Americans actually pay at the grocery store and the gas pump, so it's the best number for understanding behavioral responses, changes in expectations and political implications.\n\nThe eggheads at the Fed and Wall Street have devised \"core CPI\" (excluding food and energy), \"super-core CPI\" (excluding food, energy and housing), \"core PCE\" (a completely different index that the Fed prefers that also excludes food and energy), \"trimmed mean CPI\" (this measure disregards the highest and lowest figures as \"outliers\") and so on.\n\nThat said, when the Fed claims to be data dependent, they rely on more than just the unemployment rate and CPI. Here's a summary of recent data, some supporting a rate cut by the Fed and some suggesting the Fed should stand pat.\n\nData Supporting a Rate Cut by the FedAtlanta Fed GDP Nowcast = 3.2% (down from recent estimate of 4.2% on May 14)The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.0% in the May employment reportOil prices have trended down from $86.90 to $78.85 over the last nine weeksRegular gas at the pump has trended down from $3.64/gal to $3.47/gal in the past monthConsumer savings are largely depleted, and credit cards are maxed outHigher rates for credit cards are headwinds to consumptionHigher rates for mortgages are a headwind to home purchases and consumer durablesInverted yield-curve continues to signal a coming recessionMost job creation is in part-time jobsLabor force participation moved down from 62.7% to 62.5% in May employment reportJobs are going largely to illegal aliens.Data Supporting No Rate Cut by the FedISM index in services was strongJob creation remains solid, up by 272,000 jobs in the May employment report.Unemployment rate remains low despite recent increasesInflation is sticky with a central tendency around 3.3% over 11 months.\n\nThis data is not given equal weighting by the Fed. The inflation rate is the dominant factor in a world where job growth remains strong. Given a mixed bag of data and continuing inflation above targets, the Fed will simply do nothing.\n\nWaiting another month or two for more data is what this Fed does best. They're in no hurry to do anything right now.\n\nWhat We Don't Know\n\nWe'll learn more during Jay Powell's press conference on the Fed's future plans. At this point it's clear the Fed will not cut rates tomorrow and is unlikely to cut rates at the July 31 meeting as well. Even if inflation cools off next month the Fed will not be prepared to pivot to rate cuts.\n\nThe Fed needs to see two or three months of solid progress before reaching a level of confidence that inflation is declining enough to permit rate cuts. Over the past 11 months, inflation has been increasing.\n\nBased on this trend and the Fed's methodology, rate cuts will not happen in June and probably not at the July meeting either.\n\nSorry, Wall Street, you're going to have to wait a while longer for your beloved pivot.", "source": {"uri": "dailyreckoning.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Reckoning"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_rickards@dailyreckoning.com", "name": "James Rickards", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Encyclopedia_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Powell_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jay Powell (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_tendency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central tendency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Time series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outlier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Travel", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://dailyreckoning.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/dr-hero-img-06-11-24-shutterstock_2342788927.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 2838, "textEnd": 2847}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 4412, "textEnd": 4418}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 5900, "textEnd": 5907}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-03-", "textStart": 568, "textEnd": 576}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Policymakers came into 2024 expecting to lower rates several times, but inflation has proved surprisingly stubborn, delaying those reductions.\n\nAt the conclusion of their two-day meeting on Wednesday, Fed officials will release economic projections for the first time since March, updating how many rate cuts they expect this year. Policymakers could predict two reductions before the end of the year, economists think, down from three previously. There is even a small chance that officials could project just one rate cut.\n\nRegardless, central bankers are likely to remain coy about an important question: Just when will they begin lowering borrowing costs? Policymakers are not expected to cut rates in July, which means that they will have several months of data before their next meeting, on Sept. 17-18. Given that, officials are likely to try to keep their options open.\n\n\"It will be a message of patience, as simple as that,\" said Yelena Shulyatyeva, senior U.S. economist at BNP Paribas. \"We want to make sure that inflation is going down, and we will be happy to wait to see that happen.\"\n\nThat won't keep investors from watching a postmeeting news conference with Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, for any hint at when rates might finally start to come down -- providing relief for would-be borrowers and further pepping up financial markets.\n\nHere's what to watch at this week's Fed meeting.\n\nThe Fed puts out a statement after each of its eight meetings per year, but it includes fresh projections for inflation, unemployment, growth and interest rates only once every three months. The latest update of that Summary of Economic Projections is set for release at 2 p.m. on Wednesday.\n\nMarkets tend to focus most intently on the rate forecasts, which are often called the \"dots.\" The name comes from the presentation: Policymakers' forecasts are displayed individually as anonymous circles arrayed on a graph.\n\nThe dots will be even more in focus than usual this month, because they are almost sure to move from the last forecast. If just one official reduces his or her projection, the median dot could suggest only two rate cuts by the end of the year, down from the previous three.\n\nAs evidence mounts that rates might not come down as much or as quickly as was previously expected, a second big question is opening up. When, exactly, will cuts begin?\n\nNot right away, in all likelihood. With employers hiring, the economy expanding at a decent pace and a lot of uncertainty about how much and how quickly inflation will cool, officials have suggested that the bigger mistake would be cutting borrowing costs too early and then having to reverse course because inflation got stuck.\n\nMany economists think that today's conditions -- inflation that is moderating, if haltingly, paired with a solid economy -- will allow for a first rate cut in September. But both forecasters and Wall Street investors also see a substantial chance that the Fed won't begin to lower borrowing costs until December.\n\nThe big uncertainty headed into this meeting is exactly what is happening with inflation.\n\nOn one hand, price increases have slowed down a lot from their peak in 2022. The Consumer Price Index topped out at about 9.1 percent that year, but it is now hovering around 3.4 percent. On the other, progress has stalled out in recent months, and inflation remains above the Fed's 2 percent goal (which it officially defines using a separate but related inflation measure).\n\nFresh C.P.I. inflation data set for release at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday will give policymakers an up-to-date snapshot of what is happening with prices.\n\nOfficials will have a chance to update their economic projections after the release -- they can be revised \"until the morning of the second day of the meeting,\" per Fed rules. While the guidelines don't specify an exact cutoff time, a Fed spokesperson pointed out that the Fed chair had previously said forecasts could be updated up through midmorning of the final meeting day.\n\nBeyond that, Mr. Powell's tone could shift somewhat depending on what the latest inflation data show.\n\nFor households and for the White House, what the Fed signals at this meeting could matter.\n\nHigh interest rates are not a popular policy among American voters: They make borrowing to buy a house or a car more expensive, and for people with credit card balances, they can be a crushing expense. They also work to slow the economy and weaken the job market. While the point is to bring down inflation, the path getting there can be a painful one.\n\nIn light of that, incumbent politicians generally do not like high rates. Donald J. Trump railed against them when he was president, and while President Biden has avoided criticizing them overtly out of respect for the Fed's independence, other Democrats have not been so circumspect. After the European Central Bank cut rates last week, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and other Democrats sent a letter to the Fed chair pushing him to follow suit.\n\n\"The Fed's decision to keep interest rates high continues to widen the rate gap between Europe and the U.S., as the lower interest rates could push the dollar higher, tightening financial conditions,\" the lawmakers wrote.\n\nThe Fed says it does not take politics into account when setting interest rates, a line officials are likely to maintain this week.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNP_Paribas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BNP Paribas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy_and_Forecasting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy and Forecasting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/12/multimedia/12dc-inflation-blog-promo-bjmw/12dc-inflation-blog-promo-bjmw-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-17", "dateEnd": "-09-18", "textStart": 913, "textEnd": 924}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

According to Investing.com's Fed rate monitor, 98% of analysts believe that the American central bank will keep the benchmark rates unchanged between 5.25% and 5.50%. Additionally, today's CPI data is expected to remain largely stable compared to April, with risks still tilted to the upside. Despite the downturn recorded in the first part of the year, the economy is expected to grow again in the second quarter.\n\nIn short, while several interest rate cuts were considered certain just a few months ago, the windows for these cuts are narrowing, and now markets are expecting two cuts this year, provided that inflation does not surprise on the upside, altering the outlook once again. As always, the final word rests with the bankers, particularly with Chairman Jerome Powell, who will speak after the release of the statement. To provide clarity and understand what to expect, Investing.com has gathered analysts' comments ahead of the Fed meeting on June 12.\n\nWe believe that the policy rate will remain unchanged: 5.25% - 5.5%. Regarding some general forecasts, we expect to see modest GDP growth, a slight decrease in the unemployment rate, and rising inflation for 2024.\n\nI expect the next dot plot to show two rate cuts for 2024 (compared to the three projected in March). This is a widely agreed-upon choice, as it is generally believed that most FOMC members, including Powell, want to keep an option open for the September meeting. If the economy remains strong and inflation sticky, the market can price September based on data evolution.\n\nHowever, I foresee that it will be difficult for many participants to decide on the dot plot, given the robustness of the labor market (see the May payroll report), and for this reason, I believe the risks are tilted toward a hawkish direction, meaning the dot plot could show only one cut this year. An upside surprise in CPI data would further increase the chances of a hawkish surprise.\n\nThe distribution of dots and the central tendency will also need to be observed. This will likely confirm a committee that is almost evenly split on the number of rate cuts expected this year, indicating a high degree of uncertainty about the monetary policy outlook.\n\nAfter the May FOMC meeting, the JOLTS report suggested further cooling in the labor market, while employment was stronger than in April. Additionally, wage inflation slightly accelerated. At the same time, several GDP indicators suggest that growth in the second quarter could be more robust than the 1.3% pace of the first quarter. The conflicting data signals will result in greater monetary policy uncertainty. Specifically, whether monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive and if the Fed has much room to cut rates this year.\n\nThe consensus expects that the energy price drag will keep overall inflation contained, but core CPI is forecasted at 0.3% m/m and 3.5% y/y, still 150bp above the target. Moreover, overall inflation has remained almost flat since last summer. On Wednesday, I will be watching the costs related to residential real estate (shelter). The common view is that this measure will decline in the summer months. The FOMC will still need a slowdown in services ex-shelter to achieve its goal, but a drop in residential real estate costs would accelerate this process. If the residential sector does not slow down, I believe the FOMC will need to cut rates.\n\nAnalysts at Columbia Threadneedle Investments\n\nThe updates on inflation data and the Fed's policy meeting this week could influence market behavior ahead of the second quarter. We expect the Federal Reserve to keep rates unchanged on Wednesday. We believe that Chairman Powell and the committee will maintain a stance that emphasizes that potential rate cuts remain contingent on further progress in reducing price pressures as recognized by the Fed. Regardless of this week's inflation data, consumer and producer price trends over recent months have shown mixed progress, reassuring Fed members about their position.\n\nErik Weisman, Chief Economist, MFS Investment Management\n\nAnother full-fledged Fed quarterly meeting. We will have the statement, the famous Fed \"dots,\" the Summary of Economic Projections with forecasts for GDP, inflation, and the unemployment rate, and finally Chairman Powell's press conference. So, what should we expect?\n\nPerhaps the most important thing will be to see if the Fed considers the April consumer inflation numbers low enough to be the first month of a series of weakenings. The Fed has stated it needs to see several consecutive months where inflation is much closer to \"coming back into line\" before starting to cut rates. It is unclear if the April CPI and PCE numbers were low enough to constitute month one in this process. We may get some clarification during the press conference.\n\nRecently, both hard and soft macroeconomic data have been weaker and well below expectations. Considering the Fed's dual mandate, will this weakening macro trend increase the Fed's concern that the high policy rate is having an increasingly depressive effect on the economy? And could this accelerate the Fed's path toward beginning its rate-cutting cycle? Again, we may get some clarity on this during the press conference.\n\nAnother interesting point to examine is the long-term dots. This tells us what the Fed's neutral nominal rate is. Last quarter, the long-term median dot increased for the first time in a while. Most market participants believe the long-term neutral nominal rate for Fed funds should be significantly higher. Will the Fed continue moving in this direction?\n\nAnd as always, how many cuts does the Fed project for the rest of 2024, 2025, and 2026, and how does this align with market expectations? The market has fluctuated between predicting the first Fed cut for September or November. It will be interesting to see if the market moves more convincingly towards one starting point or the other after absorbing the Fed meeting.\n\nOur macro and market outlook remains \"cautiously constructive.\" In the United States, the significant rise in long-term rates since the beginning of the year will help moderate the growth of aggregate demand to rates more in line with the potential growth of the economy. Specifically, we anticipate expansion rates of around 2% for the entire 2024. In turn, a better balance between supply and demand, coupled with well-anchored inflation expectations, should allow for a gradual decline in core inflation in the coming months.\n\nWhile we expect few rate cuts this year and next, we also consider it highly unlikely that the Fed will be forced to raise the cost of borrowing within the same timeframe.\n\nRichard Flax, Chief Investment Officer of Moneyfarm\n\nThe day promises to be packed with events for U.S. investors, with the release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) results for May and, subsequently, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision.\n\nThe latest data on April inflation, after four consecutive months of increases, showed a gradual and continuous easing of price pressures, in line with analysts' expectations. For tomorrow, operators expect a slight decline in core inflation, which excludes the most volatile components like food and energy, from 3.6% to 3.5%, while overall inflation is expected to remain stable at 3.4%.\n\nThis would be another small step in the right direction, but it might not be enough: it appears that the rapid pace of price cooling seen last year has nearly halted, partly due to the strength of the U.S. labor market, which continues to fuel consumption despite high prices and financial burdens.\n\nThis scenario might push the Fed to maintain its wait-and-see approach: policymakers have repeatedly stated that data will guide the path of monetary policy and that without a significant downward movement in prices, it will not be possible to reduce the high financing costs in the country. With inflation well above the 2% target, the possibility that tomorrow's meeting will end with a rate cut is practically nonexistent. Analysts tend to predict that the first cut will occur only in September, followed by a second in December.\n\nHowever, if the May inflation report shows a new surge in prices, traders may need to adjust their expectations, risking a drop in stocks and bonds.\n\nJack Janasiewicz, Portfolio Manager and Lead Portfolio Strategist, Natixis IM Solutions\n\nThe day looks busy: in the morning, U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for May will be released, while in the afternoon, the FOMC decision will take place. Although the forecast for both events has stirred the market, we do not expect excessive shocks but rather moderate outcomes. Specifically, regarding inflation, we expect the broader disinflationary trend to continue intact and that the more rigid first-quarter data will prove to be just a pause in a downward trend.\n\nAs for the Federal Open Market Committee, the June meeting is highly anticipated as the committee will publish the dot plot or Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). No change in the reference rate is expected, so all eyes will be on the dot plot as investors try to glean indications about the future path of interest rates.\n\nWe can imagine a scenario where the Fed adjusts its dot plots, simply signaling its forecasts to the market, essentially discounting the recent data relative to previous projections. For example, assuming core inflation continues to follow a monthly path with average increases of +0.2% through the end of the year, year-end core PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) would rise by about 30 basis points from the current projection. This inflation outlook revision is likely enough for the Fed to shift the 2024 dot plot upward to reflect only two cuts, compared to the three in the March dot plot edition.\n\nFurthermore, if one committee member shifts their point higher by just one-eighth of a point for the 2024 federal funds rate, the median would also move higher. Overall, the 2024 median dot plot is likely to reflect only cuts by year-end, with the risk of moving to just one cut, depending on the distribution of FOMC members' estimates. A shift to two cuts would simply align with market pricing, while a dot plot showing only one cut risks surprising the markets unexpectedly compared to current consensus expectations.\n\nIn this context, it is crucial to interpret the data carefully, as this is largely a mechanical move rather than a real change in outlook or the Fed's reaction function. The SEP remains more a communication tool than an explicit policy forecast. As always, data drives decisions. The Fed is expected to remain cautious, emphasizing data dependence and the need for further evidence that the disinflationary trend is firmly in place before proceeding with rate cuts. This makes a September cut still on the table, provided the data trend in that direction.\n\nCassa Lombarda Advisory\n\nWeak data on new job offers, along with weak PMI data and a downward revision of U.S. GDP, had fueled hopes of a more imminent Fed rate cut. However, late in the week, the May jobs report exceeded estimates: last month, 272,000 jobs were created (excluding the agricultural sector) compared to the previous month, while analysts had expected an increase of 190,000 jobs. Average hourly wages increased by 14 cents, or 0.40%, against an expectation of 0.30%; these latest data suggest a still very solid labor market and resilient wage inflation, with consequent expectations of a Fed holding back.\n\nGeorge Brown, Senior U.S. Economist, Schroders (LON:SDR)\n\nWe have revised our CPI estimates for 2024 upwards, from 2.7% to 3.1%, while leaving those for 2025 largely unchanged at 2.2% from the previous 2.1%. However, given that the risks to inflation remain strongly tilted to the upside, it is difficult to say whether we will see rate cuts from the Fed this year. Any easing will be contingent on definitive proof that inflation is converging toward the target. This will not only require a sequential slowdown in inflation but also depend on a better balance of labor market conditions.\n\nOur baseline scenario assumes that progress on both fronts will be sufficient to give policymakers the confidence to cut rates. We expect the Fed to start the rate-cutting cycle in September, not June, and thus there will be only two cuts in 2024. For 2025, we continue to expect only one cut, based on our expectation that inflation will have reached the target by then and that the economy will be at full employment. There is still the risk that the cuts will be later and fewer, or that there will be none at all.\n\nDiscount of over 40%", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_plot_(statistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dot plot (statistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investing.com", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Investing.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payroll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Payroll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_wages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real wages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MFS_Investment_Management", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MFS Investment Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natixis", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natixis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Micromarketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Micromarketing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/moved_LYNXMPEI7L0F7_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 1190, "textEnd": 1197}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

It has remained at that level, the highest in 23 years, since July of 2023.\n\nThe Fed has been wary of cutting rates due to stubborn inflation, which is showing some signs of easing yet remains above the central bank's 2% annual target. Earlier on Wednesday, the government said consumer prices in May rose 3.3% on an annual basis, showing some easing from April, when the pace stood a tick higher at 3.4%.\n\nIn its statement, the Fed said there has been some \"modest\" progress of late in lowering inflation closer to its target, but added that the pace of price increases \"remains elevated.\" Inflation-weary consumers will likely have to bear higher borrowing costs throughout 2024, with the Fed adding that it's penciling in just one rate cut this year, down from the three reductions it had earlier forecast.\n\nThe Fed's rate policies affect the costs of mortgages, auto loans, credit card rates and other forms of consumer and business borrowing. The downgrade in their outlook for rate cuts would mean that such borrowing costs would likely stay higher for longer.\n\n\"The fact that the Fed scaled back the number of rate cuts from three to one is going to disappoint those who were hoping for a summer rate drop,\" said Bright MLS chief economist Lisa Sturtevant in an email. \"Mortgage rates, which have remained higher for longer, will likely remain in the high sixes until later this year.\"\n\nIn recent months, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has stated that the central bank prefers keeping rates elevated until inflation falls closer to its 2% annual target because of the risk that cutting too soon could fuel another round of price spikes.\n\nStill, the Fed's quarterly projections of future interest rate cuts are by no means fixed in time. Policymakers frequently revise their plans for rate cuts or hikes depending on how economic growth and inflation measures evolve over time.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/07/05/07b58812-fbf6-4fc6-8305-15fcffa8d577/thumbnail/1200x630/9766ad9775cfe5379e1b954797be12a7/powell-gettyimages-1258939403.jpg?v=b30c30e5b3a8744d4d8858062a9c4fa7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

They also expect inflation to be more stubborn this year than they thought in the spring, according to their forecasts.\n\nThe Fed has kept interest rates at a 23-year high for nearly a year, after kicking off an aggressive rate-hiking campaign in March 2022. Central bankers are waiting for more evidence that inflation is headed toward 2% -- and the economy's resilience is allowing them to be comfortably on hold. The Fed will begin cutting interest rates once it's clear that inflation has cooled enough and won't heat back up -- or if the job market deteriorates much more than expected, but there are currently not many signs of that.\n\nHopes for rate cuts got a boost Wednesday morning: Consumer price pressures eased in May on an annual basis. From a year earlier, inflation rose 3.3% in May, down from April's 3.4% rise and also below expectations.\n\nFed officials' latest policy statement noted that inflation has seen some \"modest further progress\" toward their 2% target in recent months, versus the May statement that noted there had been a \"lack\" of any improvements.\n\nFirst rate cut in September?\n\nWall Street's best bet for the first rate cut is currently September, according to futures, and those odds improved markedly after the release of the May CPI. For that to happen, however, inflation will have to continue to drift lower in the coming months.\n\nOfficials frequently emphasize that they are \"data dependent\" and make conclusions about the economy after data stretching over several months reveal a trend. It's unclear if the factors that resulted in hotter-than-expected inflation readings earlier this year are still lurking in the background, but the May CPI provided some relief.\n\nThe belief that components boosting inflation in the first quarter were not indicative of current cost pressures needed to be validated. May's report provides strong evidence on that front,\" Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody's Analytics, said in a note Wednesday. \"The Fed is banking it can wait a few more months until inflation falls further.\"\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has maintained his view that the central bank will likely lower borrowing costs sometime this year, even after the earlier spate of disappointing inflation reports. He frequently notes that the road to 2% will be a bumpy one and that the Fed's posture of holding steady, made easier by a strong economy, is currently their best strategy as they wait for high interest rates to take deeper hold.\n\nThe US economy remains on strong footing for now, including the job market as employers continue to hire at a brisk pace. But it's unmistakable that some US consumers are under pressure. Still-high inflation is continuing to eat into some budgets, pandemic savings are drying up, borrowers continue to pile on more debt and the highest interest rates in nearly a quarter century are squeezing Americans.\n\nThis story is developing and will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The Fed aggressively raised rates in 2022 and 2023 after inflation surged to a 40-year peak.\n\nThe personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, has declined from a 7.1% peak annual pace in June 2022 to 2.7% as of April. The current policy rate is regarded as restrictive enough to discourage investment and spending and gradually return inflation to the Fed's target.\n\nYet policymakers are not ready to commit to any cuts until they've seen more progress. Just as they acknowledge risks that unemployment could rise fast and warrant rate cuts to support the economy, they see aspects of inflation, particularly in housing and the broad services sector, that may have stalled at too high a level.\n\nThe latest CPI report could help allay that concern.\n\n\"Price pressures remain elevated but showed a welcome deceleration last month,\" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics.\n\nStill, she added that \"policymakers need to see more than one data point on inflation that shows a sustainable path towards 2% before cutting rates this year.\"\n\n(Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Paul Simao)", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UnionLeader.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_consumption_expenditures_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal consumption expenditures price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frequency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tertiary sector of the economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/unionleader.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/4e/74e74473-d016-5241-b1ca-f9878f006ac5/6669a10a472ac.image.jpg?crop=1790%2C940%2C0%2C109&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Economists expect the Fed to continue that approach on Wednesday.\n\nIn theory, the prolonged stretch of high interest rates should weigh on economic activity, reduce consumer demand and cut prices. Instead, a resilient economy and stubborn inflation have defied the Fed's efforts.\n\nInflation has fallen significantly from a peak of 9.1%, but price increases have held steady in recent months and remain more than a percentage point higher than the Fed's target rate of 2%.\n\nThe Fed has all but abandoned a previous forecast of three interest rate cuts by the end of the year.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making body on interest rates, said last month that it does not anticipate cutting interest rates until it retains confidence that inflation is moving sustainably downward.\n\n\"So far the data has not given us that greater confidence,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference in Washington, D.C., last month. \"It is likely that gaining such greater confidence will take longer than previously expected.\"\n\nSome observers expect the Fed to forgo interest rate cuts for the remainder of 2024.\n\nRoger Aliaga-Diaz, chief economist at the investment giant Vanguard, said in a statement to ABC News that the Fed would keep interest rates at current levels for at least the next six months.\n\nThe forecast, Aliaga-Diaz added, owes to \"inadequate progress in the inflation fight and continued growth and labor momentum.\"\n\nIn a note to clients, Deutsche Bank echoed skepticism about rate cuts anytime soon. \"Fed officials have clearly signaled that they are in a wait-and-see mode with respect to the timing and magnitude of rate cuts,\" the note said.\n\nThe Fed risks a rebound of inflation if it cuts interest rates too quickly, since stronger consumer demand on top of solid economic activity could lead to an acceleration of price increases.\n\nA prolonged period of high interest rates, however, threatens to place downward pressure on economic growth and plunge the U.S. into a recession.\n\nA jobs report released on Friday blew past economist expectations, demonstrating the resilient strength of the economy. Blockbuster hiring in May exceeded the average number of jobs added each month over the previous year, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said.\n\nAverage hourly wages surged 4.1% over the year ending in May, the report found. That rate of pay increase exceeds the pace of inflation, indicating that the spending power of workers has grown even as prices jump.\n\nThe data marks a boon for workers but could give pause to policymakers, since they fear that a rise in pay could prompt businesses to raise prices in order to cover the added labor cost.\n\nEconomic output slowed markedly at the outset of 2024, though it continued to grow at a solid pace.\n\nWhile the Fed has resisted lowering interest rates, consumers have faced high borrowing costs for everything from mortgages to credit cards.\n\nThe average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage stands at 6.99%, according to Freddie Mac data released last week.\n\nWhen the Fed imposed its first rate hike of the current series in March 2022, the average 30-year fixed mortgage stood at just 3.85%, Freddie Mac data showed.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vanguard_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Vanguard Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Mac", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Mac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richter magnitude scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/9f6aa4e7-61a0-4e8a-88ef-3b4105efc2e7/jerome-powell-gty-jt-240611_1718135126979_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Housing-related numbers have been a sticking point in the Federal Reserve's inflation battle and make up a heavy share of the CPI weighting.\n\nPrice increases were held in check, though, by a 2% drop in the energy index and just a 0.1% increase in food. Within the energy component, gas prices tumbled 3.6%. Another nettlesome inflation component, motor vehicle insurance, saw a 0.1% monthly decline though still up more than 20% on an annual basis.\n\n\"Finally, some positive surprises as both headline and core inflation beat forecasts,\" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. \"There was relief at the pump, but unfortunately home and apartment costs continue to rise and remain the main cause of inflation. Until those shelter costs begin their long-awaited fall, we won't see major drops in CPI.\"\n\nThe release comes at an important juncture for the economy as the Federal Reserve weighs its next moves on monetary policy, which will be based heavily on where inflation is heading.\n\nLater Wednesday, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee will wrap up its two-day policy meeting. Markets widely expect the Fed to keep its benchmark overnight borrowing rate targeted in a range of 5.25%-5.5%, but will be looking for clues about where the central bank is heading.\n\nFollowing the CPI release, futures traders upped the chances of the Fed cutting in September, which would be the first move lower since the early days of the Covid pandemic. However, the market outlook has been volatile, and Fed officials have stressed that they need to see more than a month or two of positive data before easing policy.\n\n\"You're going to need three more months of very friendly inflation data to cut\" in September, said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. \"If they start easing or talk about easing more, I think they're going to complicate their own their own goals of getting inflation back to 2%.\"\n\nDurable inflation has kept the Fed on the sidelines since it last hiked rates in July 2023. At the March meeting, FOMC members indicated the likelihood that they could rate cuts three times this year for a total of 0.75 percentage point, but they are expected to amend that down to either two or even just one reduction.\n\nIn addition, committee members will update their projections on gross domestic product growth as well as inflation and unemployment, all of which could be influenced by the CPI numbers. Economists expect the Fed to raise its projections for inflation and lower the outlook for broad economic growth as reflected by GDP.\n\nThough the Fed doesn't use CPI as its main inflation indicator, it still figures into the calculus.

That's making it more expensive to get a car loan, finance a business or carry a balance on your credit card.\n\nFed policymakers still expect to cut rates later this year. But forecasts released at the end of their two-day meeting show on average, policymakers anticipate just one quarter-point rate cut by year's end -- down from the three rate cuts they were forecasting in March.\n\nThe Fed has been prevented from cutting rates more aggressively because inflation has proven to be more stubborn than expected. Policymakers want more evidence that inflation is falling back towards their target of 2% before they start lowering rates.\n\nThe latest cost-of-living report, also released Wednesday, offers some encouraging signs that inflation is moving in that direction.\n\nConsumer prices in May were 3.3% higher than a year ago -- a smaller annual increase than the previous month. The consumer price index was flat between April and May, as falling gasoline prices helped to offset rising rents and restaurant prices.\n\nWhile high borrowing costs have weighed on parts of the economy -- especially the housing market -- they haven't depressed hiring so far. Employers added a robust 272,000 jobs in May and average wages were 4.1% higher than a year earlier.\n\nWages have been climbing faster than prices for over a year now, giving workers a real boost in their buying power.\n\nBut rapid wage gains can also put upward pressure on prices, making it more difficult for the Fed to control inflation.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_horsley@npr.org", "name": "Scott Horsley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7973x4485+0+415/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F4d%2F40a16c304f1bbe1a483e108d9f39%2Fgettyimages-2150466175.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

center around the economic forecasts from the 19 members of the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which will be updated for the first time since March.\n\nAnalysts are looking to FOMC members to lower their individual forecasts for where rates will be at the end of the year in a chart known as the \"dot plot,\" bringing down the median -- or middle -- number of projected cuts this year from three down to two or fewer.\n\n\"We continue to expect the first rate cut in September,\" Goldman Sachs chief economist David Mericle wrote in a note to clients published on

"title": "US consumer inflation eases ahead of Fed interest rate decision", "body": "Back in March, FOMC members penciled in a median of 0.75 percentage points of rate cuts this year\n\nFresh US consumer inflation data published Wednesday is unlikely to sway the Federal Reserve's plans to leave its key lending rate unchanged, but could alter how many rate cuts policymakers pencil in for this year.\n\nThe annual consumer price index (CPI) came in at 3.3 percent in May, down 0.1 percentage point from April and unchanged on a monthly basis, the Labor Department said in a statement -- slightly below expectations.\n\n\"Prices are still too high, but today's report shows welcome progress on lowering inflation,\" US President Joe Biden said in a statement after the inflation data were published.\n\nThe Republican Party, which is challenging the Democrats in November's elections, took a longer-term view of inflation, writing on X that \"prices have now risen by 20.1 percent since Biden took office.\"\n\nDespite the small drop last month, inflation remains stuck firmly above the Fed's long-term target of two percent, making it almost certain that the US central bank will vote to hold rates at a 23-year high of between 5.25 and 5.50 percent later on Wednesday, and wait for additional clarity on inflation.\n\n\"For the Federal Reserve it's very nice,\" Allianz Trade North America senior economist Dan North told AFP. \"That's what they would like to see after almost two years now of restrictive monetary policy.\"\n\nBut, he added, \"CPI has basically gone sideways for 12 months, so going from 3.4 to 3.3 (percent), it doesn't give us much.\"\n\n- Pushing back the cuts -\n\nThe US Fed has a dual mandate from Congress to tackle inflation and unemployment, and recent data suggest it remains broadly on track to manage both without pushing the United States into recession.\n\nWith cuts almost certainly off the agenda for this meeting, Wednesday's action is likely to center around the economic forecasts from the 19 members of the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which will be updated for the first time since March.\n\nAnalysts are looking to FOMC members to lower their individual forecasts for where rates will be at the end of the year in a chart known as the \"dot plot,\" bringing down the median -- or middle -- number of projected cuts this year from three down to two or fewer.\n\n\"We continue to expect the first rate cut in September,\" Goldman Sachs chief economist David Mericle wrote in a note to clients published on Sunday.\n\nHis team at Goldman sees the Fed moving to ease monetary policy every quarter after that, meaning a total of two 0.25-percentage-point cuts in 2024, and four in 2025.\n\n\"It only takes one dot moving higher to shift the median up to two 25bp (basis point) cuts -- which is our base case,\" economists at Citi wrote in a recent investor note.\n\n- Keeping September cut alive -\n\nWednesday's inflation data \"will be welcomed by Fed officials and keeps alive the prospect of the Fed starting to cut rates in September,\" Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic said in a note to clients on Wednesday.\n\n\"It could encourage some Fed officials to pencil in two rate cuts for this year, who otherwise might have been leaning towards less cuts,\" she added.\n\nOther analysts, including economists at EY and Barclays, expect the updated forecasts to show a median figure of just one rate cut for 2024.\n\n\"We think it's probably going to be more out towards the end of the year,\" Dan North from Allianz told AFP, adding that he expects the first rate cut to come only in December.\n\n\"Inflation just seems like it's really sticky, and it's putting up quite a fight,\" he continued, adding that the Fed \"always waits too long\" before starting to cut rates.\n\nFollowing Wednesday's inflation data, futures traders raised their expectations of an interest rate cut by mid-September to more than 70 percent, up sharply from less than 50 percent a day earlier, according to data from CME Group.\n\nFed chair Jerome Powell has insisted in past public comments that the FOMC will remain \"data-dependent\" in its decision-making and will not be swayed by politics.\n\nNevertheless, a September start to rate cuts would almost certainly thrust the Fed into the middle of a fractious presidential campaign between Biden and his likely Republican opponent, Donald Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the US central bank's independence.\n\nda/bfm/smw/bjt/\n\nMore

(FE Online)\n\nGlobal investors keep a close eye on US CPI data as a key indicator of the economy. Although US inflation dropped from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 3.4% in April 2024, the US central bank is still concerned about the stickiness. US CPI has been hovering around 3.2% over the last 6-8 months. The US Fed has stated unequivocally that the rate cut will not happen until the US CPI drops to 2%.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics releases May 2024 CPI data on June 12, 2024, at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time.\n\nIn April, the US CPI increased by 0.3 percent on the monthly count while annual inflation rose by 3.4%, a smaller increase than the 3.5-percent increase for the 12 months ending March. The core inflation index (all items less food and energy) rose 0.3 percent in April, while the annual core inflation index rose 3.6 percent over the past 12 months.\n\nForecasters predict a May inflation report showing minimal consumer price increases, primarily due to falling gasoline prices. This could lead to the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates later in the year, though the data alone is unlikely to trigger such a cut.\n\nIt is anticipated that prices will climb by 0.1% in May, which would be the lowest increase since October after rising by 0.3% in April. In other words, prices increased 3.4% annually, which is the same rate as they did in April.\n\nTherefore, the latest expectations on the consumer price index show that May inflation is likely to be down slightly from April but the year-over-year number holding steady at 3.4%. The core index, leaving out food and energy costs, is expected to decline to 3.5% from 3.6%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve may consider cutting its key interest rate later this year if cooler inflation continues, as progress on cooling inflation appears to have resumed in the second quarter.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is seeking economic data, particularly inflation reports, to confirm consumer prices are on track to a 2% annual rate before cutting interest rates. The central bank has maintained its key fed funds rate at a 23-year high since July, aiming to slow the economy and curb inflation.\n\nUS Fed's FOMC meeting is underway and the Federal Reserve Chief Powell is expected to announce no change in the policy rates on June 12 at 8 PM ET.", "source": {"uri": "financialexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Financial Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sunil_dhawan@financialexpress.com", "name": "Sunil Dhawan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Consumer Price Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Master of Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Nasdaq-Website.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 2367, "textEnd": 2374}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-06-", "textStart": 579, "textEnd": 586}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Falling gas prices kept inflation in check following a 0.3% gain in April.\n\n\"This is the best news we could've gotten this morning,\" Philip T. Powell, executive director of the Indiana Business Research Center and clinical associate professor at the Indiana University Kelley School of Business, told CNN. \"The Federal Reserve has been watching to make sure this [monthly] number came in below 0.2%.\"\n\n\"If it did, that means inflation is going to come down, which means [the Fed] could lower interest rates,\" he added.\n\nEconomists were expecting a 0.1% monthly increase and an annual gain of 3.4%, according to FactSet consensus estimates.\n\nHelping to slow inflation in May were falling gas prices, which dropped 3.6% from April. They're still up 2.2% for the year. Grocery prices were flat and overall food prices went up by 0.1%, lifted by a slight acceleration in inflation at the restaurant level.\n\nCar insurance and transportation prices fall, but housing inflation is stuck running high\n\nExcluding gas and food, categories that tend to be volatile, the closely watched \"core\" measure rose just 0.2% for the month (its slowest pace since October of last year), and its annual rate dropped to 3.4%, setting a fresh three-year low.\n\n\"Adding to the good inflation news, core services inflation (excludes energy services) printed its mildest monthly increase since September 2021,\" Kathy Bostjancic, Nationwide's chief economist, wrote in a note issued Wednesday. \"This is significant since core services inflation has been very sticky and the key reason overall inflation has not cooled more quickly.\"\n\nHowever, shelter inflation more than offset the decline in gasoline, rising 0.4% for the fourth month in a row, underscoring the pressure Americans are feeling from housing-related expenses.\n\nThe shelter index, an abstruse measurement of housing costs, has been the thorn in the side of the Fed's desire to see overall inflation return to target. (That target, by the way, is based on a separate inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, which stayed pat at 2.7% in April.)\n\nShelter's heavily weighted in the CPI, and while it doesn't fully reflect some of the slowdown seen in market-rate rents, its persistently high readings certainly do speak to the pain Americans are feeling in their biggest monthly expense.\n\n\"The one thing that sticks out in these numbers is the continued struggle with housing affordability,\" Indiana University's Powell said. \"There is so much pent-up demand out there for housing, it's not going to go away.\"\n\nTransportation services prices fell for the first time since the fall of 2021, dropping 0.5% for the month. And motor vehicle insurance prices ticked down by 0.1%, a sharp contrast from the spikes seen during the past two months.\n\nStill, those costs continue to run hot for consumers, with transportation services prices up 10.5% from a year ago and car insurance up 20.3%.\n\n\"The big and important things that households spend their money on -- food, transportation and shelter -- there's not been a lot of relief there,\" Sean Snaith, University of Central Florida economist, told CNN.\n\nSoft CPI boosts chances for Fed cuts\n\nThe CPI, which tracks average change in prices for a basket of goods and services common to consumers, is the most widely cited inflation metric.\n\nBut on Wednesday, it was merely the opening act.\n\nThe report landed just hours before the Fed was scheduled to wrap up its policymaking meeting, deliver its latest economic projections, and announce the next steps for interest rates.\n\nAlthough the softer CPI likely will be welcomed by central bankers, economists say it won't be enough to move the needle on interest rates, which are overwhelmingly expected to hold steady Wednesday (markets are seeing a mere 0.1% probability of a June cut).\n\n\"Logically, then, today's news would seem to open the door to a July rate cut, although we still think that's very unlikely given hawkish rhetoric from the Fed recently,\" Preston Caldwell, chief US economist at Morningstar, wrote Wednesday. \"But rate cuts starting by September should now be cemented as overwhelmingly likely.\"\n\nTraders seem to agree: The latest projections from the CME FedWatch Tool had the likelihood of a September rate cut at nearly 63% on Wednesday morning, jumping from 46.8% Tuesday.\n\nThe Fed on Wednesday is expected to tip its hand some with the release of the latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). The quarterly publication includes the central bankers' forecasts for key economic indicators such as inflation, GDP growth and unemployment as well as the \"dot plot,\" a chart of their expectations for interest rates.\n\nWhen the Fed released its prior SEP back in March, it showed the possibility of three cuts penciled in for the remainder of the year.\n\nEconomists expect that number to drop, given that there are fewer months left on that runway and still fairly strong economic data touching down (be it the hotter-than-expected inflation reports to start the year or the stronger-than-expected job gains).\n\n\"The CPI report for May came in a bit better than we dared hope for given the string of disappointing readings to start the year,\" Scott Anderson, chief US economist for BMO Bank, wrote in a note Wednesday. \"If sustained, it will keep Fed rate-cut expectations that we have penciled in for September and December alive and well. Restrictive monetary policy has more work to do, and the Fed will remain patient and watchful.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

This could signal a significant shift for silver traders, as inflation trends and Federal Reserve actions are closely monitored indicators in the commodities market.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Wednesday at 12:30 GMT. Analysts expect a mere 0.1% month-over-month increase in May, down from 0.3% in April. If accurate, this would reflect an annual rise of 3.4%. Core CPI, excluding food and energy, is anticipated to show a 0.3% monthly increase and a 3.5% annual rate. These figures, although modestly lower than previous months, still hover above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.\n\nA significant contributor to the lower inflation rate is the drop in gasoline prices, which fell by approximately 18 cents per gallon to an average of $3.61 in May. This decline in energy costs has provided considerable relief to consumers and is expected to reduce the headline CPI. Bank of America Securities economists highlighted that continued declines in crude prices could further suppress gas prices, maintaining downward pressure on overall inflation.\n\nDespite the cooling inflation, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to immediately cut interest rates based on May's data alone. However, a continued trend of subdued inflation could bolster the case for a rate cut later in the year. The Fed has kept its key interest rate at a 23-year high since last July to combat persistent inflation. Any future rate cuts will be contingent on consistent economic data supporting a return to the 2% inflation target.\n\nIf the Federal Reserve decides to pass on rate cuts in September, November, and December, it could put downward pressure on silver prices in the short term. High interest rates tend to strengthen the US dollar, making silver more expensive for foreign investors and reducing its appeal as a safe-haven asset.\n\nCore inflation remains a critical focus for the Federal Reserve due to its exclusion of the more volatile food and energy prices. The forecast suggests a slight dip in core inflation to a 3.5% annual rate from 3.6% in April. However, certain categories like used cars may see notable price increases, indicating mixed signals within the core metrics.\n\nGiven the current economic indicators and the potential for continued cooling inflation, the short-term outlook for silver appears bullish. Lower inflation and the possibility of interest rate cuts later in the year could boost demand for silver as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Technically, the market faces downside risks if the 50-day moving average fails as support.", "source": {"uri": "fxempire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FXEmpire.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_hyerczyk@fxempire.com", "name": "James Hyerczyk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commodity market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_indicator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic indicator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hedge (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moving average"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver_and_Flatware", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver and Flatware", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2024/06/Silver-Bull-coin-1.jpg?func=cover&q=70&width=700", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

After all, the Fed will need to balance strong payroll growth alongside falling inflation when it makes its policy decision.\n\nNot only is there a 65% of a September rate cut, but the US interest rate futures market is also pricing in a 75% chance of a second cut in December.\n\n\"As we lead up to tonight's Fed meeting, the Fed will either be king maker, or the king of disappointment for traders later today.\"\n\n8.41am: US inflation cooler-than-expected\n\nUS stocks are set to open higher after inflation came in softer than expected, increasing the prospect of an interest rate cut later this year.\n\nCore inflation, which removes volatile fuel and food prices, was 3.4% for May, softening from the prior month's 3.6% rise and coming in lower than the 3.5% analysts had predicted.\n\nHeadline CPI inflation eased to 3.3% in May from April's 3.4% and beating consensus by one tenth of a percentage point.\n\nLower-than-expected inflation will prove a boost for the Federal Reserve, which is meeting today to set interest rates and has been looking for positive data to justify a cut later this year.\n\nAll three of the US's lead stock indexes are up, according to premarket futures.\n\nIt comes after both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs on Tuesday, with the former having been boosted by Apple reclaiming its spot as the second-largest company in the world.\n\nApple shares slipped 0.7% in pre-market trading, having closed yesterday around 7.5% higher at a new record high.", "source": {"uri": "proactiveinvestors.com", "dataType": "news",

The committee also signaled that it believes the long-run interest rate is higher than previously indicated.\n\nThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept its key interest rate unchanged and signaled that just one cut is expected before the end of the year.\n\nWith markets hoping for a more accommodative central bank, Federal Open Market Committee policymakers following their two-day meeting took two rate reductions off the table from the three indicated in March. The committee also signaled that it believes the long-run interest rate is higher than previously indicated.\n\nNew forecasts released after this week's two-day meeting indicated only slight optimism that inflation remains on track to head back to the Fed's 2% goal, allowing for some policy loosening later this year.\n\n\"Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated,\" the post-meeting statement said, echoing language from the last statement. In the only substantive change, the new statement followed with, \"In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.\"\n\nThe previous language said there had been \"a lack of further progress\" on inflation.\n\nThe committee, in its closely watched \"dot plot\" of individual participants' rate expectations, did indicate a more aggressive cutting path in 2025, with four reductions totaling a full percentage point anticipated, up from three.\n\nFor the period through 2025, the committee now sees five total cuts equaling 1.25 percentage points, down from six in March.\n\nIf the projections hold, it would leave the federal funds rate benchmark at 4.1% by the end of next year, higher by 0.2 percentage point than the March outlook.\n\nAnother significant development occurred with the projection for the long-run rate of interest, essentially a level that neither boosts nor restricts growth. That moved up to 2.8% from 2.6%, a nod that the higher-for-longer narrative is gaining traction among Fed officials.\n\nIn a further indication of a hawkish bent from central bankers, the dot plot showed four officials in favor of no cuts this year, up from two previously.\n\nElsewhere in the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections, participants raised their 2024 outlook on inflation to 2.6%, or 2.8% when excluding food and energy. Both inflation projections were 0.2 percentage point higher than in March.\n\nThe Fed's preferred inflation gauge is the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures price index, which showed respective readings of 2.7% and 2.8% for April. The Fed focuses more on core inflation as a better long-term indicator. The SEP indicates inflation returning to the 2% target, but not until 2026.\n\nThe decision and informal forecasts from the 19 meeting participants come during a volatile year for markets and investors' hopes that the Fed would start easing after it raised benchmark rates to their highest level in some 23 years.\n\nThe federal funds rate, which sets overnight borrowing costs for banks but feeds into many consumer debt products, is targeted in a range between 5.25%-5.5%, the result of 11 rate increases between March 2022 and July 2023.\n\nEarlier in the day, as Fed officials were preparing their economic and rate outlooks, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the consumer price index for May. The report showed that inflation was flat on the month while the annual rate edged lower from the rate in April to 3.3%.\n\nThat's still well above the Fed's 2% target but also considerably below the peak of just over 9% seen nearly two years ago. Core readings excluding food and energy prices were at 0.2% and 3.4% respectively.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, economic data softened from where it had been for most of the previous year, with GDP rising at just a 1.3% annualized pace. April and May have been a mixed bag for data, but the Atlanta Fed is tracking GDP growth at 3.1%, a solid pace especially in light of persistent recession worries that have dogged the economy for the past two years.\n\nInflation data, though, has been equally resilient and has posed problems for central bankers.\n\nThe year began with markets expecting a vigorous pace of rate cuts, only to be thwarted by sticky inflation and statements from Fed officials that they are unconvinced that inflation is heading back convincingly to target.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_consumption_expenditures_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal consumption expenditures price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Committees", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Committees", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/06/107409037-17145892582024-05-01t184544z_1052945606_rc2uh7a3ktmz_rtrmadp_0_usa-economy-fed_fb97ee.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, was flat month-over-month and rose just 3.3% from a year ago in May, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Wednesday. That's compared to economists' consensus forecast for an 0.1% monthly increase, and a 3.4% annual jump.\n\n\"This was unequivocally a good report, a delightful appetizer while we await the main course later on today,\" Olu Sonola, Fitch Rating's head of U.S. economic research, told Fortune via email, referencing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's eagerly anticipated press conference after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting Wednesday afternoon.\n\nCore inflation, which excludes more volatile food and energy prices, also came in below economists' expectations in May, rising 0.2% month-over-month (the lowest since Sept. 2021) and 3.4% from a year ago, compared to the forecast for 0.3% and 3.5%. Some of the major contributors to inflation last month were shelter prices, which jumped 0.4% in May and 5.4% from a year ago, food prices, which rose 0.1% in May and 2.1% from a year ago, as well as motor vehicle insurance, which fell 0.1% in May, but was still up more than 20% on an annual basis. Meanwhile, gasoline and airfare prices, which fell 3.5% and 3.6% year-over-year, respectively, pulled inflation in the other direction.\n\nWall Street was quick to celebrate the cooler-than-expected inflation report, particularly its implication for Federal Reserve policy. Both the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq soared more than 1% by 10 am ET Wednesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6%. The 10-year Treasury yield also fell 0.1% to around 2.3%, hinting that fixed income investors are expecting rates to fall.\n\n\"Wednesday's weaker-than-expected CPI will allow the Fed to start cutting interest rates as soon as September,\" Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at the registered investment advisor Regan Capital, told Fortune via email. \"We have now seen multiple encouraging inflation readings, after the concerning spike in inflation earlier this year.\"\n\nEver since the Federal Reserve began lifting interest rates to fight inflation in March 2022, effectively raising borrowing costs for businesses nationwide, stock market investors have been looking forward to a shift in policy. At the start of the year, many of Wall Street's top forecasters were expecting just that in 2024, penciling in as many as six interest rate cuts. But those hopes were dashed after three hot inflation reports spooked the Fed this spring.\n\nNow, though, some believe the latest inflation report may finally provide Fed Chair Powell and company with enough evidence to begin their market and economy-juicing rate cutting cycle. The likelihood of a July interest rate cut is still slim, but, like Weinand said, September is a prime candidate.\n\nThe bond market is now pricing in a roughly 70% chance of a September rate cut, more than reversing the drop to 50% that was seen after the hot jobs report just last week, according to CME's FedWatch Tool that tracks Fed futures contracts.\n\nStill, not everyone is convinced rate cuts are now a certainty. Ashwin Alankar, head of global asset allocation at Janus Henderson Investors, said the although the CPI report will enable the Fed to consider a \"precautionary cut\" later this year, Chair Powell and company still have their reputation to uphold, and they don't want to lose the fight against inflation after years of work. That will likely keep Powell on the data dependent, wait-and-see mode script at his press conference after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"At this stage, there is no greater goal than Fed credibility to keep inflation expectations anchored, economic activity robust and financial markets friendly,\" Alankar told Fortune via email. \"Until greater dis-inflation evidence is seen both in breadth and depth, today's softness is supportive of a preemptive cut rather than a pivot in Fed policy towards accommodation.\"\n\nLindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, echoed Alankar's comments, warning that the Fed will need more than one cool inflation report to cut rates. \"It does remain challenging, however, for inflation to cool with the backdrop of the summer's heat.

It likely removes the possibility of a rate cut before the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe move also coincided with an increase to 2.8% in the estimated long-run, or \"neutral,\" rate of interest from 2.6%, which indicates policymakers have concluded the economy needs more restraint to finish the battle against rising prices.\n\nRecent progress has been slow, and Fed officials now project a slightly higher end-of-year inflation rate of 2.6% versus the 2.4% anticipated as of March.\n\nU.S. stocks held gains immediately following the release of the statement and updated projections while the U.S. dollar and U.S. Treasury yields pared losses. Traders of rate futures continued to price in a September start to the Fed's policy easing, with a second cut likely by the end of the year.\n\n\"The market cares more than the economy does about whether there are two cuts this year or only one,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"The Fed is basically rearranging the rate-cut deck chairs.\"\n\nWhile rate cuts are now seen getting a likely later start and a slower pace this year than investors have anticipated, the Fed's policy rate is seen falling fast next year, with reductions of a full percentage point in both 2025 and 2026.\n\nThe Fed's statement and new Summary of Economic Projections show a central bank wrestling over how to respond to data that many read as pointing to slower inflation -- consumer prices in fact did not rise at all in May on a month-over-month basis, according to data released on Wednesday -- but also to steady growth and job creation.\n\nThe new projections show the economy is still expected to grow at a slightly above trend 2.1% this year despite a sluggish first quarter, and the unemployment rate will remain at its current 4% through the year.\n\n\"Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Job gains have remained strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low,\" the Fed said in a statement that was approved unanimously.\n\nFollowing little progress on inflation over the first months of the year, the result was a \"dot plot\" of projected policymaker interest rate forecasts that involved nearly an across-the-board shift higher in the rates considered needed to finish the battle against inflation.\n\nCoupled with recent debate over the possibility that the neutral rate of interest was higher than estimated, the new dot plot suggested Fed officials have concluded higher rates are needed over a longer period of time to keep inflation in check. Summed with a previous increase in the March projection, that neutral rate is now estimated at more than a quarter of a percentage point above where it ended 2023.\n\nThe Fed aggressively raised rates in 2022 and 2023 in response to a surge in inflation that peaked at a 40-year high some two years ago.", "source": {"uri": "asia.nikkei.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nikkei Asia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_plot_(statistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dot plot (statistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Travel", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F9%2F2%2F5%2F7%2F47827529-11-eng-GB%2FCropped-1718217413N+Federal+Reserve.JPG?width=1260&height=630&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 604, "textEnd": 609}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 680, "textEnd": 686}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

But policymakers signaled they now expect to cut rates only once this year, compared to the three reductions forecast in March, according to the median projection.\n\nThey now see four cuts in 2025, more than the three previously outlined.\n\nTreasury yields remained lower after the statement. Traders held in place repricing that came through after the soft consumer price data earlier Wednesday that the Fed will reduce rates twice this year with the first likely move in November. The S&P 500 was higher as well.\n\nFollow the reaction in real time on Bloomberg's TOPLive blog\n\nIndividual officials' views on the best path forward for borrowing costs, however, differed. The Fed's \"dot plot\" showed four policymakers saw no cuts this year, while seven anticipated just one reduction and eight expected two cuts.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee adjusted language in its post-meeting statement released Wednesday, noting there has been \"modest further progress toward the committee's 2% inflation objective\" in recent months. Previously, the statement pointed to a \"lack\" of further progress.\n\nThe change nods to more current data showing that price growth ebbed in April and May.\n\nChair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference with reporters at 2:30 p.m. following the conclusion of a two-day meeting in Washington.\n\nFed officials have repeatedly said interest rates are likely to stay elevated for longer after price pressures picked up in the first quarter.\n\nData released earlier Wednesday offered some reassurance that progress toward their 2% inflation target has resumed. The so-called core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.2% in May and 3.4% from a year earlier, the slowest pace since 2021.\n\nBefore the decision, investors were betting the Fed would cut rates twice by year end, and saw a high likelihood of a first cut as soon as September, according to futures contracts. Other countries have already begun to lower borrowing costs. The European Central Bank cut interest rates last week, as did the Bank of Canada.\n\nFed officials also published fresh forecasts for inflation, raising their projection for underlying inflation to 2.8% from 2.6% in March.\n\nThey maintained their forecasts for economic growth and the unemployment rate at 2.1% and 4% respectively. The unemployment rate climbed to 4% in May.\n\nRestrictiveness Debate\n\nOfficials also raised their projections for where interest rates will settle in the longer term, to 2.8% from 2.6% at the March gathering. The increase, following a slight bump in March, hints policymakers expect higher interest rates are here to stay.\n\nSome officials, including Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, have said higher borrowing costs may not be slowing the economy as much as previously thought. Still others, such as New York Fed President John Williams, have said that policy is well positioned to bring inflation down to the Fed's goal.\n\nUS central bankers are engaging in a broader discussion about whether the neutral rate, or the rate at which the Fed is neither slowing nor stimulating the economy, has risen since before the pandemic. A higher neutral rate would suggest that monetary policy is not doing as much to restrain the economy.\n\nWhile US economic growth is moderating and spending is cooling, some aspects of the economy are proving more resilient to higher borrowing costs.\n\nUS nonfarm payrolls surged by 272,000 in May, surpassing all projections in a Bloomberg survey of economists, and average hourly earnings growth picked up.\n\nThe unemployment rate -- which is derived from a separate survey -- increased to 4% from 3.9%, rising to that level for the first time in over two years.\n\nThe Fed also said it would continue to shrink its balance sheet at the slower pace announced in May. Starting this month, the central bank will let its holdings of Treasury securities fall by up to $25 billion a month, down from the previous cap of $60 billion.

Falling gas prices kept inflation in check following a 0.3% gain in April.\n\n\"This is the best news we could've gotten this morning,\" Philip T. Powell, executive director of the Indiana Business Research Center and clinical associate professor at the Indiana University Kelley School of Business, told CNN. \"The Federal Reserve has been watching to make sure this [monthly] number came in below 0.2%.\"\n\n\"If it did, that means inflation is going to come down, which means [the Fed] could lower interest rates,\" he added.\n\nEconomists were expecting a 0.1% monthly increase and an annual gain of 3.4%, according to FactSet consensus estimates.\n\nHelping to slow inflation in May were falling gas prices, which dropped 3.6% from April. They're still up 2.2% for the year. Grocery prices were flat and overall food prices went up by 0.1%, lifted by a slight acceleration in inflation at the restaurant level.\n\nCar insurance and transportation prices fall, but housing inflation is stuck running high\n\nExcluding gas and food, categories that tend to be volatile, the closely watched \"core\" measure rose just 0.2% for the month (its slowest pace since October of last year), and its annual rate dropped to 3.4%, setting a fresh three-year low.\n\n\"Adding to the good inflation news, core services inflation (excludes energy services) printed its mildest monthly increase since September 2021,\" Kathy Bostjancic, Nationwide's chief economist, wrote in a note issued Wednesday. \"This is significant since core services inflation has been very sticky and the key reason overall inflation has not cooled more quickly.\"\n\nHowever, shelter inflation more than offset the decline in gasoline, rising 0.4% for the fourth month in a row, underscoring the pressure Americans are feeling from housing-related expenses. On an annual basis, shelter inflation slowed a tenth of a percentage point to 5.4%, which is its lowest rate since April 2022. However, in addition to outpacing overall inflation, the cost of shelter is running above its pre-pandemic average and the 3.3% rate in February 2020.\n\nThe shelter index, an abstruse measurement of housing costs, has been the thorn in the side of the Fed's desire to see overall inflation return to target. (That target, by the way, is based on a separate inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, which stayed pat at 2.7% in April.)\n\nShelter's heavily weighted in the CPI, and while it doesn't fully reflect some of the slowdown seen in market-rate rents, its persistently high readings certainly do speak to the pain Americans are feeling in their biggest monthly expense.\n\n\"The one thing that sticks out in these numbers is the continued struggle with housing affordability,\" Indiana University's Powell said. \"There is so much pent-up demand out there for housing, it's not going to go away.\"\n\nTransportation services prices fell for the first time since the fall of 2021, dropping 0.5% for the month. And motor vehicle insurance prices ticked down by 0.1%, a sharp contrast from the spikes seen during the past two months.\n\nStill, those costs continue to run hot for consumers, with transportation services prices up 10.5% from a year ago and car insurance up 20.3%.\n\n\"The big and important things that households spend their money on -- food, transportation and shelter -- there's not been a lot of relief there,\" Sean Snaith, University of Central Florida economist, told CNN.\n\nSoft CPI boosts chances for Fed cuts\n\nThe CPI, which tracks average change in prices for a basket of goods and services common to consumers, is the most widely cited inflation metric.\n\nBut on Wednesday, it was merely the opening act.\n\nThe report landed just hours before the Fed was scheduled to wrap up its policymaking meeting, deliver its latest economic projections, and announce the next steps for interest rates.\n\nAlthough the softer CPI likely will be welcomed by central bankers, economists say it won't be enough to move the needle on interest rates, which are overwhelmingly expected to hold steady Wednesday (markets are seeing a mere 0.1% probability of a June cut).\n\n\"Logically, then, today's news would seem to open the door to a July rate cut, although we still think that's very unlikely given hawkish rhetoric from the Fed recently,\" Preston Caldwell, chief US economist at Morningstar, wrote Wednesday. \"But rate cuts starting by September should now be cemented as overwhelmingly likely.\"\n\nTraders seem to agree: The latest projections from the CME FedWatch Tool had the likelihood of a September rate cut at nearly 63% on Wednesday morning, jumping from 46.8% Tuesday.\n\nThe Fed on Wednesday is expected to tip its hand some with the release of the latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). The quarterly publication includes the central bankers' forecasts for key economic indicators such as inflation, GDP growth and unemployment as well as the \"dot plot,\" a chart of their expectations for interest rates.\n\nWhen the Fed released its prior SEP back in March, it showed the possibility of three cuts penciled in for the remainder of the year.\n\nEconomists expect that number to drop, given that there are fewer months left on that runway and still fairly strong economic data touching down (be it the hotter-than-expected inflation reports to start the year or the stronger-than-expected job gains).\n\n\"The CPI report for May came in a bit better than we dared hope for given the string of disappointing readings to start the year,\" Scott Anderson, chief US economist for BMO Bank, wrote in a note Wednesday. \"If sustained, it will keep Fed rate-cut expectations that we have penciled in for September and December alive and well. Restrictive monetary policy has more work to do, and the Fed will remain patient and watchful.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Officials have maintained and plan to keep rates at that 23-year high for the foreseeable future until they are confident that price pressures are under control and the annual inflation rate moves closer to the Fed's 2% annual target.\n\nIf the meeting plays out as anticipated, it will be nearly an entire year of the Fed holding interest rates steady, waiting for the economy and inflation to slow down as high borrowing costs on all kinds of loans act as sand in the economic gears. However, the economy -- particularly the labor market -- has been surprisingly resilient, giving Fed officials time to sit on high interest rates.\n\nWhile the slowdown hasn't been as sharp as economists once anticipated -- there's been little sign of a long-anticipated recession -- the limbo may not last much longer.\n\nHouseholds with lower levels of income are showing signs of stress, with more people falling behind on their credit card payments, which carry the highest interest rates in decades thanks in part to the Fed's rate hikes. That's starting to drag down consumer spending as more people react to the financial pressure, especially since raises are getting harder to wring from employers.\n\n\"The economy is softening,\" Bob Schwartz, senior economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a commentary. \"Consumers, particularly the lower-income cohort, are running out of fuel, and wage growth is struggling to keep up with inflation.\"\n\n\"The combination of slowing activity and more evidence that inflation is moving sustainably towards 2% should become apparent over the second half of the year, setting the stage for the Fed to finally start unwinding its steep rate hikes,\" he added.\n\nFed officials will get a fresh view on inflation before they announce their decision on rates Wednesday, with the release of the Consumer Price Index for May.\n\nEconomists expect that inflation last month likely rose just 0.1%, which would be the smallest amount since October, thanks largely to falling gasoline prices.\n\nRegardless of what the consumer price data shows, the Fed is widely expected to stand pat on interest rates this week. As such, investors and consumers will be focused on the quarterly release of projections from officials on various economic indicators and for the fed funds rate.\n\nFed watchers will also keep close tabs on what Chair Jerome Powell says during his post-meeting press conference, looking for hints that policymakers are growing confident that inflation is tamed and rate cuts could be on the horizon.", "source": {"uri": "investopedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investopedia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Household"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cohort (statistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_indicator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic indicator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/_deXeEfrR5-J08LJV_Koif06X1M=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-2152528658-14ea765b763d42d185c639b7a9d637c2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

That would have put the policy rate in the 3.75%-4% range by the end of next year.\n\nA run of stronger-than-expected inflation earlier this year has forced U.S. rate-setters to recalibrate, writing down a slower start to rate cuts in the face of an economy proving more resilient than expected to the braking power of high borrowing costs.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how data released on Wednesday showing no rise in consumer prices in May from April may have factored into their forecasts.\n\nThe Fed has kept its target for the overnight bank-to-bank lending rate in its current range since last July in a bid to squeeze high inflation out of the economy without massive harm to the job market.\n\nFour Fed policymakers feel the Fed should not cut rates at all this year, the fresh projections show. Three months ago just two thought so.\n\nMeanwhile seven policymakers believe a single rate cut will be appropriate by year's end, compared with eight who believe two rate cuts will be needed.\n\nINFLATION RETHINK\n\nPolicymakers are now penciling in a fourth-quarter inflation rate of 2.6%, based on the year-over-year change in the personal consumption expenditures price index, which they target at 2%.\n\nThat's slightly higher than the 2.4% they saw in March, according to the projections, even as they expect to keep borrowing costs higher for longer. PCE inflation registered 2.7% in each of the last two months.\n\nThe forecasts are not a consensus view, but rather a midpoint of the individual expectations of the Federal Reserve's seven Washington-based governors and the 12 Fed bank presidents that is meant to offer some guidance on policymakers' thinking.\n\nCore PCE inflation - which strips out the cost of food and energy and which the Fed uses to gauge underlying price pressures - will be at 2.8% in the fourth quarter of 2024, and at 2.3% in the fourth quarter of 2025, according to the median projections.\n\nThat compares with the March median projection of 2.6% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025.\n\nThe economic projections suggest Fed policymakers continue to expect a so-called soft landing, where the economy slows and inflation falls without a surge in joblessness.\n\nFed policymakers do see the unemployment rate, now at 4%, rising to finish 2025 at 4.2%, higher than the 4.1% they had forecast in March.\n\nThey left their forecasts for U.S. economic growth unchanged, at 2.1% this year, and 2.0% next year.\n\nFed policymakers also lifted their estimates of the longer-run neutral rate - a policy rate that neither slows nor stimulates a healthy economy - to 2.8%, from 2.6% in March and 2.5% last December.

For 2025, inflation is estimated to be 2.3%, up from 2.2% previously.\n\nThe stickier outlook on inflation wasn't accompanied by expectations for stronger economic growth as central bank members left gross domestic product, or GDP, forecasts unchanged at 2.1% for this year and 2% for the next.\n\nOn the labor market, meanwhile, unemployment rate seen at 4% this year, unchanged from a prior forecast in March, but is now expected to pick up pace to 4.2% next year, up 0.1% from a prior projection of 4.1%.\n\nPowell's press conference at 14:30 PM ET (19:30 GMT) will likely provide further insight into the Fed's latest projections, with many keen to assess the Fed chief's view on inflation following data earlier the day showing inflation cooled more than expected in May.\n\nStocks were largely unchanged on the news, with S&P 500 hovering near record levels as data earlier in the day showing consumer inflation slowed more than expected, buoyed optimism that the disinflation trend remains on track.", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_consumption_expenditures_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal consumption expenditures price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disinflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy_and_Forecasting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy and Forecasting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/moved_LYNXMPEI5D0I0_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

The trend, if it holds, could move the Federal Reserve closer to cutting its benchmark interest rate from its 23-year peak. Consumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs - the closely watched \"core\"\u009d index - rose 0.2% from April to May, the government said Wednesday. That was down from 0.3% the previous month and was the smallest increase since October. Measured from a year earlier, core prices climbed 3.4%, below last month's 3.6% rise, and the mildest such increase in three years. Fed officials, who will end their latest policy meeting later Wednesday, are scrutinizing each month's inflation data to assess their progress in their fight against rising prices. Even as overall inflation moderates, such necessities as groceries, rent and health care are much pricier than they were three years ago - a continuing source of public discontent and a political threat to President Joe Biden's re-election bid. Most other measures suggest that the economy is healthy: Unemployment remains low, hiring is robust and consumers are traveling, eating out and spending on entertainment. And Wednesday's report indicated that consumers are beginning to get some relief from the price spikes of the past three years. Grocery costs were unchanged, on average, from April to May, after actually falling 0.2% the previous month. Food prices have risen just 1% over the past 12 months, though they're still up about 20% from three years ago. Average gas prices tumbled 3.6% nationally just from April to May, though they're 2.2% higher than they were a year earlier. Those declines have continued, with gas averaging $3.45 a gallon Wednesday, down 17 cents from a month ago. Americans didn't drive as much over the Memorial Day weekend as they have in previous years, reducing demand, and oil prices have fallen. Overall inflation also slowed last month, with consumer prices unchanged from April to May. Measured from a year earlier, prices rose 3.3%, less than the 3.6% increase a month earlier. \"It's certainly welcome news,\"\u009d said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at PGIM Fixed Income. \"It drives home that the inflation challenge in the United States is not as challenging as monetary policy makers believe.\"\u009d Later Wednesday, the Fed's policymakers are expected to reduce their forecast for interest rate cuts by year's end to two, down from three in their previous forecast in March. Before Wednesday's mild inflation figures were released, many economists worried that the Fed would predict just one rate cut this year. But most analysts said the inflation slowdown, if it continues, makes two cuts more likely, probably starting in September. \"We think this starts the clock on a potential September rate cut, but the Fed will need to see much more sustained progress in the months ahead to deliver that cut,\" Krishna Guha, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said in a note to clients. In early May, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its 2% target before it would reduce its benchmark rate. Fed officials said in recent weeks that they needed to see several consecutive months of lower inflation to gain that confidence. Small-business people are less likely to say the costs of their parts and raw materials are rising than they were a year ago, according to surveys, suggesting that they're facing less pressure to pass on higher expenses. One such businessperson is Amber Carfield, director of design at Kitchens by Good Guys, a home renovation firm near Phoenix. Carfield said the costs of cabinets, shower glass and countertops remain far higher than they were a few years ago. But price increases have eased this year, she said, particularly from two years ago, when suppliers might raise the prices of kitchen cabinets three times in a year. Before the pandemic, prices typically changed only once a year, at most. \"It's a little more manageable,\"\u009d Carfield said. \"The bleeding has stopped.\"\u009d Plumbing and electrical fixtures have started to actually fall in price, she added. \"The market is really flooded with lots and lots of options,\"\u009d when it comes to fixtures, she said. \"They are forced to be a little more competitive.\"\u009d Wednesday's inflation report showed that the prices of airfares, furniture and clothing all fell in May, helping keep inflation in check. And the cost of auto insurance, which has soared in recent months, actually dipped from April to May, though it's still up more than 20% from a year earlier. \"Prices are still too high, but today's report shows welcome progress on lowering inflation, which ... is down nearly two-thirds from its peak,\"\u009d Biden said Wednesday. The drop in auto insurance was a key reason why core inflation came in so low in May. Insurance rates have jumped because the prices of new and used cars soared during the pandemic, mostly because of supply shortages. Insurers must pay more to replace wrecked cars, and the companies have raised premiums to offset those higher costs. Pricier auto insurance is an example of how inflation has been driven largely by the lingering effects of pandemic disruptions, rather than excessive consumer demand or rising wages. Apartment rents and a measure of homeownership are another example. They're still rising faster than they did before the pandemic. But they reflect the increased demand for housing that emerged during COVID and its aftermath, when many people sought more living space. Economists point to real-time measures of new rents, which show barely any increase at all, with builders having completed a flood of new apartment buildings. The slowdown in new lease costs should feed into the government's inflation measures over time, acting as another factor lowering inflation. Other signs also suggest that inflation will continue to cool in the coming months. Americans, particularly lower-income households, are pulling back on their spending. In response, several major retail and restaurant chains, including Walmart, Target, Walgreen's, McDonald's and Burger King, have responded by announcing price cuts or deals. The Fed has kept its key rate unchanged for nearly a year after having rapidly raised it in 2022 and 2023 to fight the worst bout of inflation in four decades. Those higher rates have led, in turn, to more expensive mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other forms of consumer and business borrowing. Inflation is now far below its peak of 9.1% in mid-2022. Persistently elevated inflation has posed a vexing challenge for the Fed, which raises interest rates - or keeps them high - to try to slow borrowing and spending, cool the economy and ease the pace of price increases. The longer the Fed keeps borrowing costs high, the more it risks weakening the economy too much and causing a recession. Yet if it cuts rates too soon, it risks reigniting inflation.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@medicinehatnews.com", "name": "Canadian Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Organization_for_Women", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Organization for Women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pickup truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grocery store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_improvement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home improvement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fixed income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raw material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vehicle insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger_King", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burger King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walmart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Target Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://medicinehatnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/medicinehatnewslogo-square.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

It likely removes the possibility of a rate cut before the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe move also coincided with an increase to 2.8% in the estimated long-run, or \"neutral,\" rate of interest from 2.6%, which indicates policymakers have concluded the economy needs more restraint to finish the battle against rising prices.\n\nRecent progress has been slow, and Fed officials now project a slightly higher end-of-year inflation rate of 2.6% versus the 2.4% anticipated as of March.\n\nU.S. stocks held gains immediately following the release of the statement and updated projections while the U.S. dollar and U.S. Treasury yields pared losses. Traders of rate futures continued to price in a September start to the Fed's policy easing, with a second cut likely by the end of the year.\n\n\"The market cares more than the economy does about whether there are two cuts this year or only one,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \"The Fed is basically rearranging the rate-cut deck chairs.\"\n\nWhile rate cuts are now seen getting a likely later start and a slower pace this year than investors have anticipated, the Fed's policy rate is seen falling fast next year, with reductions of a full percentage point in both 2025 and 2026.\n\nThe Fed's statement and new Summary of Economic Projections show a central bank wrestling over how to respond to data that many read as pointing to slower inflation - consumer prices in fact did not rise at all in May on a month-over-month basis, according to data released on Wednesday - but also to steady growth and job creation.\n\nHigher neutral rate\n\nThe new projections show the economy is still expected to grow at a slightly above-trend 2.1% this year despite a sluggish first quarter, and the unemployment rate will remain at its current 4% through the year.\n\n\"Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Job gains have remained strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low,\" the Fed said in a statement that was approved unanimously.\n\nFollowing little progress on inflation over the first months of the year, the result was a \"dot plot\" of projected policymaker interest rate forecasts that involved nearly an across-the-board shift higher in the rates considered needed to finish the battle against inflation.\n\nCoupled with recent debate over the possibility that the neutral rate of interest was higher than estimated, the new dot plot suggested Fed officials have concluded higher rates are needed over a longer period of time to keep inflation in check. Summed with a previous increase in the March projection, that neutral rate is now estimated at more than a quarter of a percentage point above where it ended 2023.\n\nThe Fed aggressively raised rates in 2022 and 2023 in response to a surge in inflation that peaked at a 40-year high some two years ago.", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UnionLeader.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_plot_(statistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dot plot (statistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Travel", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/unionleader.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/df/adf26d76-4fbb-5422-9d15-b4be31e2b9aa/6669f2f522727.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 596, "textEnd": 601}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 672, "textEnd": 678}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!\n\nCryptocurrency prices wavered Wednesday as investors parsed commentary from the Federal Reserve that provided new insight into the U.S. central bank's fight against inflation.\n\nPolicymakers' move to leave interest rates unchanged for an 11th consecutive month was a foregone conclusion, based on movements in Fed futures markets. At its most restrictive position in over 20 years, the Fed kept its benchmark borrowing rate at a range between 5.25% and 5.50%.\n\nThis month's release of a so-called \"dot plot,\" however, suggested shot callers at the U.S. central bank have seen a notable shift in financial conditions since March. The Fed in its most recent Summary of Economic Projections had penciled in three rate cuts through years-end.\n\nThe dot plot released Wednesday suggested Fed policymakers now think one rate cut could be more appropriate -- interpreted by the market as a hawkish sign. The projection went beyond the two rate cuts that economists had expected the Fed could telegraph, as it looks to keep rates higher for longer in the face of a strong economy and U.S. labor market.\n\nCryptocurrency prices had risen earlier in the day on news that inflation had slowed to 3.3% in the 12 months through May. The report indicated that consumer prices for American goods and services rose slightly less last month than economists had expected.\n\nFollowing the Fed's announcement, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fell. Just 15 minutes after the Fed's move, for example, Bitcoin's price swiftly fell 1.2% to around $69,000 from $69,900. Meanwhile, the prices of Ethereum and Solana also ticked down at similar rates.\n\nThe Fed has maintained in recent months that it will not cut rates until it has \"gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.\" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell affirmed that stance on Wednesday and said, \"So far this year, the data have not given us that greater confidence.\"\n\n\"Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace,\" Powell added in a statement. \"In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the Committee's 2% inflation objective.\"\n\nBefore the conclusion of the Fed's policy meeting, futures traders penciled in a 61% chance that the Fed cuts rates in September, likely delivering a boost to the U.S. economy through lower borrowing rates. That figure fell to 59% following the release of Powell's written remarks.\n\nNot long before U.S. inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022, the Fed began lifting interest rates from near-zero to cool a red-hot economy. While inflation has come down significantly since then, Powell affirmed Wednesday that the U.S. central bank's quest to 2% isn't over yet.\n\nPowell pointed to Wednesday's Consumer Price Index report, where inflation was flat on a month-to-month basis in May, as a sign of potential progress. \"Let me say that we welcome today's reading and hope for more like that,\" he said.\n\n\"The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals,\" Powell added, of which one is \"maximum employment\" among U.S. workers.\n\nThe price of so-called risk assets, including stocks and crypto, typically face pressure as interest rates rise and the payouts on holding cash and U.S. Treasuries become more attractive. Investors anticipate the opposite would happen as the Fed loosens U.S. monetary conditions.", "source": {"uri": "decrypt.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Decrypt"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andre_beganski@decrypt.co", "name": "Andr\u00e9 Beganski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_plot_(statistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dot plot (statistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-fungible token"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_exchange", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Futures exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goods and services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Full employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Treasury security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/height/512/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/jerome-powell-fed-chair-gID_7.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The move was widely telegraphed.\n\nBecause inflation has proven sticky in the first half of the year, the timing for when the Fed might first cut interest rates has been consistently pushed back since the start of 2024. For a time, the possibility of no interest rate revisions this year looked like it could become a reality.\n\nThe Fed has held interest rates steady since last raising rates in July 2023. The rate target is still the highest it has been since 2006, before the global financial crisis.\n\nThe Fed's goal is for long-run inflation to run at about 2%, a level that it considers healthy for the country's economic growth.\n\nAccording to the most recent reading of the closely watched consumer price index, released Wednesday, inflation fell one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.3% for the year ending in May. That was welcome in that the headline number is falling, but it is still a way off from where the Fed wants it to be.\n\nThus far, the resilient labor market has given the Fed insulation to keep interest rates high.\n\nHigher interest rates are meant to filter through the economy and slow demand for goods and services, with a knock-on effect on labor. If the unemployment rate starts to rise, it would also be harmful to President Joe Biden in an election year.\n\nThe economy added 272,000 jobs in May, and the unemployment rate rose a tenth of a percentage point to 4%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported last Friday.\n\nStill, there are some signs that the labor market is softening.\n\nJob openings fell 5% in April to just under 8.1 million, a decline of about 19% from a year ago, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported earlier this month in an update to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. That marks the least monthly job openings since February 2021, when the labor market was still struggling to bounce back from pandemic-related disturbances.\n\nFor context, monthly job openings peaked in March 2022, the first month the Fed hiked interest rates, at over 12 million, so the most recent numbers mark a 33% decline from that time.\n\nIn another bright spot, GDP growth has also remained positive. The Bureau of Economic Analysis found that GDP expanded at a 1.3% seasonally adjusted annual rate in the first quarter of this year.\n\nWhile economic growth remained positive in the first quarter, the slowdown is a notable drop from the preceding quarter, when GDP grew at a healthy 3.4% clip.\n\nYears of high inflation have made the economy unpalatable to many voters. While inflation is much lower than it was at its peak, the cumulative price hikes have scarred households. For voters, more than three years of compounded inflation is making them feel poorer and negatively coloring their perceptions of the economy -- bad news for Biden.\n\nFor instance, while the prices for food at home -- grocery prices -- have only increased by 1% over the past year, they are up more than 20% since Biden entered office. Clothing prices are up less than 1% since May 2023, but 11% since January 2021. Energy prices have risen 3.7% this past year but have exploded more than 35% during Biden's presidency.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThere are concerns that the Fed may decide to cut interest rates too early if the economy starts slowing. During the Great Inflation of the 1970s, the Fed had to repeatedly raise and cut rates as inflation proved sticky. The worry is that if the central bank cuts too soon, inflation could stage a resurgence, forcing the Fed to hike again -- adding to recession fears.\n\n\"A potential slowdown later on might encourage the Fed to do its own stimulus now by lowering rates and growing its balance sheet,\" Ryan Young, an economist with the Competitive Enterprise Institute. \"Markets will expect inflation to go back up, and factor that into today's prices in a situation where expectations influence outcomes, leading to their own confirmation.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_halaschak@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Zachary Halaschak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007\u20132008_financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2007\u20132008 financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goods and services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_Enterprise_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competitive Enterprise Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Economic_Analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Economic Analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stimulus (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management Relations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/jpoww.jpg.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

In April, the CPI was up from March at a 3.8% annualized rate. That's below the 4.6% rate posted in the first quarter of 2024, but above the 3.4% average for the prior 12 months.\n\nFor the past year, monthly changes in prices have bounced around. Stripping out food and energy, core prices were up 3.6% from March to April - the same as the 12-month average for month-to-month changes.\n\nThe history of struggles with inflation indicates the Fed should not lower interest rates until inflation hits the 2% target for several months. Easing policy too soon would likely reignite inflation and require to Fed to raise rates again.\n\nHousing services account for 36% of the CPI, and policymakers have anticipated that declining increases for apartment rents, recorded by industry surveys, would bring down housing inflation.\n\nHowever, the lion's share of the shelter component is the imputed rent on owner-occupied homes - the estimated rent homeowners could obtain from renting their properties. Since the global financial crisis, the pace of new home construction has slowed. Over the past year, even with higher mortgage rates, resale prices on homes rose 7%. The shelter portion of the CPI is up 5.5% over the last year and will not likely rescue the country from inflation.\n\nServices, other than housing, account for 25% of the CPI and were up 5.1%. These are labor intensive, and prices are considerably sensitive to wages. The labor market may no longer be cherry-red hot but in May, the economy still added a robust 272,000 jobs.\n\nAll along, Fed policy has not been as tight as the task requires.\n\nInflation reached 8.5% in March 2022. The Fed ultimately raised the federal-funds rate - the overnight rate that banks charge each other to borrow reserves - to 5.3%, or about 62% of peak inflation.\n\nWhen former Fed Chair Paul Volcker slugged it out with inflation that peaked at 14.6% in 1980, he pushed the target interest rate all the way to 19.1%.\n\nComplicating matters, President Joe Biden's fiscal policies have an inflationary bias. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the federal deficit will be 5.6% this year and 6.1% in 2025, up from 4.6% just prior to the pandemic. The International Monetary Fund estimates those larger deficits add about half a percentage point to inflation.\n\nBiden's climate-change agenda has similar consequences. The cost of installing a new air conditioner is up thousands of dollars. Overall, complying with new energy-conservation and emissions standards is raising new home prices an estimated $31,000.\n\nThe recent surge of immigration, enabled by Biden rolling back many of former President Donald Trump's policies, allowed employment growth of about 250,000 a month in 2023. The sustainable pace under the prior immigration regime would been about 100,000.\n\nAll those additional workers are looking for apartments. No surprise, for example, that the apartment vacancy rate in New York City is at a historically low 1.4%.\n\nMoreover, the recently approved $95 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, and Biden's program to forgive an additional $475 billion in student debt, will add to the federal deficit.\n\nNow a bipartisan group of U.S. senators is proposing the Pentagon spend an additional $32 billion annually on artificial intelligence to keep pace with Chinese and Russian military capabilities.\n\nAt the end of 2025, most of the personal tax provisions of the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act will expire. Few observers expect these will be permitted to lapse entirely, and extending those without raising other taxes could cost up to $4.8 trillion over 10 years.\n\nIt's safe to assume that the stimulus to aggregate demand and inflation created by bigger deficits will grow. Ordinary folks see this in their lives - groceries are taking the largest share of family incomes in three decades, and low-wage workers struggle with food insecurity.\n\nConsumer expectations for inflation over the coming year, as tracked by the Conference Board, University of Michigan and New York Federal Reserve, average about 4%.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Fed should not be talking about easing monetary policy. Rather, it should recognize that interest rates may yet have to go higher.\n\nPeter Morici is an economist and emeritus business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist.\n\nMore: Fed won't move interest rates this week, but meeting will still be a feast for economists\n\nPlus: Stock market faces midweek double whammy with Fed decision following CPI inflation reading\n\n-Peter Morici\n\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

The White House has been emphasizing any positive inflation data, alongside the country's robust labor market, as it aims to improve the public's estimation of Biden's management of the economy.\n\nIt is also positive for the Fed, which has worked to tamp down inflation for two years now by raising interest rates. The decline further lends credence to the general consensus that the Fed will begin cutting rates sometime this year, although the exact timing is unclear.\n\nStill, inflation has a long way to fall before reaching the Fed's 2% level.\n\nOn a month-to-month basis, inflation was flat.\n\n\"Core inflation,\" which doesn't include volatile food and energy prices, fell to two tenths of a percentage point to 3.4% for the year ending in May. Overall, core inflation has generally trended down over the past 12 months in evidence that the Fed's tightening is starting to pay off.\n\n\"The Fed's recession-level rate hikes are working, and as demand and inflation slow, it is time to reduce interest rates marginally,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS. \"The inflation data are sending the Federal Reserve a message, and it looks like they better keep a couple of interest rate cuts on the table this year because the market sure is.\"\n\nHousing costs pushed the CPI higher last month. Shelter costs rose 0.4% over the month and 5.4% over the year. Shelter prices contributed two-thirds of the annual increase in overall inflation.\n\nThe energy index fell 2% over the month, led by 3.6% decrease in gasoline prices. Energy prices are now up more than 3.7% from this time last year.\n\nAnnual inflation peaked at about 9% in June 2022. Although it has since fallen, it is still running uncomfortably higher than the Fed's 2% target.\n\nInflation has been blamed on various factors on both the supply and demand sides of the equation. Republicans have argued that the explosion of stimulus spending during the pandemic and ultralow interest rates supercharged price growth. Democrats have been pointing to supply-side problems and noted that inflation increased in most Western countries, and not just the U.S.\n\nBiden has become a major target of voters' ire over the higher prices. Biden's economic approval rating are underwater, which is bad news for the president given that he is in a close election year contest with rival former President Donald Trump, who is the expected Republican nominee.\n\nConsumer sentiment has taken a hit as a result of the too-high inflation and the elevated interest rate environment.\n\nIn May, the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index dropped to 69.1 -- that marks a 10.5% drop in sentiment over the past month alone. The last time sentiment was this low was in November 2023.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nInflation -- and higher interest rates -- are overshadowing some positives in the economy.

The report is expected to show a headline inflation rate of 3.4%, matching the annual increase in prices for April, according to expert estimates.\n\nConsumer prices are expected to have risen by 0.1% last month, slowing from a 0.3% increase in April on a monthly basis. This would also be the smallest monthly increase since October 2023.\n\nIf you're looking to understand how inflation data and Federal Reserve decisions impact your investments, InvestingPro offers analytical tools and accurate reports to successfully guide your stock investments amid market volatility.\n\nGet an additional discount on subscription through this link using the code SAPRO2.\n\nAccording to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), falling energy prices are likely to contribute further downward pressure on the headline CPI.\n\nEconomists at Bank of America wrote in a note to clients last week: \"Energy prices likely declined in May on a seasonally adjusted basis due to lower gasoline prices, following increases in April and March. With crude oil prices down, gasoline prices are likely to continue falling in the near term.\"\n\nFor core inflation, which excludes the more volatile costs of food and energy, prices in May are expected to have risen by 3.5% year-over-year, a slight slowdown from the 3.6% annual increase seen in April, according to Investing Saudi data.\n\nCore prices are also expected to have risen by 0.3% month-over-month in May, the same rate as recorded in April.\n\nCore inflation has remained significantly high due to rising costs of shelter and essential services such as insurance and medical care. But Bank of America expects those categories to \"slow down.\"\n\nStephen Juno and Michael Gapen said, \"Shelter inflation is likely to be slightly stronger this month due to higher away-from-home accommodation prices.\" \"However, core services excluding shelter are expected to show some moderation with our expectation for less sharp increases in several service categories.\"\n\nOver time, the economists said they \"expect to see clearer progress in core services inflation,\" thanks to falling car insurance prices, rents, and owners' equivalent rents. Owners' equivalent rent is the hypothetical rent a homeowner would pay for the same property.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) team, led by Jan Hatzius, agreed there would be more inflation slowdown this year, citing \"rebalancing in the auto, rental housing, and labor markets.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) expects annual core CPI inflation of 3.5% and core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation of 2.8% in December 2024.\n\nInflation has remained high above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target. Although this CPI report won't significantly impact the upcoming Fed decision, its timing has perhaps added more attention to its release.\n\nFed officials have described the path to 2% as \"bumpy,\" while recent economic data has fueled the Fed's \"higher rates for longer\" narrative on the rate path.\n\nOn Friday, Labor Department data showed the job market added 272,000 non-farm jobs last month, much higher than the economists' expected 182,000 jobs. Wages also came in higher than estimates at 4.1%, although the unemployment rate rose slightly to 4% from 3.9%.\n\nNotably, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core PCE index, has remained significantly high. The annual change in the core PCE index, closely watched by the Fed, remained steady at 2.8% for April, matching March.\n\nBank of America said, \"If the report matches our expectations, we will maintain our forecast that the Fed will cut rates once this year in December.\"\n\nThe analysts added, \"We see it as unlikely that inflation data will be weak enough in the coming months to enable the Fed to cut rates before December.\"\n\nInvestors now expect a range of one to two 25 basis point rate cuts in 2024, down from six cuts expected at the beginning of the year, according to Bloomberg data.", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Consumer Price Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Spain", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Information_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Information Services", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/USInflationfiguresremainstubbornlyhigh_800x533_L_1710403629.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Investors cheered a soft May inflation report, which could pave the way for Fed easing this year. Rate cuts in September are \"overwhelming likely,\" one economist said.\n\nWall Street is feeling a lot more upbeat on the path of interest rates this year.\n\nInvestors cheered a positive consumer price index report for May on Wednesday. Consumer prices fell below economists' expectations for the second month in a row.\n\nInflation was flat last month and was up 3.3% year-over-year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported, a data point that could put the Federal Reserve back on track to ease its policy later this year after a series of discouraging inflation reports in the first quarter.\n\nThree rate cuts by the end of 2024 are back on the table, with investors seeing a 72% chance the Fed could cut rates three times or more by December, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nSome Wall Street analysts predict the Fed's first cut could come as soon as July, though most see a rate cut in September as the most likely scenario.\n\n\"Wednesday's weaker-than-expected CPI will allow the Fed to start cutting interest rates as soon as September, since we have now seen multiple encouraging inflation readings, after the concerning spike in inflation earlier this year,\" Skyler Weinand, the chief investment officer of Regan Capital, said in a note. \"There's a clear path to a soft landing and the Fed may very well be coming to the market's rescue in as little as three months.\"\n\n\"Today's news would seem to open the door to a July rate cut, although we still think that's very unlikely given hawkish rhetoric from the Fed recently,\" Preston Caldwell, Morningstar's chief US economist said in a statement. \"But rate cuts starting by September should now be cemented as overwhelming likely.\"\n\nHeadline inflation has eased, partly due to cooling gas and food prices. BLS data shows that the gas index slumped 3.6% in May. Meanwhile, the food at home index remained level after dropping 0.2% in April.\n\n\"The Fed is increasingly risking a downturn in the economy by leaving rates too high for too long,\" Ryan Severino, the chief economist for BGO said on Wednesday. \"While our modeling suggests that the Fed could cut later this year, it does not have infinite time on its hands, especially as we see more evidence of slowing in the US economy.\"\n\nInvestors are waiting for Fed Chair Jerome Powell to speak later this afternoon, which should give markets more guidance on the path of rate cuts. But the chief central banker will likely hold off on rate cut signals for now, Weinand said, thanks to hotter-than-expected inflation prints all throughout the first quarter.\n\n\"Things are playing out as the Fed hoped, so Jerome Powell will probably be feeling good this afternoon,\" David Russell, TradeStation's global head of market strategy, said in a note. \"The bears have nowhere to run to and nowhere to hide.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_sor@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Jennifer Sor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_investment_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief investment officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headline_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Headline inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/6669b7ee764df1611258f0eb?format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

But the May consumer price index reading, out Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. New York time, will probably help determine how many reductions get taken out of the central bank's \"dot plot\" displaying the expected rate path.\n\n\"You are going to get inflation data during the meeting, and that is what is going to determine the dots,\" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG LLP. \"The ultimate determinant is going to be the inflation numbers.\"\n\nThe policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee is widely expected to hold its benchmark rate steady for a seventh consecutive meeting as it awaits more evidence that inflation is still moving down toward its 2% target. The rate decision, and the projections, will be released at 2 p.m. in Washington. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference 30 minutes later.\n\nProjections\n\nFOMC participants are \"encouraged to update\" their projections when key data are released during the two-day policy meetings, Powell told reporters in December. Until \"maybe late morning\" on the final day of the meeting, \"it's OK to update,\" and at the December meeting, \"some people did update their forecast\" to incorporate new inflation data, he said.\n\nA 41% plurality of economists expect the median rate projection to signal two cuts in 2024, while 41% expect it to show just one or no cuts at all, according to a Bloomberg survey. Some officials could also mark higher their expectation for appropriate rate levels in the longer term, reflecting the view that restrictive policy has seemed less effective in slowing the economy lately than in past cycles.\n\n\"They do see some upside risks,\" said Derek Tang, an economist with LH Meyer/Monetary Policy Analytics. \"That means easing very carefully, making sure that they're not over-easing and inadvertently boosting the economy.\"\n\nPolicymakers will probably boost their 2024 inflation estimates, reflecting higher-than-expected readings in the first quarter. They could also raise their projections for the unemployment rate after a monthly report published Friday showed it climbed to 4% in May, the highest level in more than two years.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says...\n\n\"The June FOMC meeting will be one of the most pivotal this year as Powell may provide the clearest hint yet as to the rate-cut timetable. The new dot plot likely will indicate two 25-basis-point cuts this year, compared with three in the March version.\"\n\nThe FOMC is almost certain to retain the guidance on rates in its post-meeting policy statement, which says no reductions will be appropriate until it has more confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward its 2% target.\n\nIn May, the FOMC said \"in recent months, there has been a lack of further progress\" on inflation. Retaining that phrase could be read as hawkish after April inflation data, published since the May policy meeting, showed a moderation from the previous three months.\n\nCommittee Changes\n\nSt. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, who began his role in April, will submit quarterly projections at this week's meeting for the first time. It will also be the final meeting for Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, who is stepping down at the end of June when her term expires.\n\nPress Conference\n\nPowell will probably be pressed by reporters on whether he agrees with the median rate projection for 2024, and about whether rate cuts at upcoming meetings in July or September would be under consideration. At the moment, investors are putting almost even odds on a September cut, according to futures, while the implied odds of a cut in July are minimal.\n\nThe Fed chair is also certain to be asked about the consumer price index, though officially the Fed targets a separate price gauge based on personal consumption expenditures, which will be updated at the end of the month. He will also probably be quizzed on recent signs of a moderating labor market and cooling economic growth.\n\n\"People might ask him about the softening momentum and how they think about it,\" said Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research. \"He is likely to say they are monitoring it, and so far the consumer seems to be OK -- maybe some cracks from the low end -- but this is something that they're keeping a close eye on.\"", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_plot_(statistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dot plot (statistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benchmarking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPMG", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KPMG"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loretta_J._Mester", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loretta J.

This would result in an annual increase of 3.4%. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI is projected to rise by 0.3% month-over-month, translating to a 3.5% annual rate. While these figures are not drastically different from April's readings, they still reflect inflation above the Fed's 2% target.\n\nOne of the main contributors to the modest inflation in May is the significant drop in gasoline prices. Average nationwide prices for unleaded gas fell by about 18 cents per gallon to $3.61, according to Gasbuddy data. This decline has alleviated some inflationary pressures, providing consumers with much-needed relief. Economists from Bank of America Securities noted that falling energy prices in May likely contributed to the lower headline CPI.\n\nAlthough the expected tame inflation report for May will not immediately prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, it could pave the way for rate cuts later in the year if the trend continues. The Fed has maintained its key interest rate at a 23-year high to combat inflation, with plans to only consider cuts once inflation shows consistent progress toward their 2% target.\n\nThe Fed pays close attention to core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, as it provides a clearer picture of underlying price trends. The median forecast suggests core inflation will slightly decrease to a 3.5% annual rate in May from 3.6% in April. However, some components, like used car prices, may have seen notable increases.\n\nGiven the current data and trends, the outlook is cautiously bullish. If inflation remains subdued and gasoline prices continue to decline, the Fed may consider easing monetary policy later in the year, potentially boosting stock markets and easing pressure on the US dollar. However, sustained vigilance on core inflation components is crucial for accurate forecasting.", "source": {"uri": "fxempire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FXEmpire.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_hyerczyk@fxempire.com", "name": "James Hyerczyk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_(United_States_coin)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penny (United States coin)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://responsive.fxempire.com/v7/_fxempire_/2024/06/CPI-2024.jpg?func=cover&q=70&width=700", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The decision came hours after new data showed inflation eased slightly last month.\n\nFOMC members' latest median economic projections showed that the federal funds rate would be cut to 5.1 percent at the end of this year, down from their March forecast of 4.6 percent. The projection signaled one cut this year, two fewer than previously expected.\n\n\"Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated. In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the committee's 2 percent inflation objective,\" the Fed said in a press release, noting headway on the inflation front.\n\nPolicymakers have been seeking clear evidence that inflation is on a sustainable path to its inflation target as they are looking at incoming economic data to find the right timing to begin rate cuts.\n\nAhead of the decision, the U.S. Labor Department said in a new report that the consumer price index, a key gauge of inflation, rose 3.3 percent on a yearly basis in May -- a smaller increase than the 3.4 percent rise in April. The latest reading is slightly below economists' forecast of 3.4 percent.\n\nThe U.S. key rate has remained unchanged since a quarter percentage point increase to the current level in July.

But, once again in 2024, we're stuck waiting for that first interest rate cut.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Federal Reserve announced that rates would stay the same. In its statement, the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee said it \"does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.\"\n\nEconomic activity has continued to expand at a \"solid pace,\" according to the Fed statement. \"Job gains have remained strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low.\"\n\nWhile inflation has eased over the past year, according to the Fed, inflation \"remains elevated.\"\n\nJust three months ago, many thought the first rate cut would show up at the Fed's June meeting. But since then, the Fed has continued to express concerns about elevated inflation and the \"lack of further progress\" toward reaching the Fed's 2% inflation goal.\n\nRight now, Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's, said he'd expect the Fed to still cut rates in 2024, possibly a quarter point in September and another quarter point in December. If the Fed skips a rate cut in September, Zandi is expecting a rate cut to be announced Dec. 18 after the Fed's scheduled two-day meeting.\n\nAfter that, he said, the Fed is likely to keep cutting rates gradually until the federal funds rate returns to 3% by the end of 2026. The federal funds rate currently remains within a target range of 5.25% to 5.5% -- which is where short-term rates have been since late July 2023. One has to go back to late January 2001 -- or more than 23 years -- to see the federal funds target as high as 5.5%.\n\nThe interest rates consumers pay skyrocketed\n\nMost people couldn't rattle off the short-term Fed rate. But they're riveted to other rates that hit their wallets.\n\nMany could tell about a nearly 30% or 35% on one of their store-branded credit cards. The average rate for all credit cards is now 20.68%, according to Bankrate.com data. By contrast, the average rate for all credit cards was 16.3% in at the start of 2022, before the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates.\n\nOthers might remember that mortgage rates hit nearly 7.8% in October, now down to an average 6.99% for the 30-year fixed rate mortgage, based on U.S. weekly average data issued June 6 by Freddie Mac.\n\nThe \"vibe\" if you're trying to borrow -- or hoping to refinance your mortgage -- is abysmal.\n\nSure, we have seen some phenomenal high points in recent weeks -- such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing at a record 40,003.59 points on May 17 and General Motors closed at $48.21 a share on June 11, up nearly 31.5% from its close of $36.67 on June 12, 2023.\n\nEven so, many consumers grumble about $10 fast food trips that they swear cost $5 once, scorching interest rates, and their fears that jobs could be lost as technology marches on. We're hearing a ton of unhappy talk about what everybody paid for everything, such as a fun, but not extravagant night, where $50 was spent on burgers and beers.\n\nMichael Greiner, assistant professor of management at the Oakland University School of Business Administration, said many consumers continue to deal with the after shock of skyrocketing inflation in 2022 and a sense of losing economic control after the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020.\n\nThe U.S. unemployment rate hit 14.7% in April 2020 during the start of the pandemic. The economy regained its footing somewhat but the jobless rate was still 6.8% in October 2020.\n\nConsumer prices falling in some areas, especially airfares and used cars\n\nConsumer prices skyrocketed after supply chain disruptions and labor shortages hit during the pandemic. The latest inflationary bout spiked two years ago when consumer prices rose year-over-year by 9.1% in June 2022, according to the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers.\n\nInflation has cooled considerably since then but the Fed is continuing its inflation fight.\n\nThe consumer price index rose by 3.4% over the last 12 months ending in April. And the CPI increased by 3.3% year over year through May, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday.\n\nOn a month-to-month basis, though, inflation was unchanged in May after rising 0.3% in April.\n\nPrices fell slightly month-to-month in several categories in May, including dairy products, non-alcoholic beverages, apparel, and new vehicles.\n\nNew car and truck prices fell 0.5% month-to-month in May, and fell 0.8% year-over-year in May, according to the latest federal inflation data.\n\nUsed car and truck prices fell 9.3% over the 12 months through May, but were up 0.6% month-to-month in May. Used car and truck prices fell 1.4% month-to-month in April.\n\nAirfares were down 5.9% over the 12 months through May and fell 3.6% month-to-month in May.\n\nMany economists and consumers don't see eye to eye\n\nMuch economic angst -- which came to the surface and saw even more light after the pandemic -- remains top of mind for many families, including the high cost of childcare; the great disparity in wealth; the inability to get ahead for many in the middle class, including those with and without college degrees.\n\nOakland University's Greiner said economists can review the current economic data, including the low jobless rate, and say things are doing great in 2024. But that's not how many households feel.\n\n\"Most people aren't looking at the figures the same way economists are,\" Greiner said.\n\nMany consumers, he said, got used to relatively small price hikes for many years and somehow believed that 3% should be considered to be high-inflation, even though 3% inflation has been historically viewed as relatively mild.\n\nSome historical context: Inflation in the United States was at 11% in 1974, 13.5% in 1980, nearly 5.4% in 1990, nearly 3.4% in 2000 and 3.8% in 2008. And inflation was 2.44% in 2018, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Inflation hit 8% in 2022.\n\nWhere was inflation in 2023? Some, wrongly imagine that it was just as bad or worse than when inflation spiked out of control in 2022. But inflation dropped and hit nearly 4.13% in 2023.\n\nUnfortunately, many consumers banked on extraordinarily low inflation for years. Inflation was roughly 2.1% or lower from 2012 through 2020, with the exception of a bump a bit beyond 2.4% in 2018.\n\nMost of us have no idea what we paid for a chicken sandwich at the drive thru or for a dress five years ago, but suddenly it seems like everything costs double or triple what we remember, even if it isn't.\n\nNo doubt, we are paying much more for many goods and services than we did before the pandemic. But, let's also remember that many consumers kept buying many items because we had the extra money from wage gains or savings or stimulus checks sent during the pandemic.\n\n\"When companies were raising prices, people were willing to pay it,\" Greiner said.\n\nNow, many went through that savings. Many are paying more money toward their debt, given the higher interest rates. And retailers and restaurant chains are feeling more pressure to promote price cuts.\n\nTarget, for example, announced in May that it would reduce prices on \"5,000 frequently shopped items.\" The big brand retailer listed price cuts in its press release on \"milk, meat, bread, soda, fresh fruit and vegetables, snacks, yogurt, peanut butter, coffee, diapers, paper towels, pet food and more.\"\n\nThe 16 count package of Huggies Baby Wipes was dropping to 99 cents, instead of $1.19.\n\nIf Target recognizes that consumers are feeling squeezed, you'd hope that the Fed could realize the same, and soon.\n\nThe Fed won't slash interest rates immediately. It's going to feel like the small savings on those baby wipes.\n\nWe're not heading toward a repeat of a 30-year mortgage rate below 3% as we saw in 2021, according to Freddie Mac data. But over time, analysts say consumers could see mortgage rates edge closer to the 5.34% average for a 30-year mortgage in 2022. It might be a welcome sight for many borrowers.\n\n\"The Fed could help with the 'vibecession' if they were to start cutting rates,\" Zandi acknowledged.\n\nConsumers might feel better about their own finances, if the cost of borrowing wasn't so terribly high.\n\nBorrowers would practically immediately start seeing lower interest rates on credit cards and consumer finance loans, as the Fed cut rates over several months. And, Zandi said, auto loan rates and mortgage rates, which are not as directly influenced by the short-term federal funds rate, would likely edge down more as well.\n\nZandi said he expects that 30-year fixed mortgage rates ultimately would settle in between a 5.5% to 6% range once the Fed cuts rates. But he said it could take until early 2026 for the 30-year fixed average to fall below 6%.\n\n\"They will only go lower in a recession,\" Zandi said.\n\n\"The lower rates would be especially helpful for lower income households who are struggling the most financially and who are the most pessimistic,\" Zandi said.\n\nRossman, of Bankrate.com, noted that mortgage rates tend to move in advance of Fed actions because they more closely track 10-year Treasuries, which reflect investor expectations.\n\n\"Our latest economist survey predicted a 10-year Treasury yield of 3.8% next March,\" Rossman said. \"That would probably mean an average 30-year fixed mortgage rate around 6.4%\" next spring. And mortgage rates might fall further toward the high 5% range, closer to 6% than 5%, later in the second half of next year.\n\n\"All of this is written in pencil, of course,\" Rossman added.\n\nIn general, he said, most analysts expect that mortgage rates could be \"higher for longer.\"\n\nMore: Record number of workers can call themselves 401(k) millionaires\n\nMore: Credit card issuers push back on $8 late fee cap with new fees, higher interest rates\n\nWe've not even seen the first rate cut yet.\n\nThe Fed remains hyper-focused on inflation, which is above its 2% target. The Fed is keeping its eye on the core personal consumption expenditure's index, excluding food and energy, that remained at 2.8% in February, March, and April.\n\nThe Fed, Zandi said, wants more evidence that inflation is headed back to target in the coming months. That should happen by September, he said. Inflation continues to slowly, but steadily moderate, he said.\n\n\"The job market and economy are strong, as evidenced by the strong job growth,\" Zandi said. \"But it is cooling off, as unemployment has notched higher -- hiring and quit rates are down.\"\n\n\"The household employment numbers are soft because they are not picking up the surge in immigration, which adding significantly to population, labor force and employment,\" Zandi said.\n\nIt's great to be working, of course, and be able to get a raise. Even so, consumers want to see more retailers and restaurants get a reality check. Launching a limited $5 value meal during the summer, as some fast food chains are doing, is OK. But shoppers want substantive savings.\n\nThe Fed might be fighting inflation, but many consumers are arguing at home over which bills they can afford to pay this month -- and what they can't afford to buy.\n\nThe Fed can get rid of some bad vibes by beginning to roll back interest rates in 2024 now that inflation isn't anywhere close to 8% or 9%.", "source": {"uri": "freep.com", "dataType":

The White House has been emphasizing any positive inflation data alongside the country's robust labor market as it aims to improve the public's perception of Biden's management of the economy.\n\nIt is also positive for the Fed, which has worked to tamp down inflation for two years by raising interest rates. The decline further lends credence to the general consensus that the Fed will begin cutting rates sometime this year, although the exact timing is unclear.\n\nStill, inflation has a long way to go before reaching the Fed's 2% level.\n\nOn a month-to-month basis, inflation was flat.\n\n\"Core inflation,\" which doesn't include volatile food and energy prices, fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 3.4% for the year ending in May. Overall, core inflation has generally trended down over the past 12 months, in evidence that the Fed's tightening is starting to pay off.\n\n\"The Fed's recession-level rate hikes are working, and as demand and inflation slow, it is time to reduce interest rates marginally,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS. \"The inflation data are sending the Federal Reserve a message, and it looks like they better keep a couple of interest rate cuts on the table this year because the market sure is.\"\n\nHousing costs pushed the CPI higher last month. Shelter costs rose 0.4% over the month and 5.4% over the year. Shelter prices contributed two-thirds of the annual increase in overall inflation.\n\nThe energy index fell 2% over the month, led by a 3.6% decrease in gasoline prices. Energy prices are now up more than 3.7% from this time last year.\n\nGrocery prices were flat in May, but the price of food at home is up about 1% from a year ago. Still, compared to just a few years ago, when Biden was sworn into office, grocery prices have jolted by more than 20% -- causing pain for consumers.\n\nCar prices have also come down from peaks notched during the pandemic. New vehicle prices are down nearly 1% from a year ago, and used car prices have fallen 9.3% over the past 12 months.\n\nAnnual inflation peaked at about 9% in June 2022. Although it has since fallen, it is still running uncomfortably higher than the Fed's 2% target.\n\nInflation has been blamed on various factors on both the supply and demand sides of the equation. Republicans have argued the explosion of stimulus spending during the pandemic and ultralow interest rates supercharged price growth. Democrats have been pointing to supply-side problems and noted that inflation increased in most Western countries, not just in the United States.\n\nBiden has become a major target of voters' ire over the higher prices. Biden's economic approval ratings are underwater, which is bad news for the president, given he is in a close election-year contest with former President Donald Trump, the expected Republican nominee.\n\nConsumer sentiment has taken a hit as a result of the too-high inflation and the elevated interest rate environment.\n\nIn May, the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index dropped to 69.1 -- that marks a 10.5% drop in sentiment over the past month alone. The last time sentiment was this low was November 2023.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nInflation and higher interest rates are overshadowing some positives in the economy.

alter Fed plans to hold rates steady", "body": "US Fed chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference in Washington after the rate decision is announced\n\nFresh US consumer inflation data published Wednesday is unlikely to sway the Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to leave its key lending rate unchanged and lower the number of cuts it has penciled in for this year.\n\nThe May headline consumer inflation rate is expected to be little changed from a month earlier, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIf the analysts are correct, inflation will remain stuck firmly above the Fed's long-term target of two percent, giving the US central bank an additional incentive to hold rates at a 23-year high of between 5.25 and 5.50 percent, and wait for the economic winds to change.\n\n\"We expect guidance from the Fed to signal a prolonged pause as the bar for hikes or several cuts remains high,\" Bank of America economists wrote in a recent investor note.\n\n- Pushing back the cuts -\n\nThe Fed is likely to hold its benchmark lending rate at a 23-year high\n\nThe US Fed has a dual mandate from Congress to tackle both inflation and unemployment, and the data suggests it remains broadly on track to tackle both without pushing the US into recession -- despite the small uptick in headline inflation in the first few months of this year.\n\nWith cuts almost certainly off the agenda for this meeting, Wednesday's action is likely to center around the economic forecasts from the 19 members of the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which will be updated for the first time since March.\n\nAnalysts are looking to FOMC members to lower their individual forecasts for where rates will be at the end of the year in a chart known as the \"dot plot,\" which reduces the median number of projected cuts this year from three down to two or fewer.\n\n\"We continue to expect the first rate cut in September,\" Goldman Sachs chief economist David Mericle wrote in a note to clients published on Sunday.\n\nHis team at Goldman sees the Fed moving to ease monetary policy every quarter after that, meaning a total of two 0.25-percentage-point cuts in 2024, and four in 2025.\n\n\"It only takes one dot moving higher to shift the median up to two 25bp (basis point) cuts -- which is our base case,\" economists at Citi wrote in a recent investor note.\n\n\"We'd be surprised to see the Fed drop two easings, but it's possible,\" economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday, while also predicting the FOMC will forecast a median of two cuts this year.\n\nOther analysts, including economists at EY and Barclays, expect the updated forecasts to show a median figure of just one rate cut for 2024.\n\n\"We anticipate the dot plot of median rate expectations will feature only one 25 basis points (bps) rate cut in 2024,\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco wrote in a note to clients.\n\n- Significant shift -\n\nBack in March, FOMC members penciled in a median of 0.75 percentage-points of rate cuts this year\n\nIf the forecasts were to show just one cut this year, it would mark a significant shift from December, when inflation appeared to be firmly on the path towards two percent, and the financial markets were preparing for as many as six rate cuts this year.\n\nBy contrast, futures traders currently assign a probability of just over 50 percent that the Fed will make its first rate cut by September, although they see November as much more likely, according to data from CME Group.\n\nShortly after the interest rate decision is announced, Fed chair Jerome Powell will take questions from reporters during a press conference in Washington.\n\nPowell has insisted in past public comments that the FOMC will remain \"data-dependent\" in its decision-making, and will not be swayed by politics.\n\nNevertheless, a September start to rate cuts would almost certainly thrust the Fed into the middle of a fractious presidential campaign between President Joe Biden and his Republican opponent, Donald Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the US central bank's independence.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But, once again in 2024, we're stuck waiting for that first interest rate cut.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Federal Reserve announced that rates would stay the same. In its statement, the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee said it \"does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.\"\n\nEconomic activity has continued to expand at a \"solid pace,\" according to the Fed statement. \"Job gains have remained strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low.\"\n\nWhile inflation has eased over the past year, according to the Fed, inflation \"remains elevated.\"\n\nJust three months ago, many thought the first rate cut would show up at the Fed's June meeting. But since then, the Fed has continued to express concerns about elevated inflation and the \"lack of further progress\" toward reaching the Fed's 2% inflation goal.\n\nRight now, Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's, said he'd expect the Fed to still cut rates in 2024, possibly a quarter point in September and another quarter point in December. If the Fed skips a rate cut in September, Zandi is expecting a rate cut to be announced Dec. 18 after the Fed's scheduled two-day meeting.\n\nAfter that, he said, the Fed is likely to keep cutting rates gradually until the federal funds rate returns to 3% by the end of 2026. The federal funds rate currently remains within a target range of 5.25% to 5.5% -- which is where short-term rates have been since late July 2023. One has to go back to late January 2001 -- or more than 23 years -- to see the federal funds target as high as 5.5%.\n\nMost people couldn't rattle off the short-term Fed rate. But they're riveted to other rates that hit their wallets.\n\nMany could tell about a nearly 30% or 35% on one of their store-branded credit cards. The average rate for all credit cards is now 20.68%, according to Bankrate.com data. By contrast, the average rate for all credit cards was 16.3% in at the start of 2022, before the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates.\n\nOthers might remember that mortgage rates hit nearly 7.8% in October, now down to an average 6.99% for the 30-year fixed rate mortgage, based on U.S. weekly average data issued June 6 by Freddie Mac.\n\nThe \"vibe\" if you're trying to borrow -- or hoping to refinance your mortgage -- is abysmal.\n\nSure, we have seen some phenomenal high points in recent weeks -- such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing at a record 40,003.59 points on May 17 and General Motors closed at $48.21 a share on June 11, up nearly 31.5% from its close of $36.67 on June 12, 2023.\n\nEven so, many consumers grumble about $10 fast food trips that they swear cost $5 once, scorching interest rates, and their fears that jobs could be lost as technology marches on. We're hearing a ton of unhappy talk about what everybody paid for everything, such as a fun, but not extravagant night, where $50 was spent on burgers and beers.\n\nMichael Greiner, assistant professor of management at the Oakland University School of Business Administration, said many consumers continue to deal with the after shock of skyrocketing inflation in 2022 and a sense of losing economic control after the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020.\n\nThe U.S. unemployment rate hit 14.7% in April 2020 during the start of the pandemic. The economy regained its footing somewhat but the jobless rate was still 6.8% in October 2020.\n\nConsumer prices skyrocketed after supply chain disruptions and labor shortages hit during the pandemic. The latest inflationary bout spiked two years ago when consumer prices rose year-over-year by 9.1% in June 2022, according to the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers.\n\nInflation has cooled considerably since then but the Fed is continuing its inflation fight.\n\nThe consumer price index rose by 3.4% over the last 12 months ending in April. And the CPI increased by 3.3% year over year through May, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday.\n\nOn a month-to-month basis, though, inflation was unchanged in May after rising 0.3% in April.\n\nPrices fell slightly month-to-month in several categories in May, including dairy products, non-alcoholic beverages, apparel, and new vehicles.\n\nNew car and truck prices fell 0.5% month-to-month in May, and fell 0.8% year-over-year in May, according to the latest federal inflation data.\n\nUsed car and truck prices fell 9.3% over the 12 months through May, but were up 0.6% month-to-month in May. Used car and truck prices fell 1.4% month-to-month in April.\n\nAirfares were down 5.9% over the 12 months through May and fell 3.6% month-to-month in May.\n\nMuch economic angst -- which came to the surface and saw even more light after the pandemic -- remains top of mind for many families, including the high cost of childcare; the great disparity in wealth; the inability to get ahead for many in the middle class, including those with and without college degrees.\n\nOakland University's Greiner said economists can review the current economic data, including the low jobless rate, and say things are doing great in 2024. But that's not how many households feel.\n\n\"Most people aren't looking at the figures the same way economists are,\" Greiner said.\n\nMany consumers, he said, got used to relatively small price hikes for many years and somehow believed that 3% should be considered to be high-inflation, even though 3% inflation has been historically viewed as relatively mild.\n\nSome historical context: Inflation in the United States was at 11% in 1974, 13.5% in 1980, nearly 5.4% in 1990, nearly 3.4% in 2000 and 3.8% in 2008. And inflation was 2.44% in 2018, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Inflation hit 8% in 2022.\n\nWhere was inflation in 2023? Some, wrongly imagine that it was just as bad or worse than when inflation spiked out of control in 2022. But inflation dropped and hit nearly 4.13% in 2023.\n\nUnfortunately, many consumers banked on extraordinarily low inflation for years. Inflation was roughly 2.1% or lower from 2012 through 2020, with the exception of a bump a bit beyond 2.4% in 2018.\n\nMost of us have no idea what we paid for a chicken sandwich at the drive thru or for a dress five years ago, but suddenly it seems like everything costs double or triple what we remember, even if it isn't.\n\nNo doubt, we are paying much more for many goods and services than we did before the pandemic. But, let's also remember that many consumers kept buying many items because we had the extra money from wage gains or savings or stimulus checks sent during the pandemic.\n\n\"When companies were raising prices, people were willing to pay it,\" Greiner said.\n\nNow, many went through that savings. Many are paying more money toward their debt, given the higher interest rates. And retailers and restaurant chains are feeling more pressure to promote price cuts.\n\nTarget, for example, announced in May that it would reduce prices on \"5,000 frequently shopped items.\" The big brand retailer listed price cuts in its press release on \"milk, meat, bread, soda, fresh fruit and vegetables, snacks, yogurt, peanut butter, coffee, diapers, paper towels, pet food and more.\"\n\nThe 16 count package of Huggies Baby Wipes was dropping to 99 cents, instead of $1.19.\n\nIf Target recognizes that consumers are feeling squeezed, you'd hope that the Fed could realize the same, and soon.\n\nThe Fed won't slash interest rates immediately. It's going to feel like the small savings on those baby wipes.\n\nWe're not heading toward a repeat of a 30-year mortgage rate below 3% as we saw in 2021, according to Freddie Mac data. But over time, analysts say consumers could see mortgage rates edge closer to the 5.34% average for a 30-year mortgage in 2022. It might be a welcome sight for many borrowers.\n\n\"The Fed could help with the 'vibecession' if they were to start cutting rates,\" Zandi acknowledged.\n\nConsumers might feel better about their own finances, if the cost of borrowing wasn't so terribly high.\n\nBorrowers would practically immediately start seeing lower interest rates on credit cards and consumer finance loans, as the Fed cut rates over several months. And, Zandi said, auto loan rates and mortgage rates, which are not as directly influenced by the short-term federal funds rate, would likely edge down more as well.\n\nZandi said he expects that 30-year fixed mortgage rates ultimately would settle in between a 5.5% to 6% range once the Fed cuts rates. But he said it could take until early 2026 for the 30-year fixed average to fall below 6%.\n\n\"They will only go lower in a recession,\" Zandi said.\n\n\"The lower rates would be especially helpful for lower income households who are struggling the most financially and who are the most pessimistic,\" Zandi said.\n\nRossman, of Bankrate.com, noted that mortgage rates tend to move in advance of Fed actions because they more closely track 10-year Treasuries, which reflect investor expectations.\n\n\"Our latest economist survey predicted a 10-year Treasury yield of 3.8% next March,\" Rossman said. \"That would probably mean an average 30-year fixed mortgage rate around 6.4%\" next spring. And mortgage rates might fall further toward the high 5% range, closer to 6% than 5%, later in the second half of next year.\n\n\"All of this is written in pencil, of course,\" Rossman added.\n\nIn general, he said, most analysts expect that mortgage rates could be \"higher for longer.\"\n\nMore: Record number of workers can call themselves 401(k) millionaires\n\nMore: Credit card issuers push back on $8 late fee cap with new fees, higher interest rates\n\nWe've not even seen the first rate cut yet.\n\nThe Fed remains hyper-focused on inflation, which is above its 2% target. The Fed is keeping its eye on the core personal consumption expenditure's index, excluding food and energy, that remained at 2.8% in February, March, and April.\n\nThe Fed, Zandi said, wants more evidence that inflation is headed back to target in the coming months. That should happen by September, he said. Inflation continues to slowly, but steadily moderate, he said.\n\n\"The job market and economy are strong, as evidenced by the strong job growth,\" Zandi said. \"But it is cooling off, as unemployment has notched higher -- hiring and quit rates are down.\"\n\n\"The household employment numbers are soft because they are not picking up the surge in immigration, which adding significantly to population, labor force and employment,\" Zandi said.\n\nIt's great to be working, of course, and be able to get a raise. Even so, consumers want to see more retailers and restaurants get a reality check. Launching a limited $5 value meal during the summer, as some fast food chains are doing, is OK. But shoppers want substantive savings.\n\nThe Fed might be fighting inflation, but many consumers are arguing at home over which bills they can afford to pay this month -- and what they can't afford to buy.\n\nThe Fed can get rid of some bad vibes by beginning to roll back interest rates in 2024 now that inflation isn't anywhere close to 8% or 9%.\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

Though Fed officials say they expect inflation in those areas to eventually cool, they've signaled that they're prepared to wait as long as it takes.\n\nYet the policymakers' willingness to keep their key rate at a two-decade peak -- thereby keeping costs painfully high for mortgages, auto loans and other forms of consumer borrowing -- carries its own risks.\n\nThe Fed's mandate is to strike a balance between keeping rates high enough to control inflation yet not so high as to damage the job market. While most measures show that growth and hiring remain healthy, some gauges of the economy have begun to reveal signs of weakness. The longer the Fed keeps its benchmark rate elevated, the greater the risk of causing a downturn.\n\nAt the same time, with polls showing that costlier rents, groceries and gasoline are angering voters as the presidential campaign intensifies, Donald Trump has sought to pin the blame for higher prices squarely on President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Fed, led by Chair Jerome Powell, raised its benchmark rate by 5 percentage points from March 2022 through June 2023 -- the fastest such increase in four decades -- to try to drive inflation back down to its 2% target. According to the Fed's preferred measure, inflation has tumbled from 7.1% in June 2022 to 2.7% in March.\n\nThat same gauge showed, though, that prices accelerated in the first three months of 2024, disrupting last year's steady slowdown. On Friday, economists expect the government to report that this measure rose 2.7% in April from a year earlier.\n\nA separate inflation indicator that the government reported this month suggested that prices cooled slightly in April. But with inflation remaining stubbornly above the Fed's target level, Wall Street traders now expect just one rate cut this year, in November. And even that is hardly a slam-dunk, with investors placing the likelihood of a cut in November at 63%, down from 77% a week ago.\n\nLast week, economists at Goldman Sachs became the latest analysts to give up on a rate cut in July, pushing back their forecast for the first of two cuts they expect this year to September. Oxford Economics made a similar call last month. Bank of America foresees just one Fed rate cut this year, in December. Just months ago, many economists had forecast the first rate cut for March of this year.\n\n\"We will need to accumulate further data over the coming months to have a clearer picture of the inflation outlook,\" Loretta Mester, president of Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said this month. \"I now believe that it will take longer to reach our 2% goal than I previously thought.\" (Mester is among 12 officials who are voting on the Fed's rate policy this year.)\n\nAs further data accumulates, so do some signs that the economy is cooling a bit. More Americans, particularly younger adults, are falling behind on their credit card bills, for example, with the share of card debt 90 days or more overdue reaching 10.7% in the first quarter, according to the Fed's New York branch. That's the highest proportion in 14 years.\n\nHiring is also slowing, with businesses posting fewer open jobs, though job advertisements remain high.\n\nAnd more companies, including Target, McDonalds and Burger King, are highlighting price cuts or cheaper deals to try to attract financially squeezed consumers. Their actions could help lower inflation in the coming months. But they also underscore the struggles that lower-income Americans face.\n\n\"There's a lot of signs that consumers are kind of losing some steam and hiring demand is cooling,\" said Julia Coronado, a former Fed economist who is president of MacroPolicy Perspectives. \"You could see more of a slowdown.\"\n\nBut Coronado and other economists also regard the latest trends as a sign that the economy may simply be normalizing after a period of rapid growth. Companies are still hiring, though at a more modest pace than at the start of the year. And data suggests that Americans traveled in record numbers over the Memorial Day weekend, a sign they're confident in their finances.\n\nThe Fed's reluctance to cut rates is likely to set it apart from some of its counterparts overseas in the coming months. Central bankers in Europe and the United Kingdom are expected to reduce borrowing costs as soon as next month, largely because inflation has fallen further in those areas than in the United States. Rising prices in Europe and the U.K. were driven mostly by spiking energy costs stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and those costs have largely receded.\n\nThe U.K. and European economies have also fared much worse than the U.S. economy since the pandemic, so inflation has not been as serious a threat. The economies of the U.K. and the 20 countries that use the euro currency actually shrank in the second half of last year before recording mild growth in the first three months of 2024. The U.K. economy has barely grown in the past 12 months.\n\nIn the U.S., a big reason why inflation remains above the Fed's target is that distortions stemming from the pandemic are still keeping prices elevated in several areas even as much of the rest of the economy has moved past the pandemic.\n\nHousing costs, led by apartment rents, jumped two years ago after many Americans sought additional living space during the pandemic. Rental costs are now slowing: They rose 5.4% in April on an annual basis, down from 8.8% a year earlier. But they're still rising faster than before the pandemic.\n\nWE'RE HERE TO HELP\n\nDo you have a concern in your community or a news tip? We want to hear from you!\n\nEmail us: share@abc15.com\n\nFollow us: Facebook | Instagram | YouTube\n\nLast month, rent and homeownership, along with hotel prices, accounted for two-thirds of the annual rise in \"core\" inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs. Powell and other Fed officials have acknowledged that they had expected rents to fall more quickly than they have.\n\nThe cost of a new lease, though, has tumbled since mid-2022. A gauge of newly leased apartment rents calculated by the government shows that they rose just 0.4% in the first three months of 2024 compared with a year earlier. Yet it takes time for newer, lower-priced rents to feed into the government's inflation measure.\n\n\"Market rents adjust more quickly to economic conditions than what landlords charge their existing tenants,\" Philip Jefferson, the Fed's vice chair and a top lieutenant to Powell, said last week. \"This lag suggests that the large increase in market rents during the pandemic is still being passed through to existing rents and may keep housing services inflation elevated for a while longer.\"\n\nThe cost of auto insurance has soared nearly 23% from a year earlier, a huge jump that reflects the surge in prices of new and used cars during the pandemic. Insurance companies now must pay more to replace totaled cars and as a result are charging their customers more.\n\nSurging auto insurance rates squeeze drivers, fuel inflation AP via Scripps News 6:53 PM, Apr 24, 2024\n\n\"This is about stuff that happened in 2021,\" said Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and a former Fed economist. \"You cannot go back and change that.\"\n\nWatch ABC15 live:\n\nIndoor golf simulator club and lounge opens in Chandler\n\nBrandon Brown, Phoenix Business Journal\n\n8:40 AM, Jun 11, 2024\n\nFrameTec gets approval for new $150M Casa Grande manufacturing plant\n\nRon Davis, Phoenix Business Journal\n\n8:38 AM, Jun 11, 2024\n\nDNC to pay for some of first lady's travel to Hunter Biden trial\n\nScripps News Staff\n\n7:39 AM, Jun 11, 2024\n\nViolent crime was down 15% in first quarter compared to 2023\n\nElina Tarkazikis\n\n7:20 AM, Jun 11, 2024", "source": {"uri": "abc15.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "abc15 Arizona"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@abc15.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vehicle insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronado,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronado, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Coronado, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Cleveland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loretta_J._Mester", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loretta J.

The policymakers have held interest rates at 5.3% since July last year, after raising them sharply from near zero starting in March 2022.\n\n\"We expect the Federal Reserve to keep its key interest rate unchanged at 5.25% to 5.5% at the end of the two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, with any change in monetary policy outcome still being driven by incoming economic data,\" said Manish Chowdhury, Head of Research at StoxBox.\n\nAfter a steady decline of inflation in the second half of last year, the markets anticipated three to four rate cuts this year, with the first of them coming as early as March. However, the central bank dialled down on its stance and stuck to tighter monetary policy, after a surprise uptick in inflation in the first three months of 2024.\n\nLast month, Fed chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its target before it would reduce its benchmark rate. Powell noted that it would likely take more time to gain that confidence than Fed officials had previously thought.\n\nWith the cuts almost certainly off the agenda for the latest meeting, the anticipation will also be around a set of economic forecasts that the rate-setting panel will release for the first time since March.\n\nFed commentary\n\nWith the inflation trajectory still not striking a chord with the Fed officials and labour market not showing signs of sustained weakness, it is believed that the tone of the Fed Chairman is unlikely to change by not giving any clear signal on rate cuts.\n\nAnalysts expect the policymakers to signal, if any, that they will cut their benchmark rate just once or twice by year end, rather than the three times they had envisioned in March.\n\n\"Surprising weakness in the next jobs report and May's robust payroll print doesn't suggest inflation data alone won't be enough to spur the Fed to cut rates in July,\" said Amit Goel, Co-Founder & Chief Global Strategist, Pace 360.\n\n\"Given the political sensitivity around November's presidential election, we think the most plausible start date is December. In the dot plot, we expect the median participant to reduce the scope of cuts expected this year from 75 bps to 50 bps,\" Goel added.\n\nThe direction for D-Street\n\nWith the election outcome out of the way, Indian markets are trading near all-time highs, and are looking for fresh triggers for a directional move on either side. The tone of the Fed chair Powell and any indication on the rate cuts trajectory this year will have an impact on Indian equities.\n\n\"The 32% decline in India VIX during the last 5 days indicates that the days of heightened volatility are over and the market has entered a consolidation phase. From now on the focus will be on fundamentals and news flows,\" said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services.\n\n\"The Fed may delay or at best pause the rate cut trajectory. That said, post-election stability in ministry allocation only means status quo of policy stability, which is great for markets in general,\" said Abhishek Banerjee, smallcase Manager and Founder at Lotusdew.\n\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Such a reading would extend a bout of stubborn inflation that stretches back to last year.\n\nPrice increases have slowed significantly from a peak of about 9%, but inflation still stands more than a percentage point higher than the Federal Reserve's target rate of 2%.\n\nFor nearly a year, the Fed has held interest rates steady at their highest level since 2001, hoping that elevated borrowing costs would slow economic activity, reduce consumer demand and lower prices.\n\nInstead, the economy has hummed and price increases have stalled.\n\nA jobs report released on Friday blew past economist expectations, demonstrating the resilient strength of the economy. Blockbuster hiring in May exceeded the average number of jobs added each month over the previous year, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said.\n\nAverage hourly wages surged 4.1% over the year ending in May, the report found. That rate of pay increase exceeds the pace of inflation, indicating that the spending power of workers has grown even as prices jump.\n\nThe data marks a boon for workers but could give pause to policymakers, since they fear that a rise in pay could prompt businesses to raise prices in order to cover the added labor cost.\n\nEconomic output slowed markedly at the outset of 2024, though it continued to grow at a solid pace.\n\nThe Fed, in turn, has all but abandoned a previous forecast of three interest rate cuts by the end of the year.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making body on interest rates, said last month that it does not anticipate cutting interest rates until it retains confidence that inflation is moving sustainably downward.\n\n\"So far the data has not given us that greater confidence,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference in Washington, D.C., last month. \"It is likely that gaining such greater confidence will take longer than previously expected.\"\n\nEconomists expect the Fed to hold interest rates steady for the seventh consecutive time at the close of its meeting on Wednesday.\n\nThe Fed risks a rebound of inflation if it cuts interest rates too quickly, since stronger consumer demand on top of solid economic activity could lead to an acceleration of price increases.\n\nA prolonged period of high interest rates, however, risks placing downward pressure on economic growth and plunging the U.S. into a recession.\n\nPrice increases have drawn attention from voters as the U.S. hurtles toward what appears to be a closely contested presidential election in the fall.\n\nEighty-five percent of U.S. adults surveyed by ABC News/Ipsos last month said inflation is an important issue, making it the second-highest priority among adults surveyed. The top priority, the economy, also relates to individuals' perceptions of price increases.\n\nOn each of those issues, the economy and inflation, those surveyed by ABC News/Ipsos said they trusted former President Donald Trump over President Joe Biden by a margin of 14 percentage points.\n\n\"Inflation is something that affects absolutely everybody,\" Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in the Governance Studies program at the Brookings Institution, previously told ABC News. \"People notice it, whether they're rich or poor.\"", "source": {"uri": "weisradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WEIS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ipsos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookings_Institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brookings Institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://weisradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GETTYRF_81022_MoneyInflation252028829.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

But the May consumer price index reading, out Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. New York time, will probably help determine how many reductions get taken out of the central bank's \"dot plot\" displaying the expected rate path.\n\n\"You are going to get inflation data during the meeting, and that is what is going to determine the dots,\" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG LLP. \"The ultimate determinant is going to be the inflation numbers.\"\n\nThe policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee is widely expected to hold its benchmark rate steady for a seventh consecutive meeting as it awaits more evidence that inflation is still moving down toward its 2% target. The rate decision, and the projections, will be released at 2 p.m. in Washington. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference 30 minutes later.\n\nProjections\n\nFOMC participants are \"encouraged to update\" their projections when key data are released during the two-day policy meetings, Powell told reporters in December. Until \"maybe late morning\" on the final day of the meeting, \"it's OK to update,\" and at the December meeting, \"some people did update their forecast\" to incorporate new inflation data, he said.\n\nA 41% plurality of economists expect the median rate projection to signal two cuts in 2024, while 41% expect it to show just one or no cuts at all, according to a Bloomberg survey. Some officials could also mark higher their expectation for appropriate rate levels in the longer term, reflecting the view that restrictive policy has seemed less effective in slowing the economy lately than in past cycles.\n\n\"They do see some upside risks,\" said Derek Tang, an economist with LH Meyer/Monetary Policy Analytics. \"That means easing very carefully, making sure that they're not over-easing and inadvertently boosting the economy.\"\n\nPolicymakers will probably boost their 2024 inflation estimates, reflecting higher-than-expected readings in the first quarter. They could also raise their projections for the unemployment rate after a monthly report published Friday showed it climbed to 4% in May, the highest level in more than two years.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says...\n\n\"The June FOMC meeting will be one of the most pivotal this year as Powell may provide the clearest hint yet as to the rate-cut timetable. The new dot plot likely will indicate two 25-basis-point cuts this year, compared with three in the March version.\"\n\nThe FOMC is almost certain to retain the guidance on rates in its post-meeting policy statement, which says no reductions will be appropriate until it has more confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward its 2% target.\n\nIn May, the FOMC said \"in recent months, there has been a lack of further progress\" on inflation. Retaining that phrase could be read as hawkish after April inflation data, published since the May policy meeting, showed a moderation from the previous three months.\n\nCommittee Changes\n\nSt. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, who began his role in April, will submit quarterly projections at this week's meeting for the first time. It will also be the final meeting for Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, who is stepping down at the end of June when her term expires.\n\nPress Conference\n\nPowell will probably be pressed by reporters on whether he agrees with the median rate projection for 2024, and about whether rate cuts at upcoming meetings in July or September would be under consideration. At the moment, investors are putting almost even odds on a September cut, according to futures, while the implied odds of a cut in July are minimal.\n\nThe Fed chair is also certain to be asked about the consumer price index, though officially the Fed targets a separate price gauge based on personal consumption expenditures, which will be updated at the end of the month. He will also probably be quizzed on recent signs of a moderating labor market and cooling economic growth.\n\n\"People might ask him about the softening momentum and how they think about it,\" said Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research. \"He is likely to say they are monitoring it, and so far the consumer seems to be OK -- maybe some cracks from the low end -- but this is something that they're keeping a close eye on.\"\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

This decision reflects the Fed's ongoing efforts to manage inflation without stalling economic growth.\n\nU.S. Fed Meeting Announcements: Key Outcomes and Statements\n\nDuring the Federal Reserve's latest meeting in Washington, D.C., chaired by Jerome Powell, it was declared that the key interest rate would remain at approximately 5.25% to 5.5%. This rate has been maintained to help temper consumer demand and manage inflation, which, while decreasing, remains above the Fed's long-term target of 2%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve expressed that economic activity continues to grow at a strong pace, with ongoing job gains and a low unemployment rate. However, the central bank emphasized the need for further evidence of sustained inflation reduction before considering rate cuts.\n\nJerome Powell and other Fed officials have indicated a careful approach, focusing on long-term economic stability rather than immediate rate reductions.\n\nEconomic Indicators and Analyst Perspectives\n\nThe recent Bureau of Labor Statistics report highlighted that the annual inflation rate dropped to 3.3% in May, marking a decline from previous months and a sign of potential stabilization in the economy. Despite these encouraging figures, Fed officials are seeking more consistent data before adjusting monetary policies.\n\nEconomists like Joe Brusuelas from RSM and James Knightley from ING have suggested that if the trend of easing inflation continues, there could be scope for a rate cut as early as September.

alter Fed plans to hold rates steady", "body": "Washington (AFP) - Fresh US consumer inflation data published Wednesday is unlikely to sway the Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to leave its key lending rate unchanged and lower the number of cuts it has penciled in for this year.\n\nThe May headline consumer inflation rate is expected to be little changed from a month earlier, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIf the analysts are correct, inflation will remain stuck firmly above the Fed's long-term target of two percent, giving the US central bank an additional incentive to hold rates at a 23-year high of between 5.25 and 5.50 percent, and wait for the economic winds to change.\n\n\"We expect guidance from the Fed to signal a prolonged pause as the bar for hikes or several cuts remains high,\" Bank of America economists wrote in a recent investor note.\n\nPushing back the cuts\n\nThe US Fed has a dual mandate from Congress to tackle both inflation and unemployment, and the data suggests it remains broadly on track to tackle both without pushing the US into recession -- despite the small uptick in headline inflation in the first few months of this year.\n\nWith cuts almost certainly off the agenda for this meeting, Wednesday's action is likely to center around the economic forecasts from the 19 members of the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which will be updated for the first time since March.\n\nAnalysts are looking to FOMC members to lower their individual forecasts for where rates will be at the end of the year in a chart known as the \"dot plot,\" which reduces the median number of projected cuts this year from three down to two or fewer.\n\n\"We continue to expect the first rate cut in September,\" Goldman Sachs chief economist David Mericle wrote in a note to clients published on Sunday.\n\nHis team at Goldman sees the Fed moving to ease monetary policy every quarter after that, meaning a total of two 0.25-percentage-point cuts in 2024, and four in 2025.\n\n\"It only takes one dot moving higher to shift the median up to two 25bp (basis point) cuts -- which is our base case,\" economists at Citi wrote in a recent investor note.\n\n\"We'd be surprised to see the Fed drop two easings, but it's possible,\" economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday, while also predicting the FOMC will forecast a median of two cuts this year.\n\nOther analysts, including economists at EY and Barclays, expect the updated forecasts to show a median figure of just one rate cut for 2024.\n\n\"We anticipate the dot plot of median rate expectations will feature only one 25 basis points (bps) rate cut in 2024,\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco wrote in a note to clients.\n\nSignificant shift\n\nIf the forecasts were to show just one cut this year, it would mark a significant shift from December, when inflation appeared to be firmly on the path towards two percent, and the financial markets were preparing for as many as six rate cuts this year.\n\nBy contrast, futures traders currently assign a probability of just over 50 percent that the Fed will make its first rate cut by September, although they see November as much more likely, according to data from CME Group.\n\nShortly after the interest rate decision is announced, Fed chair Jerome Powell will take questions from reporters during a press conference in Washington.\n\nPowell has insisted in past public comments that the FOMC will remain \"data-dependent\" in its decision-making, and will not be swayed by politics.\n\nNevertheless, a September start to rate cuts would almost certainly thrust the Fed into the middle of a fractious presidential campaign between President Joe Biden and his Republican opponent, Donald Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the US central bank's independence.", "source": {"uri":

But policymakers signaled they now expect to cut rates only once this year, compared to the three reductions forecast in March, according to the median projection.\n\nThey now see four cuts in 2025, more than the three previously outlined.\n\nFollow the reaction in real time on Bloomberg's TOPLive blog\n\nIndividual officials' views on the best path forward for borrowing costs, however, differed. The Fed's \"dot plot\" showed four policymakers saw no cuts this year, while seven anticipated just one reduction and eight expected two cuts.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee adjusted language in its post-meeting statement released Wednesday, noting there has been \"modest further progress toward the committee's 2% inflation objective\" in recent months. Previously, the statement pointed to a \"lack\" of further progress.\n\nThe change nods to more current data showing that price growth ebbed in April and May.\n\nChair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference with reporters at 2:30 p.m. following the conclusion of a two-day meeting in Washington.\n\nFed officials have repeatedly said interest rates are likely to stay elevated for longer after price pressures picked up in the first quarter.\n\nData released earlier Wednesday offered some reassurance that progress toward their 2% inflation target has resumed. The so-called core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.2% in May and 3.4% from a year earlier, the slowest pace since 2021.\n\nBefore the decision, investors were betting the Fed would cut rates twice by year end, and saw a high likelihood of a first cut as soon as September, according to futures contracts. Other countries have already begun to lower borrowing costs. The European Central Bank cut interest rates last week, as did the Bank of Canada.\n\nFed officials also published fresh forecasts for inflation, raising their projection for underlying inflation to 2.8% from 2.6% in March.\n\nThey maintained their forecasts for economic growth and the unemployment rate at 2.1% and 4% respectively. The unemployment rate climbed to 4% in May.\n\nRestrictiveness Debate\n\nOfficials also raised their projections for where interest rates will settle in the longer term, to 2.8% from 2.6% at the March gathering. The increase, following a slight bump in March, hints policymakers expect higher interest rates are here to stay.\n\nSome officials, including Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, have said higher borrowing costs may not be slowing the economy as much as previously thought. Still others, such as New York Fed President John Williams, have said that policy is well positioned to bring inflation down to the Fed's goal.\n\nUS central bankers are engaging in a broader discussion about whether the neutral rate, or the rate at which the Fed is neither slowing nor stimulating the economy, has risen since before the pandemic. A higher neutral rate would suggest that monetary policy is not doing as much to restrain the economy.\n\nWhile US economic growth is moderating and spending is cooling, some aspects of the economy are proving more resilient to higher borrowing costs.\n\nUS nonfarm payrolls surged by 272,000 in May, surpassing all projections in a Bloomberg survey of economists, and average hourly earnings growth picked up.\n\nThe unemployment rate -- which is derived from a separate survey -- increased to 4% from 3.9%, rising to that level for the first time in over two years.\n\nThe Fed also said it would continue to shrink its balance sheet at the slower pace announced in May. Starting this month, the central bank will let its holdings of Treasury securities fall by up to $25 billion a month, down from the previous cap of $60 billion. The cap for mortgage-backed securities was left unchanged at $35 billion.\n\n--With assistance from Kristy Scheuble and Matthew Boesler.\n\n3.6 Crore Indians visited in a single day choosing us as India's undisputed platform for General Election Results.

At the same time, reducing policy rate too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment,\" he said.\n\n\"If the economy remains solid and inflation persists, we are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate as long as appropriate,\" he added.\n\nThe comments came after the Fed kept its federal funds rate unchanged between the 5.25% - 5.5% target range, as widely expected, which is the highest in 23 years.\n\nThe central bank, however, signaled it expects one interest rate cut this year, according to its projection materials that were released earlier.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Full employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2024/06/12/thumbs_b_c_d702d8803f743492d8c18bec51a9ca06.jpg?v=224210", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

decision | FOX 28 Spokane", "body": "Fresh US consumer inflation data published Wednesday is unlikely to sway the Federal Reserve's plans to leave its key lending rate unchanged, but could alter how many rate cuts policymakers pencil in for this year.\n\nThe annual consumer price index (CPI) came in at 3.3 percent in May, down 0.1 percentage point from April, the Labor Department said in a statement -- slightly below expectations.\n\nBut despite the small decline, inflation remains firmly above the Fed's long-term target of two percent, raising the chances that the US central bank will vote to hold rates at a 23-year high of between 5.25 and 5.50 percent later on Wednesday, and wait for additional clarity that inflation is easing.\n\nThe Fed's day of interest rate deliberations began as scheduled at 9:15am local time (1315 GMT), the Fed said in a statement.\n\n\"We expect guidance from the Fed to signal a prolonged pause as the bar for hikes or several cuts remains high,\" Bank of America economists wrote in a recent investor note.\n\n- Pushing back the cuts -\n\nThe US Fed has a dual mandate from Congress to tackle inflation and unemployment, and recent data suggest it remains broadly on track to manage both without pushing the United States into recession.\n\nWith cuts almost certainly off the agenda for this meeting, Wednesday's action is likely to center around the economic forecasts from the 19 members of the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which will be updated for the first time since March.\n\nAnalysts are looking to FOMC members to lower their individual forecasts for where rates will be at the end of the year in a chart known as the \"dot plot,\" bringing down the median -- or middle -- number of projected cuts this year from three down to two or fewer.\n\n\"We continue to expect the first rate cut in September,\" Goldman Sachs chief economist David Mericle wrote in a note to clients published on Sunday.\n\nHis team at Goldman sees the Fed moving to ease monetary policy every quarter after that, meaning a total of two 0.25-percentage-point cuts in 2024, and four in 2025.\n\n\"It only takes one dot moving higher to shift the median up to two 25bp (basis point) cuts -- which is our base case,\" economists at Citi wrote in a recent investor note.\n\n\"We'd be surprised to see the Fed drop two easings, but it's possible,\" economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday, while also predicting the FOMC will forecast a median of two cuts this year.\n\nOther analysts, including economists at EY and Barclays, expect the updated forecasts to show a median figure of just one rate cut for 2024.\n\n\"We anticipate the dot plot of median rate expectations will feature only one 25 basis points (bps) rate cut in 2024,\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco wrote in a note to clients.\n\n- Significant shift -\n\nIf the forecasts were to show just one cut this year, it would mark a significant shift from December, when inflation appeared to be firmly on the path towards two percent, and the financial markets were preparing for as many as six rate cuts this year.\n\nFollowing Wednesday's inflation data, futures traders raised their expectations of an interest rate cut by mid-September to almost 70 percent, up sharply from around 50 percent a day earlier, according to data from CME Group.\n\nFed chair Jerome Powell has insisted in past public comments that the FOMC will remain \"data-dependent\" in its decision-making and will not be swayed by politics.\n\nNevertheless, a September start to rate cuts would almost certainly thrust the Fed into the middle of a fractious presidential campaign between President Joe Biden and his likely Republican opponent, Donald Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the US central bank's independence.\n\nda/bfm/smw/bjt/\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox28spokane.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 28 Spokane"},

two percent, giving the US central bank an additional incentive to hold rates at a 23-year high of between 5.25 and 5.50 percent, and wait for the economic winds to change.\n\n\"We expect guidance from the Fed to signal a prolonged pause as the bar for hikes or several cuts remains high,\" Bank of America economists wrote in a recent investor note.\n\nThe US Fed has a dual mandate from Congress to tackle both inflation and unemployment, and the data suggests it remains broadly on track to tackle both without pushing the US into recession -- despite the small uptick in headline inflation in the first few months of this year.\n\nWith cuts almost certainly off the agenda for this meeting, Wednesday's action is likely to center around the economic forecasts from the 19 members of the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which will be updated for the first time since March.\n\nAnalysts are looking to FOMC members to lower their individual forecasts for where rates will be at the end of the year in a chart known as the \"dot plot,\" which reduces the median number of projected cuts this year from three down to two or fewer.\n\n\"We continue to expect the first rate cut in September,\" Goldman Sachs chief economist David Mericle wrote in a note to clients published on Sunday.\n\nHis team at Goldman sees the Fed moving to ease monetary policy every quarter after that, meaning a total of two 0.25-percentage-point cuts in 2024, and four in 2025.\n\n\"It only takes one dot moving higher to shift the median up to two 25bp (basis point) cuts -- which is our base case,\" economists at Citi wrote in a recent investor note.\n\n\"We'd be surprised to see the Fed drop two easings, but it's possible,\" economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday, while also predicting the FOMC will forecast a median of two cuts this year.\n\nOther analysts, including economists at EY and Barclays, expect the updated forecasts to show a median figure of just one rate cut for 2024.\n\n\"We anticipate the dot plot of median rate expectations will feature only one 25 basis points (bps) rate cut in 2024,\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco wrote in a note to clients.\n\nIf the forecasts were to show just one cut this year, it would mark a significant shift from December, when inflation appeared to be firmly on the path towards two percent, and the financial markets were preparing for as many as six rate cuts this year.\n\nBy contrast, futures traders currently assign a probability of just over 50 percent that the Fed will make its first rate cut by September, although they see November as much more likely, according to data from CME Group.\n\nShortly after the interest rate decision is announced, Fed chair Jerome Powell will take questions from reporters during a press conference in Washington.\n\nPowell has insisted in past public comments that the FOMC will remain \"data-dependent\" in its decision-making, and will not be swayed by politics.\n\nNevertheless, a September start to rate cuts would almost certainly thrust the Fed into the middle of a fractious presidential campaign between President Joe Biden and his Republican opponent, Donald Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the US central bank's independence.", "source": {"uri": "legit.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Legit.ng - Nigeria news."},

That is, monetary policy is a blunt tool that can be directed at either stimulating economic activity or suppressing it. The Federal Reserve Board, which directs this policy, has a number of mechanisms at its disposal, but essentially those tools fall under three alternative policy choices: easing monetary policy, tightening, or maintaining a neutral stance.\n\nEasing means accelerating the pace of monetary expansion with the corollary of lowering interest rates; tightening means retarding the growth of monetary expansion with rising interest rates; and taking a neutral stance allows interest rates to change because of market forces independent of Fed policy initiatives.\n\nIn theory, it's actually quite simple. Given the Fed's dual mandate to achieve price stability and full employment, the Fed is charged with responding when the economy deviates from a desired path - i.e., when either inflation or unemployment become unacceptably elevated. Tightening monetary policy would be required to rein in excessive inflation, while easing monetary policy would be needed to stimulate economic activity to bring unemployment lower. At any time, the Fed can do one or the other, but not both.\n\nStarting in early 2022 when inflation measured by year-over-year changes in consumer prices surpassed 7.5 percent, fighting inflation became the Fed's clear and obvious policy priority. Since that time, the Fed has raised its target for the Federal Funds interest rate - a key monetary policy indicator -- on 11 separate occasions with the stated goal of ultimately bringing inflation down to a pace of 2 percent per year. At its peak (June 2022), this measure of inflation reached 9.5 percent, but the latest reading (May 2024) was just 3.3 percent.\n\nThe most recent adjustment to the Fed's target for the Federal Funds rate was made in July of 2023, suggesting that, while still short of its 2 percent goal for inflation, the Fed has taken more of a neutral stance, waiting to see if its prior actions would have their effect with a lag all the while reserving the prospect for raising interest rates further if necessary - i.e., if the Fed sees inflation and/or inflationary expectations starting to move higher. It's also likely that as long as the Fed can point to at least some signs of progress on taming inflation, it can avoid raising interest rates further, hoping to continue to see inflation ebbing without pushing the economy into a recession.\n\nThese worries notwithstanding, the calculus seems to be at risk of changing with the release of the latest Department of Labor's report on job growth and unemployment rates. Despite a stronger than expected increase in jobs being created, the latest data (covering May 2024) reflect a slight uptick in the unemployment rate, coming in at 4 percent. While still low from an historical perspective, this rate had been as low as 3.4 percent during the first half of 2022.\n\nThe bind for the Fed is that it doesn't want to see inflation accelerate, nor does it want to see unemployment rates move higher; but taking any prophylactic action to mitigate either of these risks would probably exacerbate the other, leaving the Fed in the position where it will likely try to sit tight until one of these problems develops into something more concerning. The nightmare scenario is that conditions deteriorate on both fronts. Thankfully, the dilemma is not yet confronting us (or the Fed) . . . but, in time, it could.\n\nThe unanswered question is this: What are the trigger levels of inflation and/or unemployment that would cause the Fed to prioritize addressing one problem over the other? Unfortunately, it's complicated - particularly if both measures deteriorate simultaneously. Thus far, with the unemployment rate staying below 4 percent, it has been easy for the Fed to target taming inflation as its policy priority, but that policy choice will get harder if (or when) the unemployment rate becomes more elevated. Similarly, the Fed's appetite to try to reduce unemployment if that metric were to creep up would likely be compromised if a resurgence of inflationary pressures starts to develop.\n\nAdded to the mix is the reluctance that the Fed must feel about the inevitable criticism that would likely come to bear if the Fed were seen to be giving up on its commitment to bring inflation down to 2 percent. Failure to make good on that commitment could unleash inflationary expectations that have thus far been contained; and once that genie is out of the bottle, success in fighting inflation would become considerably harder. Fingers crossed.\n\nWhile some Fed observers still fault it for waiting too long to initiate its tight money policy back in 2022, my assessment is that that criticism is a cheap shot. As is the case with any time-series data (e.g., prices, interest rates, inflation rates, etc.), it's difficult to discern with any high degree of confidence whether a perturbation in the data reflects the onset of a trend or noise in the data that would soon be reversed. Given this inherent uncertainty, the Fed's reticence to commit to a policy of tightening too quickly seems eminently reasonable to me; and the Fed's commitment to be guided by additional data as they develop seems as appropriate now as it was then. Thus far, this orientation has served us well.", "source": {"uri": "fxstreet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FXStreet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_mandate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dual mandate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Full employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_stability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Price stability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate_derivative", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate derivative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Calculus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Time series"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Macroeconomics/MonetaryPolicy/FED/federal-reserve-27451174_Large.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Job gains have remained strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low,\" the Fed said in its statement.\n\nFollowing little progress on inflation over the first months of the year, the result was a \"dot plot\" of projected policymaker interest rate forecasts that involved a near across-the-board shift higher in the rates considered needed to finish the battle against inflation.\n\nCoupled with recent debate over the possibility that the \"neutral\" rate of interest was higher than estimated, the new dot plot suggested Fed officials have concluded higher rates are needed over a longer period of time to keep inflation in check. Summed with a previous increase in the March projection, that neutral rate is now estimated at more than a quarter of a percentage point above where it ended 2023.\n\nThe Fed aggressively raised rates in 2022 and 2023 in response to a surge in inflation that peaked at a 40-year high some two years ago.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. EDT (1830 GMT) to discuss the outcome of the latest meeting.

Job gains have remained strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low,\" the Fed said in its statement.\n\nFollowing little progress on inflation over the first months of the year, the result was a \"dot plot\" of projected policymaker interest rate forecasts that involved a near across-the-board shift higher in the rates considered needed to finish the battle against inflation.\n\nCoupled with recent debate over the possibility that the \"neutral\" rate of interest was higher than estimated, the new dot plot suggested Fed officials have concluded higher rates are needed over a longer period of time to keep inflation in check. Summed with a previous increase in the March projection, that neutral rate is now estimated at more than a quarter of a percentage point above where it ended 2023.\n\nThe Fed aggressively raised rates in 2022 and 2023 in response to a surge in inflation that peaked at a 40-year high some two years ago.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. EDT (1830 GMT) to discuss the outcome of the latest meeting.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_plot_(statistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dot plot (statistics)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Travel", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-110948019,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-40996,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 290, "textEnd": 295, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Color us skeptical on that front.\n\n\"Sure, there can be a small celebration about the progress we have made but the fact remains that three years into this cycle inflation is still running at 3.3% yoy, well above the target.\n\n\"If the goal of the Fed is to keep rates restrictive until inflation returns to target, we have many miles to go before we can rest.\"\n\n11.35am: Oracle tops the S&P leaderboard\n\nOracle is the highest riser in the S&P 500 this morning, up 10% after its AI-linked mega deals announced afterhours, which have also led to analysts upping targets this morning.\n\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said the news last night helped the market to \"have a new hook on which to hang the AI hype\".\n\nThe combination of Apple's AI announcements and Oracle reporting big demand for AI-related activities, \"has given investors something new to talk about and two different ways to play the theme instead of relying on chip giant Nvidia\", he said.\n\n10.30am: Favourable market conditions\n\nStrong institutional flows and a welcome slowing in US inflation have \"added to the most favourable market conditions for some time,\" says Jeff O'Connor, Liquidnet's head of market structure for the Americas.\n\n\"The optimism that has grown in recent weeks has been buoyed even further today by the increasing likelihood of rates cuts as early as September.\n\n\"While we are edging closer to the cyclical summer lull, conditions suggest that the market has the potential to move even higher.\n\n\"Heightened volumes, gains across a broad spectrum of strategies and strong hedge fund performance suggest that institutions are enjoying current market conditions. While geopolitical uncertainty hums in the background, if conditions continue to hold, we can expect institutions to continue to ride the wave - taking advantage of improving sentiment and plentiful liquidity.\"\n\n9.49am: US stocks rally at the open\n\nWall Street has rallied at the open, with today's cool inflation data boosting the hopes for a rate cut later this year.\n\nThe Dow Jones lifted by 0.8%, or 312 points, to 39,090, while the Nasdaq jumped more than 1%, 178 points, to 17,523.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 rose 0.9%, or 50 points, to 5,425.\n\nEconomists have welcomed easing inflation, arguing it will increase the likelihood of a September rate cut and drive dovish sentiment through the Federal Reserve.\n\nKathleen Brooks at XTB said: \"Heading into the CPI report it felt like the latest inflation data would determine the outcome of tonight's Fed meeting.\n\n\"The market has already priced in a dovish Fed: there is now a 65% chance of a September rate cut.\n\n\"The risk is that the market has got ahead of themselves pricing in a September rate cut. After all, the Fed will need to balance strong payroll growth alongside falling inflation when it makes its policy decision.\n\nNot only is there a 65% of a September rate cut, but the US interest rate futures market is also pricing in a 75% chance of a second cut in December.\n\n\"As we lead up to tonight's Fed meeting, the Fed will either be king maker, or the king of disappointment for traders later today.\"\n\n8.41am: US inflation cooler-than-expected\n\nUS stocks are set to open higher after inflation came in softer than expected, increasing the prospect of an interest rate cut later this year.\n\nCore inflation, which removes volatile fuel and food prices, was 3.4% for May, softening from the prior month's 3.6% rise and coming in lower than the 3.5% analysts had predicted.\n\nHeadline CPI inflation eased to 3.3% in May from April's 3.4% and beating consensus by one tenth of a percentage point.\n\nLower-than-expected inflation will prove a boost for the Federal Reserve, which is meeting today to set interest rates and has been looking for positive data to justify a cut later this year.\n\nAll three of the US's lead stock indexes are up, according to premarket futures.\n\nIt comes after both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs on Tuesday, with the former having been boosted by Apple reclaiming its spot as the second-largest company in the world.\n\nApple shares slipped 0.7% in pre-market trading, having closed yesterday around 7.5% higher at a new record high.", "source": {"uri": "proactiveinvestors.com", "dataType": "news",

That would have put the policy rate in the 3.75%-4% range by the end of next year.\n\nA run of stronger-than-expected inflation earlier this year has forced U.S. rate-setters to recalibrate, writing down a slower start to rate cuts in the face of an economy proving more resilient than expected to the braking power of high borrowing costs.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how data released on Wednesday showing no rise in consumer prices in May from April may have factored into their forecasts.\n\nThe Fed has kept its target for the overnight bank-to-bank lending rate in its current range since last July in a bid to squeeze high inflation out of the economy without massive harm to the job market.\n\nFour Fed policymakers feel the Fed should not cut rates at all this year, the fresh projections show. Three months ago just two thought so.\n\nMeanwhile seven policymakers believe a single rate cut will be appropriate by year's end, compared with eight who believe two rate cuts will be needed.\n\nINFLATION RETHINK\n\nPolicymakers are now penciling in a fourth-quarter inflation rate of 2.6%, based on the year-over-year change in the personal consumption expenditures price index, which they target at 2%.\n\nThat's slightly higher than the 2.4% they saw in March, according to the projections, even as they expect to keep borrowing costs higher for longer. PCE inflation registered 2.7% in each of the last two months.\n\nThe forecasts are not a consensus view, but rather a midpoint of the individual expectations of the Federal Reserve's seven Washington-based governors and the 12 Fed bank presidents that is meant to offer some guidance on policymakers' thinking.\n\nCore PCE inflation - which strips out the cost of food and energy and which the Fed uses to gauge underlying price pressures - will be at 2.8% in the fourth quarter of 2024, and at 2.3% in the fourth quarter of 2025, according to the median projections.\n\nThat compares with the March median projection of 2.6% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025.\n\nThe economic projections suggest Fed policymakers continue to expect a so-called soft landing, where the economy slows and inflation falls without a surge in joblessness.\n\nFed policymakers do see the unemployment rate, now at 4%, rising to finish 2025 at 4.2%, higher than the 4.1% they had forecast in March.\n\nThey left their forecasts for U.S. economic growth unchanged, at 2.1% this year, and 2.0% next year.\n\nFed policymakers also lifted their estimates of the longer-run neutral rate - a policy rate that neither slows nor stimulates a healthy economy - to 2.8%, from 2.6% in March and 2.5% last December. The increase may suggest that the Fed may ultimately not end up cutting rates as much as previously thought. (Reporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Andrea Ricci)\n\nMilestone Alert!

of Fed interest rate decision", "body": "WASHINGTON, June 12 -- Fresh US consumer inflation data published today is unlikely to sway the Federal Reserve's plans to leave its key lending rate unchanged, but could alter how many rate cuts policymakers pencil in for this year.\n\nThe annual consumer price index (CPI) came in at 3.3 per cent in May, down 0.1 percentage point from April, the Labor Department said in a statement -- slightly below expectations.\n\nBut despite the small decline, inflation remains firmly above the Fed's long-term target of two per cent, raising the chances that the US central bank will vote to hold rates at a 23-year high of between 5.25 and 5.50 percent later on tonight, and wait for additional clarity that inflation is easing.\n\nThe Fed's day of interest rate deliberations began as scheduled at 9.15am local time (9.15pm Malaysian time), the Fed said in a statement.\n\n\"We expect guidance from the Fed to signal a prolonged pause as the bar for hikes or several cuts remains high,\" Bank of America economists wrote in a recent investor note.\n\nPushing back the cuts\n\nThe US Fed has a dual mandate from Congress to tackle inflation and unemployment, and recent data suggest it remains broadly on track to manage both without pushing the United States into recession.\n\nWith cuts almost certainly off the agenda for this meeting, Wednesday's action is likely to centre around the economic forecasts from the 19 members of the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which will be updated for the first time since March.\n\nAnalysts are looking to FOMC members to lower their individual forecasts for where rates will be at the end of the year in a chart known as the \"dot plot,\" bringing down the median -- or middle -- number of projected cuts this year from three down to two or fewer.\n\n\"We continue to expect the first rate cut in September,\" Goldman Sachs chief economist David Mericle wrote in a note to clients published on Sunday.\n\nHis team at Goldman sees the Fed moving to ease monetary policy every quarter after that, meaning a total of two 0.25-percentage-point cuts in 2024, and four in 2025.\n\n\"It only takes one dot moving higher to shift the median up to two 25bp (basis point) cuts -- which is our base case,\" economists at Citi wrote in a recent investor note.\n\n\"We'd be surprised to see the Fed drop two easings, but it's possible,\" economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday, while also predicting the FOMC will forecast a median of two cuts this year.\n\nOther analysts, including economists at EY and Barclays, expect the updated forecasts to show a median figure of just one rate cut for 2024.\n\n\"We anticipate the dot plot of median rate expectations will feature only one 25 basis points (bps) rate cut in 2024,\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco wrote in a note to clients.\n\nSignificant shift\n\nIf the forecasts were to show just one cut this year, it would mark a significant shift from December, when inflation appeared to be firmly on the path towards two per cent, and the financial markets were preparing for as many as six rate cuts this year.\n\nFollowing Wednesday's inflation data, futures traders raised their expectations of an interest rate cut by mid-September to almost 70 per cent, up sharply from around 50 per cent a day earlier, according to data from CME Group.\n\nFed chair Jerome Powell has insisted in past public comments that the FOMC will remain \"data-dependent\" in its decision-making and will not be swayed by politics.\n\nNevertheless, a September start to rate cuts would almost certainly thrust the Fed into the middle of a fractious presidential campaign between President Joe Biden and his likely Republican opponent, Donald Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the US central bank's independence. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Rate-setters revised up their median expectation on core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) over the year to 2.8 per cent from 2.6 per cent.

At the turn of the year investors thought the cutting cycle would be well underway but now traders do not expect a cut until September.\n\nAlthough there are some signs the economy is beginning to weaken under the pressure of the Fed's rate hikes, it remains too strong to be confident that inflation will remain sustainably at two per cent.\n\nFigures out last week showed that the economy added significantly more jobs than expected in April. The Fed noted that \"job gains have remained strong and the unemployment rate has remained low\".\n\nThe decision comes a week after the European Central Bank (ECB) voted to cut interest rates for the first time in five years, reflecting the underlying weakness of the European economy.

consumer inflation falls ahead of Fed interest rate decision", "body": "Back in March, FOMC members penciled in a median of 0.75 percentage points of rate cuts this year\n\nFresh US consumer inflation data published Wednesday is unlikely to sway the Federal Reserve's plans to leave its key lending rate unchanged, but could alter how many rate cuts policymakers pencil in for this year.\n\nThe annual consumer price index (CPI) came in at 3.3 percent in May, down 0.1 percentage point from April, the Labor Department said in a statement -- slightly below expectations.\n\nBut despite the small decline, inflation remains firmly above the Fed's long-term target of two percent, raising the chances that the US central bank will vote to hold rates at a 23-year high of between 5.25 and 5.50 percent later on Wednesday, and wait for additional clarity that inflation is easing.\n\nThe Fed's day of interest rate deliberations began as scheduled at 9:15am local time (1315 GMT), the Fed said in a statement.\n\n\"We expect guidance from the Fed to signal a prolonged pause as the bar for hikes or several cuts remains high,\" Bank of America economists wrote in a recent investor note.\n\n- Pushing back the cuts -\n\nThe US Fed has a dual mandate from Congress to tackle inflation and unemployment, and recent data suggest it remains broadly on track to manage both without pushing the United States into recession.\n\nWith cuts almost certainly off the agenda for this meeting, Wednesday's action is likely to center around the economic forecasts from the 19 members of the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which will be updated for the first time since March.\n\nAnalysts are looking to FOMC members to lower their individual forecasts for where rates will be at the end of the year in a chart known as the \"dot plot,\" bringing down the median -- or middle -- number of projected cuts this year from three down to two or fewer.\n\n\"We continue to expect the first rate cut in September,\" Goldman Sachs chief economist David Mericle wrote in a note to clients published on Sunday.\n\nHis team at Goldman sees the Fed moving to ease monetary policy every quarter after that, meaning a total of two 0.25-percentage-point cuts in 2024, and four in 2025.\n\n\"It only takes one dot moving higher to shift the median up to two 25bp (basis point) cuts -- which is our base case,\" economists at Citi wrote in a recent investor note.\n\n\"We'd be surprised to see the Fed drop two easings, but it's possible,\" economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday, while also predicting the FOMC will forecast a median of two cuts this year.\n\nOther analysts, including economists at EY and Barclays, expect the updated forecasts to show a median figure of just one rate cut for 2024.\n\n\"We anticipate the dot plot of median rate expectations will feature only one 25 basis points (bps) rate cut in 2024,\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco wrote in a note to clients.\n\n- Significant shift -\n\nIf the forecasts were to show just one cut this year, it would mark a significant shift from December, when inflation appeared to be firmly on the path towards two percent, and the financial markets were preparing for as many as six rate cuts this year.\n\nFollowing Wednesday's inflation data, futures traders raised their expectations of an interest rate cut by mid-September to almost 70 percent, up sharply from around 50 percent a day earlier, according to data from CME Group.\n\nFed chair Jerome Powell has insisted in past public comments that the FOMC will remain \"data-dependent\" in its decision-making and will not be swayed by politics.\n\nNevertheless, a September start to rate cuts would almost certainly thrust the Fed into the middle of a fractious presidential campaign between President Joe Biden and his likely Republican opponent, Donald Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the US central bank's independence.\n\nda/bfm/smw/bjt/", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_avis@ktbs.com", "name": "Daniel Avis", "type": "author", "isAgency":

"title": "US inflation data unlikely to alter Fed plans to hold rates steady", "body": "Back in March, FOMC members penciled in a median of 0.75 percentage-points of rate cuts this year\n\nFresh US consumer inflation data published Wednesday is unlikely to sway the Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to leave its key lending rate unchanged and lower the number of cuts it has penciled in for this year.\n\nThe May headline consumer inflation rate is expected to be little changed from a month earlier, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIf the analysts are correct, inflation will remain stuck firmly above the Fed's long-term target of two percent, giving the US central bank an additional incentive to hold rates at a 23-year high of between 5.25 and 5.50 percent, and wait for the economic winds to change.\n\n\"We expect guidance from the Fed to signal a prolonged pause as the bar for hikes or several cuts remains high,\" Bank of America economists wrote in a recent investor note.\n\n- Pushing back the cuts -\n\nThe US Fed has a dual mandate from Congress to tackle both inflation and unemployment, and the data suggests it remains broadly on track to tackle both without pushing the US into recession -- despite the small uptick in headline inflation in the first few months of this year.\n\nWith cuts almost certainly off the agenda for this meeting, Wednesday's action is likely to center around the economic forecasts from the 19 members of the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which will be updated for the first time since March.\n\nAnalysts are looking to FOMC members to lower their individual forecasts for where rates will be at the end of the year in a chart known as the \"dot plot,\" which reduces the median number of projected cuts this year from three down to two or fewer.\n\n\"We continue to expect the first rate cut in September,\" Goldman Sachs chief economist David Mericle wrote in a note to clients published on Sunday.\n\nHis team at Goldman sees the Fed moving to ease monetary policy every quarter after that, meaning a total of two 0.25-percentage-point cuts in 2024, and four in 2025.\n\n\"It only takes one dot moving higher to shift the median up to two 25bp (basis point) cuts -- which is our base case,\" economists at Citi wrote in a recent investor note.\n\nMore from this section Sachem School Board meeting for first time since adopting new proposed budget CA: 84th Annual Peabody Awards - Arrivals - 53821890 Apple

clients on Tuesday, while also predicting the FOMC will forecast a median of two cuts this year.\n\nOther analysts, including economists at EY and Barclays, expect the updated forecasts to show a median figure of just one rate cut for 2024.\n\n\"We anticipate the dot plot of median rate expectations will feature only one 25 basis points (bps) rate cut in 2024,\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco wrote in a note to clients.\n\n- Significant shift -\n\nIf the forecasts were to show just one cut this year, it would mark a significant shift from December, when inflation appeared to be firmly on the path towards two percent, and the financial markets were preparing for as many as six rate cuts this year.\n\nBy contrast, futures traders currently assign a probability of just over 50 percent that the Fed will make its first rate cut by September, although they see November as much more likely, according to data from CME Group.\n\nShortly after the interest rate decision is announced, Fed chair Jerome Powell will take questions from reporters during a press conference in Washington.\n\nPowell has insisted in past public comments that the FOMC will remain \"data-dependent\" in its decision-making, and will not be swayed by politics.\n\nNevertheless, a September start to rate cuts would almost certainly thrust the Fed into the middle of a fractious presidential campaign between President Joe Biden and his Republican opponent, Donald Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the US central bank's independence.\n\nda/bfm/smw", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news",

With inflation above the target rate and June's consumer prices data on the horizon, the outlook for borrowing costs remains high, impacting mortgages, loans, and the presidential race amid a low unemployment rate but high consumer prices.\n\nFederal Reserve officials are preparing to update their economic forecasts this Wednesday, indicating a potential shift in the anticipated interest rate cuts. Recent inflation data shows little sign of the desired slowdown, with the core inflation rate holding steady at 0.3 percent from April to May -- higher than the Fed's target.\n\nThe Fed's projections suggest a reduction in the number of rate cuts this year, down from three to just one or two. This could result in prolonged high borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards, a disappointing outcome for aspiring homebuyers and the broader economy.\n\nThis cautious approach from the Fed could also influence the political landscape, given the public's discontent with current economic conditions under President Biden, despite low unemployment and robust consumer spending. The central bank will continue to assess economic data before making further adjustments, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasizing the need for more consistent inflation control.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Mortgages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Mortgages", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/28_05_2024_13_02_51_5644752.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

It indicates a sharp deceleration from April's 0.3% pace.\n\nWhat do these inflation readings imply for Federal Reserve policy and Chair Jerome Powell's stance? How might they influence expectations of an upcoming easing cycle?\n\nBenzinga gathered insights from six financial experts ahead of the June Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting:\n\n\"The May CPI report was undeniably soft with core and headline printing below expectations,\" said Michael Gapen, U.S. economist at Bank of America. He noted that the moderation in core inflation provides more evidence that the first quarter was an outlier and that disinflation remains on track.\n\nGapen believes the report supports the narrative that the first-quarter inflation data was more noise than signal, suggesting that inflation should continue its downward trend.\n\n\"The report fits our view of today's FOMC where we expect Powell to remain confident that a supply shock, cooling demand, and modestly restrictive policy will keep inflation trending lower and the Fed biased to cuts,\" he added.\n\nGapen does not expect a September Fed cut but acknowledged that market pricing is slightly more optimistic. Bank of America retains its outlook for the Fed to begin its cutting cycle in December.\n\nBill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, observed that prices were elevated in the early spring due to headlines about the war in the Middle East but dipped in May as demand weakened more than expected. \"Annual core CPI is down to the least since mid-2021,\" he said.\n\nAdams noted that inflation's return to the Fed's target made progress in May after a setback in the early months of 2024. \"The Fed will be glad to see inflation slow in this report, but they will wait for clearer progress toward their inflation target before they start cutting interest rates,\" he explained.\n\nComerica forecasts that the Fed will hold interest rates steady at the upcoming decisions in June and July, then start cutting interest rates in September with a quarter percentage point reduction, followed by another cut in December.\n\nJoe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US LLP, highlighted that gradual disinflation is reasserting itself and is expected to continue throughout the summer.\n\n\"This should play into the Federal Reserve's forecast, which points to a September rate cut as both the consumer price index and the personal consumption expenditures index inch back toward the Fed's long-term 2% inflation target,\" he said.\n\nBrusuelas mentioned that housing costs, which have been a concern, are starting to ease. \"We are starting to observe the long-awaited easing in housing costs,\" he added, noting that the rate of increase in housing costs has slowed compared to a year ago.\n\nHe believes that the encouraging May CPI data is likely the first in a series of constructive inflation reports that will define policy normalization at the Fed. \"Gasoline prices peaked in March, and a rising supply of global crude should provide a much-needed assist in the disinflation process,\" Brusuelas explained.\n\n\"The softness in the report was broad-based as disinflation came through many parts of the service sector, which was exactly what the Fed was looking for,\" Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, stated.\n\nThe expert highlighted declines in prices for airfares, hotels, apparel, and new cars, despite the persistence of shelter price stickiness.\n\nRipley noted that today's inflation data should bolster Powell's confidence and that of the other voting members.\n\n\"More importantly, as we look further out on the calendar, the distance from here to the first rate cut of the cycle appears to be rapidly approaching,\" he concluded.\n\nAlex McGrath, chief investment officer for NorthEnd Private Wealth, offered a tempered view, stating, \"Sure, there can be a small celebration about the progress we have made, but the fact remains that three years into this cycle, inflation is still running at 3.3% year-over-year, well above the target.\"\n\nMcGrath emphasized that if the Fed's goal is to keep rates restrictive until inflation returns to target, \"we have many miles to go before we can rest.\"\n\nQuincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial, expressed cautious optimism, stating, \"Today's CPI report -- at long last -- suggests that the disinflationary trajectory has begun to edge lower towards the Fed's price stability target.\"\n\nShe believes this should help the FOMC, which is preparing its dot plot and statement, to offer a more positive view on monetary easing.\n\n\"Despite invoking their well-practiced reminder that they remain data dependent and require additional confirmation that inflation continues to trend lower,\" Krosby added.", "source": {"uri": "markets.businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Markets Insider"}, "authors": [],

(Reuters )\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the US Federal Reserve is meeting over two days - June 11 and June 12. Global investors are closely monitoring three things emerging from June's FOMC meeting. The first is whether the US Federal Reserve will raise or cut interest rates; the second is whether Fed Chair Powell will continue to be hawkish or shift to a more dovish tone; and the third is the 'dot plot' in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is also scheduled for release today.\n\nFed Chair Powell will make the final announcement on Wednesday, June 12 at 2:00 p.m. ET. To be followed by his press conference.\n\nA rate hike, which was talked about a few weeks back, has been ruled out by the market now. As far as the rate cut is concerned, even that is not looking a possibility in June. With inflation remaining sticky, markets expect the Fed to keep the 'fed funds rate' target range unchanged at 5.25% - 5.50%.\n\nHere's how the latest US CPI inflation numbers stack up - In April, the US CPI increased 0.3 percent on monthly count while annual inflation rose by 3.4%, a smaller increase than the 3.5 percent increase for the 12 months ending March. The core-inflation index (all items less food and energy) rose 0.3 percent in April, while the annual core inflation index rose 3.6 percent over the past 12 months.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics releases May 2024 CPI data on June 12, 2024, at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time. \"Investors are awaiting today's Fed interest rate decision, which will arrive a few hours after May's CPI. June's Fed meeting is unique since it will also feature an update to the dots (Summary of Economic Projections) pointing to the number of rate reductions the committee envisions for the remainder of this year. Just because Ottawa and Frankfurt brought out the scissors doesn't mean Washington will,\" says Jos\u00e9 Torres, Senior Economist at Interactive Brokers.\n\nThe dot plot can reveal what Fed officials have been thinking about rate cuts. The dot plot indicates Fed officials' policy expectations, with investors keen to gauge the number of rate cuts they anticipate, with the most recent plot indicating three quarter-point cuts in 2024.\n\nWhat to look for in the June Fed meeting: Chris Zaccarelli, Chief Investment Officer for Independent Advisor Alliance\n\nWe will be looking at these three things heading into Wednesday's Fed statement and press conference:\n\nDot Plot - we know the Fed isn't going to cut rates at this meeting, but what does the new Dot Plot show going forward? The Fed had indicated a median of 4 rate cuts on the Dot Plot coming into this year (e.g. target dropping from 5.5% to 4.5%), but by March they had indicated only 3 rate cuts. We believe they are going to reduce that by another 1 or 2 cuts and the market is going to look closely to see how much less hawkish the Fed is acting.\n\nRate Hikes - Chairman Powell (and most of the Fed speakers) has consistently denied that they are planning any rate hikes, and if this changes, you can expect an extremely negative market reaction. The stock market has continued to move higher this year both because the economy and corporate profits have continued to expand, but also because rate hikes have been taken off the table. If this were to change, it would be a game-changer for the markets (in a bad way).\n\nInflation - how does the Fed, and Chair Powell, speak about inflation? He started out the year describing the sticker-than-expected inflation as a bump in the road or an outlier, but by the 3rd disappointing report, he changed his tune and explained that the Fed is going to need to see a lot more data coming down in order to feel \"confident\" about starting to cut rates.\n\nClearly, the stock market has been able to rally in the absence of cuts, but sooner or later lower rates will be necessary for the market to maintain its current multiples; the real economy is also going to be impacted - over time - by higher-for-longer interest rates, specifically in the housing market, but also in the auto market and even across consumer spending in general (e.g. for those purchasing items on credit cards with a balance).\n\nMeanwhile, equity market investors are having a field day. Backed by robust corporate earnings and the weightage of tech stocks in the indices, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are sitting pretty at all-time high levels. In 2024, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has risen over 14%, while the S&P 500 has gained over 12%. The more cyclical Dow has gained only 2.9% so far this year.\n\nThe equity valuations appear to be strained but equities may have some more space to run with the upcoming US elections and rate cut sessions in a few weeks. According to FactSet, the S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio for the upcoming 12 months is 20.7, which is higher than the 10- and five-year averages of 17.8 and 19.2, respectively.\n\nAs of now, the biggest threat to equity returns from underperformance is the increase in Treasury yields. Rising Treasury yields can cause stock unrest, potentially increasing borrowing costs and making equities less attractive than bonds due to higher yields.", "source": {"uri": "financialexpress.com",

"US consumer inflation falls ahead of Fed interest rate decision", "body": "Back in March, FOMC members penciled in a median of 0.75 percentage points of rate cuts this year\n\nFresh US consumer inflation data published Wednesday is unlikely to sway the Federal Reserve's plans to leave its key lending rate unchanged, but could alter how many rate cuts policymakers pencil in for this year.\n\nThe annual consumer price index (CPI) came in at 3.3 percent in May, down 0.1 percentage point from April, the Labor Department said in a statement -- slightly below expectations.\n\nBut despite the small decline, inflation remains firmly above the Fed's long-term target of two percent, raising the chances that the US central bank will vote to hold rates at a 23-year high of between 5.25 and 5.50 percent later on Wednesday, and wait for additional clarity that inflation is easing.\n\nThe Fed's day of interest rate deliberations began as scheduled at 9:15am local time (1315 GMT), the Fed said in a statement.\n\n\"We expect guidance from the Fed to signal a prolonged pause as the bar for hikes or several cuts remains high,\" Bank of America economists wrote in a recent investor note.\n\n- Pushing back the cuts -\n\nThe US Fed has a dual mandate from Congress to tackle inflation and unemployment, and recent data suggest it remains broadly on track to manage both without pushing the United States into recession.\n\nWith cuts almost certainly off the agenda for this meeting, Wednesday's action is likely to center around the economic forecasts from the 19 members of the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which will be updated for the first time since March.\n\nAnalysts are looking to FOMC members to lower their individual forecasts for where rates will be at the end of the year in a chart known as the \"dot plot,\" bringing down the median -- or middle -- number of projected cuts this year from three down to two or fewer.\n\n\"We continue to expect the first rate cut in September,\" Goldman Sachs chief economist David Mericle wrote in a note to clients published on Sunday.\n\nHis team at Goldman sees the Fed moving to ease monetary policy every quarter after that, meaning a total of two 0.25-percentage-point cuts in 2024, and four in 2025.\n\nMore from this section $2M check presented today for renovation of Crotona Parkway Malls Man accused of killing Sayreville councilwoman Eunice Dwumfour appears in court Hong Kong cancels passports of six democracy activists\n\n\"It only takes one dot moving higher to shift the median up to two 25bp (basis point) cuts -- which is our base case,\" economists at Citi wrote in a recent investor note.\n\n\"We'd be surprised to see the Fed drop two easings, but it's possible,\" economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday, while also predicting the FOMC will forecast a median of two cuts this year.\n\nOther analysts, including economists at EY and Barclays, expect the updated forecasts to show a median figure of just one rate cut for 2024.\n\n\"We anticipate the dot plot of median rate expectations will feature only one 25 basis points (bps) rate cut in 2024,\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco wrote in a note to clients.\n\n- Significant shift -\n\nIf the forecasts were to show just one cut this year, it would mark a significant shift from December, when inflation appeared to be firmly on the path towards two percent, and the financial markets were preparing for as many as six rate cuts this year.\n\nFollowing Wednesday's inflation data, futures traders raised their expectations of an interest rate cut by mid-September to almost 70 percent, up sharply from around 50 percent a day earlier, according to data from CME Group.\n\nFed chair Jerome Powell has insisted in past public comments that the FOMC will remain \"data-dependent\" in its decision-making and will not be swayed by politics.\n\nNevertheless, a September start to rate cuts would almost certainly thrust the Fed into the middle of a fractious presidential campaign between President Joe Biden and his likely Republican opponent, Donald Trump,

But policymakers signaled they now expect to cut rates only once this year, compared to the three reductions forecast in March, according to the median projection.\n\nThey now see four cuts in 2025, more than the three previously outlined.\n\nIndividual officials' views on the best path forward for borrowing costs, however, differed. The Fed's \"dot plot\" showed four policymakers saw no cuts this year, while seven anticipated just one reduction and eight expected two cuts.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee adjusted language in its post-meeting statement released Wednesday, noting there has been \"modest further progress toward the committee's 2 per cent inflation objective\" in recent months. Previously, the statement pointed to a \"lack\" of further progress.\n\nThe change nods to more current data showing that price growth ebbed in April and May.\n\nChair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference with reporters at 2:30 p.m. following the conclusion of a two-day meeting in Washington.\n\nFed officials have repeatedly said interest rates are likely to stay elevated for longer after price pressures picked up in the first quarter.\n\nData released earlier Wednesday offered some reassurance that progress toward their 2 per cent inflation target has resumed. The so-called core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.2 per cent in May and 3.4 per cent from a year earlier, the slowest pace since 2021.\n\nBefore the decision, investors were betting the Fed would cut rates twice by year end, and saw a high likelihood of a first cut as soon as September, according to futures contracts. Other countries have already begun to lower borrowing costs. The European Central Bank cut interest rates last week, as did the Bank of Canada.\n\nFed officials also published fresh forecasts for inflation, raising their projection for underlying inflation to 2.8 per cent from 2.6 per cent in March.\n\nThey maintained their forecasts for economic growth and the unemployment rate at 2.1 per cent and 4 per cent respectively. The unemployment rate climbed to 4 per cent in May.\n\nRestrictiveness Debate\n\nOfficials also raised their projections for where interest rates will settle in the longer term, to 2.8 per cent from 2.6 per cent at the March gathering. The increase, following a slight bump in March, hints policymakers expect higher interest rates are here to stay.\n\nSome officials, including Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, have said higher borrowing costs may not be slowing the economy as much as previously thought. Still others, such as New York Fed President John Williams, have said that policy is well positioned to bring inflation down to the Fed's goal.\n\nU.S. central bankers are engaging in a broader discussion about whether the neutral rate, or the rate at which the Fed is neither slowing nor stimulating the economy, has risen since before the pandemic. A higher neutral rate would suggest that monetary policy is not doing as much to restrain the economy.\n\nWhile U.S. economic growth is moderating and spending is cooling, some aspects of the economy are proving more resilient to higher borrowing costs.\n\nU.S. nonfarm payrolls surged by 272,000 in May, surpassing all projections in a Bloomberg survey of economists, and average hourly earnings growth picked up.\n\nThe unemployment rate -- which is derived from a separate survey -- increased to 4 per cent from 3.9 per cent, rising to that level for the first time in over two years.\n\nThe Fed also said it would continue to shrink its balance sheet at the slower pace announced in May. Starting this month, the central bank will let its holdings of Treasury securities fall by up to US$25 billion a month, down from the previous cap of $60 billion. The cap for mortgage-backed securities was left unchanged at $35 billion.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Dallas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage-backed_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage-backed security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Treasury security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy_and_Forecasting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy and Forecasting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.2084393!/fileimage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/fed.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

That move was telegraphed by Fed officials well in advance and was anticipated by financial markets.\n\nFed officials also on average projected cutting the rate by 0.25 percentage points by the end of the year, a much slower pace than the three-quarters of a point cut they anticipated when they last made their quarterly projections in March.\n\n\"Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated,\" The committee said in an official statement. \"In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the Committee's 2% inflation objective.\"\n\nThat language was identical to the statement from the Fed's May meeting other than changing \"a lack of\" further progress to \"modest.\"\n\nThe outlook for potential rate cuts has shifted over the course of the year with each new bit of economic data.\n\nAt first, fed officials and markets were more optimistic about lower rates, projecting as many as six quarter-point rate cuts this year. But that soured this spring after a string of hotter-than-expected inflation reports in the first quarter prompted Fed officials to say they'd keep rates higher for longer to fight price increases.\n\nTwo relatively tame inflation reports in a row, including one Wednesday morning, revived hopes for earlier cuts, and many economists were expecting FOMC members to still pencil in one or two by the end of the year.\n\nA lower fed funds rate would be cause for celebration for pretty much anyone who wants to borrow money since rate cuts could help push down credit card interest and mortgage rates from their current levels, which are close to the highest in decades.\n\nWhile the Fed holding the fed funds rate flat was widely expected by financial markets, the outlook for rate movements later in the year was much more up in the air.

The Fed's decision comes amidst a backdrop of \"modest\" progress towards its inflation target of two percent.\n\nThe central bank, in a unanimous vote, decided to keep its benchmark interest rate between 5.25 and 5.50 percent. This suggests that policymakers are cautious about reducing rates too quickly, despite recent data indicating a slowdown in the rate of price increases for consumers in May.\n\nAccording to the Labor Department, the annual consumer price index (CPI) stood at 3.3 percent last month, slightly lower than April's figure and in line with market expectations. This data could have influenced the Fed's decision-making process.\n\nIn addition to maintaining the interest rate, the Fed also updated economic forecasts from members of its rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Individual projections for the number of rate cuts this year were lowered, with the median projection for interest rates at the end of 2024 falling between 4.50 and 4.75 percent.\n\nThis means that FOMC participants now anticipate only one 0.25 percentage point cut by the end of the year, which is two fewer cuts than previously projected in March. Furthermore, Fed officials raised their inflation forecasts for 2024 while keeping their growth outlook unchanged.\n\nThe Fed's decision and updated forecasts reflect a cautious approach to monetary policy, balancing the need to support economic growth with concerns about maintaining price stability.

"title": "US inflation data unlikely to alter Fed plans to hold rates steady", "body": "Back in March, FOMC members penciled in a median of 0.75 percentage-points of rate cuts this year\n\nFresh US consumer inflation data published Wednesday is unlikely to sway the Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to leave its key lending rate unchanged and lower the number of cuts it has penciled in for this year.\n\nThe May headline consumer inflation rate is expected to be little changed from a month earlier, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIf the analysts are correct, inflation will remain stuck firmly above the Fed's long-term target of two percent, giving the US central bank an additional incentive to hold rates at a 23-year high of between 5.25 and 5.50 percent, and wait for the economic winds to change.\n\n\"We expect guidance from the Fed to signal a prolonged pause as the bar for hikes or several cuts remains high,\" Bank of America economists wrote in a recent investor note.\n\n- Pushing back the cuts -\n\nThe US Fed has a dual mandate from Congress to tackle both inflation and unemployment, and the data suggests it remains broadly on track to tackle both without pushing the US into recession -- despite the small uptick in headline inflation in the first few months of this year.\n\nWith cuts almost certainly off the agenda for this meeting, Wednesday's action is likely to center around the economic forecasts from the 19 members of the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which will be updated for the first time since March.\n\nAnalysts are looking to FOMC members to lower their individual forecasts for where rates will be at the end of the year in a chart known as the \"dot plot,\" which reduces the median number of projected cuts this year from three down to two or fewer.\n\n\"We continue to expect the first rate cut in September,\" Goldman Sachs chief economist David Mericle wrote in a note to clients published on Sunday.\n\nHis team at Goldman sees the Fed moving to ease monetary policy every quarter after that, meaning a total of two 0.25-percentage-point cuts in 2024, and four in 2025.\n\n\"It only takes one dot moving higher to shift the median up to two 25bp (basis point) cuts -- which is our base case,\" economists at Citi wrote in a recent investor note.\n\n\"We'd be surprised to see the Fed drop two easings, but it's possible,\" economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday, while also predicting the FOMC will forecast a median of two cuts this year.\n\nOther analysts, including economists at EY and Barclays, expect the updated forecasts to show a median figure of just one rate cut for 2024.\n\n\"We anticipate the dot plot of median rate expectations will feature only one 25 basis points (bps) rate cut in 2024,\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco wrote in a note to clients.\n\n- Significant shift -\n\nIf the forecasts were to show just one cut this year, it would mark a significant shift from December, when inflation appeared to be firmly on the path towards two percent, and the financial markets were preparing for as many as six rate cuts this year.\n\nBy contrast, futures traders currently assign a probability of just over 50 percent that the Fed will make its first rate cut by September, although they see November as much more likely, according to data from CME Group.\n\nShortly after the interest rate decision is announced, Fed chair Jerome Powell will take questions from reporters during a press conference in Washington.\n\nPowell has insisted in past public comments that the FOMC will remain \"data-dependent\" in its decision-making, and will not be swayed by politics.\n\nNevertheless, a September start to rate cuts would almost certainly thrust the Fed into the middle of a fractious presidential campaign between President Joe Biden and his Republican opponent, Donald Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the US central bank's independence.\n\nda/bfm/smw\n\nMore from this section\n\nVoices for Humanity Goes the Extra Mile to Battle Drug

Consumer prices fell below economists' expectations for the second month in a row.\n\nInflation was flat last month and was up 3.3% year-over-year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported, a data point that could put the Federal Reserve back on track to ease its policy later this year after a series of discouraging inflation reports in the first quarter.\n\nThree rate cuts by the end of 2024 are back on the table, with investors seeing a 72% chance the Fed could cut rates three times or more by December, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nSome Wall Street analysts predict the Fed's first cut could come as soon as July, though most see a rate cut in September as the most likely scenario.\n\n\"Wednesday's weaker-than-expected CPI will allow the Fed to start cutting interest rates as soon as September, since we have now seen multiple encouraging inflation readings, after the concerning spike in inflation earlier this year,\" Skyler Weinand, the chief investment officer of Regan Capital, said in a note. \"There's a clear path to a soft landing and the Fed may very well be coming to the market's rescue in as little as three months.\"\n\n\"Today's news would seem to open the door to a July rate cut, although we still think that's very unlikely given hawkish rhetoric from the Fed recently,\" Preston Caldwell, Morningstar's chief US economist said in a statement. \"But rate cuts starting by September should now be cemented as overwhelming likely.\"\n\nHeadline inflation has eased, partly due to cooling gas and food prices. BLS data shows that the gas index slumped 3.6% in May. Meanwhile, the food at home index remained level after dropping 0.2% in April.\n\n\"The Fed is increasingly risking a downturn in the economy by leaving rates too high for too long,\" Ryan Severino, the chief economist for BGO said on Wednesday. \"While our modeling suggests that the Fed could cut later this year, it does not have infinite time on its hands, especially as we see more evidence of slowing in the US economy.\"\n\nInvestors are waiting for Fed Chair Jerome Powell to speak later this afternoon, which should give markets more guidance on the path of rate cuts. But the chief central banker will likely hold off on rate cut signals for now, Weinand said, thanks to hotter-than-expected inflation prints all throughout the first quarter.\n\n\"Things are playing out as the Fed hoped, so Jerome Powell will probably be feeling good this afternoon,\" David Russell, TradeStation's global head of market strategy, said in a note. \"The bears have nowhere to run to and nowhere to hide.\"", "source": {"uri": "markets.businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Markets Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_sor@markets.businessinsider.com", "name": "Jennifer Sor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_investment_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief investment officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headline_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Headline inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/6669b7c2ed9a404d829cdb6b?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Blockbuster hiring in May exceeded the average number of jobs added each month over the previous year, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said.\n\nAverage hourly wages surged 4.1% over the year ending in May, the report found. That rate of pay increase exceeds the pace of inflation, indicating that the spending power of workers has grown even as prices jump.\n\nThe data marks a boon for workers but could give pause to policymakers, since they fear that a rise in pay could prompt businesses to raise prices in order to cover the added labor cost.\n\nEconomic output slowed markedly at the outset of 2024, though it continued to grow at a solid pace.\n\nThe Fed, in turn, has all but abandoned a previous forecast of three interest rate cuts by the end of the year.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making body on interest rates, said last month that it does not anticipate cutting interest rates until it retains confidence that inflation is moving sustainably downward.\n\n\"So far the data has not given us that greater confidence,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference in Washington, D.C., last month. \"It is likely that gaining such greater confidence will take longer than previously expected.\"\n\nEconomists expect the Fed to hold interest rates steady for the seventh consecutive time at the close of its meeting on Wednesday.\n\nThe Fed risks a rebound of inflation if it cuts interest rates too quickly, since stronger consumer demand on top of solid economic activity could lead to an acceleration of price increases.\n\nA prolonged period of high interest rates, however, threatens to place downward pressure on economic growth and plunge the U.S. into a recession.\n\nPrice increases have drawn attention from voters as the U.S. hurtles toward what appears to be a closely contested presidential election in the fall.\n\nEighty-five percent of U.S. adults surveyed by ABC News/Ipsos last month said inflation is an important issue, making it the second-highest priority among adults surveyed.

The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation released data on June 12, confirming that India's headline retail inflation was 4.75% in May, following a rate of 4.83% in April. In its latest policy review, the RBI maintained its FY25 inflation forecast at 4.5% but noted that food prices could remain persistently high.\n\nIn April, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation was recorded at 4.83%. This headline rate has remained below 5% for three consecutive months since March 2024. The significant reduction in the headline inflation rate was primarily due to a decline of 3.83% in the fuel and light category in May.

The Consumer Price Food Index (CPFI) stayed nearly unchanged at 8.69% in May, compared to 8.7% recorded a month earlier.\n\nLast Friday, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das stated that inflation is anticipated to drop below 4% in the second quarter of 2024-25.

It indicates a sharp deceleration from April's 0.3% pace.\n\nWhat do these inflation readings imply for Federal Reserve policy and Chair Jerome Powell's stance? How might they influence expectations of an upcoming easing cycle?\n\nBenzinga gathered insights from six financial experts ahead of the June Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting:\n\nBank of America Sticks To One-Cut Call \"The May CPI report was undeniably soft with core and headline printing below expectations,\" said Michael Gapen, U.S. economist at Bank of America. He noted that the moderation in core inflation provides more evidence that the first quarter was an outlier and that disinflation remains on track.\n\nGapen believes the report supports the narrative that the first-quarter inflation data was more noise than signal, suggesting that inflation should continue its downward trend.\n\n\"The report fits our view of today's FOMC where we expect Powell to remain confident that a supply shock, cooling demand, and modestly restrictive policy will keep inflation trending lower and the Fed biased to cuts,\" he added.\n\nGapen does not expect a September Fed cut but acknowledged that market pricing is slightly more optimistic. Bank of America retains its outlook for the Fed to begin its cutting cycle in December.\n\nComerica Expects A Rate Cut In September, Followed By Another In December Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, observed that prices were elevated in the early spring due to headlines about the war in the Middle East but dipped in May as demand weakened more than expected. \"Annual core CPI is down to the least since mid-2021,\" he said.\n\nAdams noted that inflation's return to the Fed's target made progress in May after a setback in the early months of 2024. \"The Fed will be glad to see inflation slow in this report, but they will wait for clearer progress toward their inflation target before they start cutting interest rates,\" he explained.\n\nComerica forecasts that the Fed will hold interest rates steady at the upcoming decisions in June and July, then start cutting interest rates in September with a quarter percentage point reduction, followed by another cut in December.\n\nA Long-Awaited Easing In Housing Costs Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US LLP, highlighted that gradual disinflation is reasserting itself and is expected to continue throughout the summer.\n\n\"This should play into the Federal Reserve's forecast, which points to a September rate cut as both the consumer price index and the personal consumption expenditures index inch back toward the Fed's long-term 2% inflation target,\" he said.\n\nBrusuelas mentioned that housing costs, which have been a concern, are starting to ease. \"We are starting to observe the long-awaited easing in housing costs,\" he added, noting that the rate of increase in housing costs has slowed compared to a year ago.\n\nHe believes that the encouraging May CPI data is likely the first in a series of constructive inflation reports that will define policy normalization at the Fed. \"Gasoline prices peaked in March, and a rising supply of global crude should provide a much-needed assist in the disinflation process,\" Brusuelas explained.\n\nBroad-Based Disinflation \"The softness in the report was broad-based as disinflation came through many parts of the service sector, which was exactly what the Fed was looking for,\" Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, stated.\n\nThe expert highlighted declines in prices for airfares, hotels, apparel, and new cars, despite the persistence of shelter price stickiness.\n\nRipley noted that today's inflation data should bolster Powell's confidence and that of the other voting members.\n\n\"More importantly, as we look further out on the calendar, the distance from here to the first rate cut of the cycle appears to be rapidly approaching,\" he concluded.\n\nLong Road Ahead Alex McGrath, chief investment officer for NorthEnd Private Wealth, offered a tempered view, stating, \"Sure, there can be a small celebration about the progress we have made, but the fact remains that three years into this cycle, inflation is still running at 3.3% year-over-year, well above the target.\"\n\nMcGrath emphasized that if the Fed's goal is to keep rates restrictive until inflation returns to target, \"we have many miles to go before we can rest.\"\n\nCautious Optimism Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial, expressed cautious optimism, stating, \"Today's CPI report -- at long last -- suggests that the disinflationary trajectory has begun to edge lower towards the Fed's price stability target.\"\n\nShe believes this should help the FOMC, which is preparing its dot plot and statement, to offer a more positive view on monetary easing.\n\n\"Despite invoking their well-practiced reminder that they remain data dependent and require additional confirmation that inflation continues to trend lower,\" Krosby added.\n\nTickers To Watch: Markets reacted positively to the inflation news. Stocks and bonds rallied. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) were 1.2% and 1.6% higher, respectively, by 10:50 a.m. ET.\n\nNow Read: Soft Inflation Data Boosts Small Caps, Real Estate, Regional Banks; Traders Anticipate Fed Rate Cuts As Stocks React\n\nImage: Midjourney", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disinflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comerica", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comerica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_shock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply shock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outlier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_rigidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nominal rigidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPL_Financial", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LPL Financial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HM Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allianz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_investment_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief investment officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IShares", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IShares"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merchant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Information_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Information Services", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXNPEB5S0BT_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

This figure is lower than both the previous and expected 3.4%. The monthly variation in the overall consumer basket was flat, falling short of the predicted 0.1% and sharply decelerating from April's 0.3% pace.\n\nA key factor in May's disinflation was a 2% reduction in the energy index, with fuel prices dropping 3.6% month-over-month. Excluding food and energy items, core inflation also cooled from 3.6% to 3.4%, easing more than the expected 3.5%. On a monthly basis, the underlying inflation measure advanced at a 0.2% pace, lower than the predicted 0.3%.\n\nThe cooler-than-expected inflation report reignited market expectations for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Before the release, traders had assigned a 54% chance of a September rate cut, which increased to over 70% by 2:45 p.m. CET.\n\nThis shift indicates that the market is now more inclined to bet on the start of the Fed rate cut cycle by the end of the summer.\n\nOverall, markets are pricing in 54 basis points of cuts -- equivalent to two 25-basis-point rate reductions -- by year-end.\n\nUS Treasury yields tumbled by more than 10 basis points following the inflation report, easing pressure on the European bond market.\n\nEuropean bond yields, which had seen sharp increases following the recent parliamentary election results, also softened.\n\nBund yields dropped by 6 basis points, while yields on 10-year French OATs, Spanish Bonos, and Italian BTPs fell by 7, 9, and 13 basis points respectively on Wednesday.\n\nEuropean equities turned green after three consecutive sessions of losses. The broader Euro Stoxx 50 rose by 1%, reversing Tuesday's decline. The German DAX and the Italian FTSE MIB increased by 1.1% and 1.4% respectively. The French CAC 40 index also rose by 0.7%, although it underperformed its peers.\n\nThe U.S. dollar weakened sharply against major currencies, with the euro-dollar exchange rate rising by 0.8% to above 1.0820, marking its strongest performance since late December 2023.\n\nAttention now shifts to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting at 8:00 p.m. CET.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to maintain the federal funds rate between 5.25% and 5.50% for the seventh consecutive meeting, yet the major attention will be on the new staff economic projections.\n\nInvestors will closely monitor whether Fed policymakers adjust the median rate cut projections, which in March indicated three rate cuts in 2024, followed by three more in both 2025 and 2026.\n\nAny downward revision to the expected rate cuts could temper market excitement following the lower-than-expected inflation report. Conversely, if the Fed confirms these forecasts, it would signal confidence that inflation is gradually moving towards the 2% target.\n\nThe Fed will also unveil projections on inflation and economic growth. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to hold a press conference at 8:30 p.m. CET to discuss these developments. Investors will be particularly attentive to Powell's remarks for any hints about the future trajectory of interest rates and the overall economic outlook.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Consumer Price Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disinflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_MIB", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FTSE MIB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAC_40", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CAC 40"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/49/82/00/1200x675_cmsv2_2eecf497-d789-5ff3-9dab-cd13cfdd6ba2-8498200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

The federal funds rate has been set to its current level in an attempt to tame inflation, with the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, the personal consumption expenditure index, rising 2.7% for the year and 0.3% in the month in April.\n\nThe more broadly watched measure of inflation, the consumer price index, was released to the public for May just hours ahead of the Fed's decision, remaining flat for the month and rising 3.3% on an annual basis, far higher than the Fed's 2% target.

The US dollar fell, gold surged, and Treasury prices increased, reflecting investor optimism. Analysts, however, anticipate further evidence is needed for sustained interest rate cuts.\n\nGlobal shares rallied, while the dollar sank and gold surged on Wednesday, after data showed U.S. consumer inflation was a lot milder than expected in May, increasing the chances of a markets-friendly interest rate cut as soon as September. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said U.S. consumer prices were unchanged in May, thanks to a drop in the cost of gasoline. This followed a 0.3% increase in April.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had expected a rise of 0.1%. The dollar index, which measures the performance of the U.S. currency against six others, fell 0.7%, heading for its largest one-day drop in around a month.\n\nU.S. stock futures rose between 0.8-1% after the numbers, from having shown a gain of just 0.1% earlier in the day. European shares bounced, pushing the STOXX 600 up by more than 1%. Even though prices did not change on a monthly basis, inflation likely remains too high for the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates before September against the backdrop of a persistently strong jobs market.\n\nThe Fed wraps up a policy meeting later in the day. Wednesday's inflation figures may have offered investors some encouragement that rates are about to drop. But in light of last week's forecast-beating employment numbers, analysts said Fed Chair Jerome Powell may need more evidence to be convinced inflation is evaporating.\n\n\"While September may be on the table, today would have had to be the first of a handful of inflation data prints that went right, which it did,\" Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said. \"It does remain challenging, however, for inflation to cool with the backdrop of the summer's heat. Let's see what the Fed forecasts this afternoon. This is good news, but we will need more of it,\" Rosner said.\n\nU.S. Treasury prices leapt, pushing yields down, as investors piled into fixed income. The yield on the two-year note, the most sensitive to shifts in expectations for monetary policy, fell by as much as 15 basis points to a low of 4.687%. Ten-year notes were last yielding 4.291%, showing a drop of 11 bps on the day. Next up is the Fed rate decision. The central bank is not expected to make any change to interest rates at its policy meeting. Instead, the focus will be on whether it keeps three rate cuts in its \"dot plot\" projections for this year.\n\nAfter the consumer inflation figures, rate futures implied a 70% chance of a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, compared with around 60% earlier on.. \"The (inflation) data does lessen the chances of a hawkish shift in Chair Powell's rhetoric at the post meeting press conference, even if the dot plot is likely to show a median expectation of 50bp, from 75bp, of cuts this year,\" Pepperstone market analyst Michael Brown said.\n\nWith the dollar under pressure and yields falling, gold , which had been trading in negative territory before the CPI data, was up 0.6% at $2,328 an ounce, while crude oil extended gains, rising 1.2% on the day to $82.80 a barrel.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell may signal a rate cut cycle timeline at the upcoming meeting.\n\nThere are no expectations of a rate cut from the US Federal Reserve in its June policy meeting. The US central bank's policy-setting committee, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), will announce its policy decision on Wednesday, June 12, after a two-day meeting.\n\nPersistent inflation and a robust economy have been the primary drivers of the US's sustained high interest rate environment.\n\nExperts say the Fed is widely expected to keep its benchmark rate steady at 5.25-5.50 per cent, a 23-year high, this time, as the decline in inflation has not met the Fed's expectations.\n\nHowever, the June policy meeting is important as Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to offer signals on the timeline for the rate cut cycle.\n\n\"The June FOMC meeting will be one of the most pivotal events this year as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may provide the clearest hint about the rate-cut timetable.

Professional and business services hired 32,000 more workers.\n\n\"Average hourly earnings rose 0.4 per cent after slowing to a 0.2 per cent rate in April. Wages increased 4.1 per cent in the 12 months through May, following an upwardly revised 4 per cent annual rise the prior month. Wage growth in a 3-3.5 per cent range is seen as consistent with the Fed's 2 per cent inflation target,\" reported Reuters.\n\nHowever, data also showed that the unemployment rate rose to 4 per cent in May from 3.9 per cent in April.\n\nAlso Read: Citi Now Expects First Fed Rate Cut in September, Not July\n\nOn Tuesday, the World Bank raised its 2024 global growth outlook due to the strong US economy.\n\nAccording to a Reuters report, the World Bank expects the global economy to stabilise at 2.6 per cent in 2024, unchanged from 2023, and up 0.2 percentage point from the World Bank's January forecast.\n\nThe World Bank is now forecasting 2.5 per cent US growth for 2024 - matching the 2023 pace - and up sharply from the January forecast of 1.6 per cent.\n\nStrong growth indicators indicate the Fed may keep rates higher for a longer period unless it is convinced that elevated interest rates exert significant pressure on the economy.\n\nIn April, the US personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index rose 0.3 per cent. On a yearly basis, the PCE price index remained stable, rising 2.7 per cent after increasing at the same pace in March. The PCE price index is one of the key inflation measures the US Fed tracks.\n\nAdditionally, the US Labor Department is set to release May's Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on Wednesday.

The Fed has moved in 25-basis-point increments over the last year or so, indicating the central bank expects to cut interest rates one time in 2024.\n\nRead more: What the Fed rate decision means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\n\nAlong with its policy announcement, the Fed released updated economic forecasts in its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), including its \"dot plot,\" which maps out policymakers' expectations for where interest rates could be headed in the future.\n\nIn total, 15 officials predicted a rate cut this year, but it was a close call between one or two cuts. Eight officials estimate two cuts, while seven officials see just one cut. Four predict no cuts at all. Notably, no officials project three cuts compared to nine in March. Officials also do not see rates ticking higher in 2024, consistent with March.\n\nNext year, the majority of officials see the fed funds rate hitting 4.1%, suggesting four additional rate cuts to come in 2025 -- up from the prior forecast of three.\n\nThe updated projections suggest the Federal Reserve will maintain a \"higher for longer\" policy stance as the central bank works to bring inflation back down to its 2% target.\n\nImmediately following the announcement, markets were pricing in a roughly 71% chance the Federal Reserve will begin to cut rates at its September meeting, up from about 53% the day prior, according to data from the CME Group. Markets had been pricing in between one to two cuts heading into the release.\n\nThe central bank left interest rates unchanged in a range of 5.25%-5.5% at the conclusion of its meeting on Wednesday. Earlier in the day, a cooler-than-expected reading on inflation delivered welcome news for Fed policymakers, but it is unlikely to change the central bank's stance on rates.\n\nThe SEP indicated the Federal Reserve sees core inflation peaking at 2.8% this year -- higher than March's projection of 2.6% -- before cooling to 2.3% in 2025 and 2.0% in 2026.\n\nOfficials see the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.0% in 2024, matching the previous forecast. Unemployment is expected to tick higher to 4.2% in 2025 before coming down to 4.1% in 2026.\n\nThe Fed maintained its previous forecast for US economic growth, with the economy expected to grow at an annualized pace of 2.1% this year before ticking down slightly to 2.0% in 2025 and remaining at that level through 2026.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

What does that mean for CA mortgages?", "body": "Waiting to see lending rates drop? Keep waiting. It's unlikely to happen anytime soon, as the Federal Reserve on Wednesday said it would not lower its key interest rate now and suggested only one rate cut by the end of the year.\n\nFed action on interest rates is regarded as a key indicator of what consumers can expect as they buy homes, cars and other big-ticket items.\n\nWhile the Fed could act at any time, it is next scheduled to consider rates at the end of July.\n\nWhat all this means in California is that the state's economy should continue to grow at a steady if unspectacular pace.\n\n\"While there are still challenges ahead -- notably, state and local government finance, homelessness, and out-migration -- the forces driving California's economy remain robust,\" said Jerry Nickelsburg, director of the UCLA Anderson forecast.\n\nBut getting a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage under 7% could be challenging, said Jacob Channel, senior economist at LendingTree, which tracks interest rates.\n\nThe Fed's goal has been to get the rate of inflation down to a 2% annual rate. Higher interest rates are aimed at slowing demand, which in turn is supposed to motivate sellers to lower their prices in order to attract reluctant customers.\n\nThe Fed has raised its target rate 11 times starting in March 2022, but has not increased the rate since last July. Its target rate remains 5.25% to 5.00%.\n\nThe rate of inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022, but has since declined.\n\nIn California, prices increased at an average of 4% last year but are on pace for a 3.1% increase this year, according to this month's UCLA Anderson economic forecast. The state rate is expected to slow to 2.7% next year and 2.4% in 2026.\n\nThe national rate, announced Wednesday, has been 3.3% for the past 12 months, but May's seasonally adjusted rate was unchanged from the previous month. The Fed closely watches the pace of personal consumption expenditures, which rose 2.7% in the 12 months ending in March.\n\nThe Fed on Wednesday said in a statement that \"the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance over the past year.\" But it added that \"the economic outlook is uncertain, and the (Fed) remains highly attentive to inflation risks.\"\n\nIt offered no solid hint of when it could adjust rates.\n\nThe Fed said it \"does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.\"\n\nA thriving California economy\n\nWhether or not lower interest rates could stoke an even stronger recovery is uncertain. While the state's economy is doing well, and projected to remain fairly strong, housing affordability remains a problem.\n\nLendingTree's Channel explained the Fed can influence home mortgage rates but other factors are involved, as well, such as developments in the bond market.\n\nChannel predicted, \"Mortgage rates will likely continue to fluctuate, and it's impossible to say for certain where they'll end up.\"\n\nThe mortgage lending rate on a 30-year fixed rate loan was 6.99% last week, according to Freddie Mac, which tracks rates. Over the past year, the rate has averaged 7.01%.\n\nIn California, year-to-date sales of existing single-family homes were up as of April.

The agency noted that these two indexes, combined, contributed over 70% of the monthly increase in the CPI for all items.\n\nThe shelter index annually jumped 5.5% in April on an unadjusted basis, according to the agency's figures.\n\nWurm said the main source of US inflation at this stage is shelter, which has been slow to reflect declines in rent growth over the past year.\n\n\"Leading indicators, like Zillow's observed rent index, had already decelerated from over 15% year-ago rent growth in 2022 to low single digits by last summer. This trend is reflected with significant lag in the official inflation statistics, which include estimated owner equivalent rent. Harmonized measures of inflation, which exclude this component, have been showing inflation roughly consistent with the Fed's 2% target since late 2023,\" he explained.\n\n\"While each measure has its problems, shelter inflation in the official CPI and PCE statistics will thus gradually decline in the coming months,\" he added.\n\n'Energy likely to act disinflationary in coming months'\n\nThe energy index, meanwhile, increased 2.6% for the 12 months ending April, according to the Labor Department's latest figures.\n\n\"Among the remaining concerns, energy prices are receding since oil prices peaked in early April and will likely act disinflationary in the coming months,\" Wurm said.\n\n\"In a similar vein, remaining price pressures in service industries will fade as US labor markets have come more in balance, and wage growth, while still elevated, will slowly recede,\" he added.\n\nIn May, average hourly earnings for all employees on private non-farm payrolls increased by 0.4% compared to April, according to Labor Department figures released Friday.\n\nThat figure showed an annual increase of 4.1% compared to the same month of 2023.\n\nThose figures also accelerated from April, when average hourly earnings showed a monthly gain of 0.2% and increased 3.9% year-on-year.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moody's_Analytics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moody's Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disinflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_versus_nominal_value_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real versus nominal value (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tertiary sector of the economy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Action_Figures", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Action Figures", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management Relations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2024/06/12/thumbs_b_c_171d6f951fded7e4aa58394a95260bc9.jpg?v=121207", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-18", "textStart": 2120, "textEnd": 2128}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 2771, "textEnd": 2777}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Such an outcome is likely to add to the case for the Bank of England to avoid a rate cut this month.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiff_Macklem", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiff Macklem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-110853520,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-486280,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

This is the first interest rate cut since September 2019.\n\nMore specifically, the European Central Bank cut the key deposit rate to 3.75% from 4%, marking the start of the downward cycle.\n\nRecall that in 14 months, interest rates had risen 10 times, reaching record levels, and for a further 9 months, they had remained unchanged.\n\nAt the same time, it is the first time in recent years that the European Central Bank has cut rates before the US Fed has cut its own dollar rates.\n\nRelaxing announcements on the European Central Bank's rationale are expected to be made by Christine Lagarde in a few hours.\n\nToday's cut marks the end to the interest rate hikes that began after the pandemic as inflation soared. However, investors' attention seems to have already begun to turn to what will happen in the next few sessions.\n\nEurozone inflation in May was slightly higher at 2.6%. In addition, negotiated wage growth accelerated again in the first quarter to 4.7% after 4.5% in Q4 2023.\n\nAlthough a new rate cut in July cannot be ruled out, given recent comments from ECB policymakers, it does not seem very likely.\n\nThe ECB statement\n\nThe Governing Council decided today to cut the ECB's three key interest rates by 25 basis points. In line with the updated assessment of the outlook for inflation, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the intensity with which monetary policy is transmitted, it now seems appropriate to moderate the degree of contractionary change in monetary policy after nine months of keeping interest rates fixed.\n\nSince the September 2023 Board meeting, inflation has declined by more than 2.5 percentage points and the outlook for inflation has improved significantly.\n\nUnderlying inflation has also eased, reinforcing evidence that price pressures have eased, and inflation expectations have declined at all horizons. Monetary policy has kept financing conditions restrictive. The moderation in demand and the stabilisation of inflation expectations have made a significant contribution to bringing inflation back to lower levels.\n\nAt the same time, despite progress in recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as the pace of wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to remain above target for much of next year as well.\n\nThe Eurosystem's most recent expert projections for headline and core inflation have been revised upwards for 2024 and 2025 compared with the March projections. The experts now expect headline inflation to average 2.5% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. As for inflation excluding energy and food, they forecast it to average 2.8% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025 and 2.0% in 2026. Economic growth is expected to accelerate to 0.9% in 2024, 1.4% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026.\n\nThe Board is committed to ensuring that inflation returns to its medium-term target of 2% in time. It will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as deemed necessary to achieve this target.\n\nSee Also\n\nTasos Birsim: The Mastermind Behind Andreas Papandreou's Electoral Campaigns Has Passed Away\n\nThe Governing Council will continue to follow an evidence-based approach and take decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis to determine the appropriate size and duration of the contractionary change in monetary policy.\n\nIn particular, its decisions on interest rates will be based on its assessment of the outlook for inflation in light of incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the intensity with which monetary policy is transmitted. The Board is not committed in advance to a specific path for interest rates.\n\nThe Governing Council also confirmed today that it will reduce the securities held by the Eurosystem under the Pandemic Exceptional Asset Purchase Programme (PEPP) by an average of EUR 7.5 billion per month in the second half of this year. The detailed terms of this reduction will be broadly similar to those applicable to the asset purchase programme (APP).\n\n- European Central Bank cuts interest rates for the first time since 2019 appeared first on ProtoThema English.", "source": {"uri": "sofokleous10.gr", "dataType": "news", "title": "sofokleous10.gr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christine Lagarde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eurosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/sofokleous10.gr/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2392938-european-central-bank-cuts-interest-rates-for-the-first-time-since-2019.png?fit=797%2C446&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-09-", "textStart": 124, "textEnd": 138}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

The downgrade in their outlook for rate cuts would mean that such borrowing costs would likely stay higher for longer, a disappointment for potential homebuyers and others.\n\nStill, the Fed's quarterly projections of future interest rate cuts are by no means fixed in time. The policymakers frequently revise their plans for rate cuts -- or hikes -- depending on how economic growth and inflation measures evolve over time.\n\nBut if borrowing costs remain high in the coming months, they could also have consequences for the presidential race. Though the unemployment rate is a low 4%, hiring is robust and consumers continue to spend, voters have taken a generally sour view of the economy under President Joe Biden. In large part, that's because prices remain much higher than they were before the pandemic struck. High borrowing rates impose a further financial burden.\n\nThe Fed's updated economic forecasts, which it will issue Wednesday afternoon, will likely be influenced by the government's May inflation data being released in the morning.

However, the key focus this week is on the Fed's updated economic projections and Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, where recent disappointing growth indicators could lead to a more dovish tone.\n\nMarkets are intently watching the upcoming US inflation data, with economists expecting headline consumer price inflation to ease to 0.1% from 0.3%. Core price inflation is anticipated to remain steady at 0.3%. The Fed is likely to maintain current rates, but their updated 'dot plot' may signal only two rate cuts in 2024 instead of three, impacting market sentiment and investment strategies.\n\nThe bigger picture: Global economic balancing act.\n\nAcross the globe, central banks are grappling with the balance of supporting growth while managing inflation.

Rates Will Hold Steady but 'Dot Plot' Forecasts Could Change.\n\nJune 12 will be a big day for advancing the macroeconomic narrative that has buffeted stock and bond markets this year. May inflation data will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee will publish an interest-rate decision and officials' economic forecasts for the years ahead at 2 p.m. ET.\n\nMarkets are overwhelmingly pricing in no change in interest rates, and Fed officials' public comments have largely closed the door on cuts before this fall, at the earliest. That doesn't mean there won't be market-moving news on Wednesday.\n\nAs is often the case, the focus will be on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's post-meeting press conference and officials' updated Summary of Economic Projections, or the so-called Dot Plot. That's a quarterly collection of forecasts for the economy, inflation, the labor market, and interest rates offered by the seven Fed governors and 12 regional Fed presidents.\n\nPowell is likely to stick to the message he delivered at his May 1 post-meeting press conference: The Federal Open Market Committee is on hold with regard to interest-rate cuts until officials gain greater confidence that inflation is sustainably trending toward a 2% annual rate. The release of the May CPI is unlikely to supply that confidence.\n\nEconomists' consensus forecast calls for a 0.1% increase in inflation in May, which would be good for a year-over-year increase of 3.4% -- unchanged from a month earlier. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy components, is seen rising 0.3% last month and 3.5% from a year ago. That annual increase would be a tenth of a percentage point less than in April, but still well above the Fed's 2% annual inflation target.\n\nIn short, the latest CPI report is likely to confirm the largely lateral movement in inflation indexes so far in 2024 -- keeping changes in interest rates off the table for the time being. The FOMC has held its federal-funds rate target range at 5.25% to 5.5% since June 2023.\n\nThe median forecast in the latest SEP, in March, called for a fed-funds rate target by the end of 2024 that implies three quarter-point cuts this year.

For the 12-month period ending in May, the price of goods and services increased by 3.3%, according to government data. The new inflation data was released Wednesday by the government's Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThe inflation rate was 3.4% for the 12-month period ending in April and 3.5% for the year ending in March. The consumer price index weighs the costs of goods based on their importance. Items like food, shelter and energy tend to be weighted more heavily.\n\nThe good news for consumers is that inflation for food purchased at grocery stores is low. In the 12 months ending in May, food meant to be consumed at home was 1% higher. Just a few years ago, annual food inflation topped 10%. This slowing of food inflation comes as major chains, such as Walgreens and Target, have announced price rollbacks on numerous items.\n\nCompany News\n\nMcDonald's president responds to reports of $18 Big Mac meals Justin Boggs 7:11 AM, May 30, 2024\n\nDining out continues to be a more expensive proposition as eating away from the home costs 4% more this year than last, the BLS said.

Shelter was 5.4% higher in May 2024 than a year earlier.\n\nMay marked 13 consecutive months with a consumer price index between 3% and 4%. With inflation failing to drop below 3%, the Federal Reserve has continued to keep interest rates at a five-decade high since late 2023.

A rally in Treasuries sent two-year yields down as much as 17 basis points as the US dollar dropped against all of its developed-world peers. Fed swaps now fully price in quarter-point rate cuts in November and December -- and bets on a September reduction also rose.\n\nIn the run-up to the Fed decision, data showed the core consumer price index cooled to the slowest pace in more than three years. The figures may represent the early stages of inflation resuming a downward trend that would allow officials to cut rates.\n\n\"This report is exactly what the Fed needed to increase its confidence that inflation is subsiding and rate cuts are warranted in the months ahead,\" said Ronald Temple at Lazard. \"A September rate cut is very much back in play.\"\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to hold its benchmark rate steady for a seventh consecutive meeting Wednesday. The rate decision and projections will be released at 2 p.m. in Washington. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference 30 minutes later.\n\nEquities extended their bull run, with the S&P 500 now up 14% this year. Big tech is consolidating its leadership, with Tesla Inc., Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. rallying at least 4% Wednesday. Gains were also fueled by blowout earnings from Oracle Corp., which soared 12%. Lower bond rates also helped, with two-year yields set for their biggest slide since December. The euro rose 1%.\n\nWhile the CPI data spurred a sigh of relief on Wall Street, policymakers have stressed that they'd need to see several months of price pressures receding before they consider lowering interest rates, especially with the latest solid jobs report.\n\nTo Krishna Guha at Evercore, the CPI data starts the clock on a potential September rate cut, but the Fed will need to see much more sustained progress to deliver that reduction, and will try to underline that point at its June meeting - something markets should be prepared for.\n\n\"Powell is still very concerned about the employment report,\" said Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities. \"And he is not your typical Fed governor who would want to take the 'punchbowl off the table', so we may have more legs. But the risk-reward is getting narrower.\"\n\nChris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley says \"the story isn't over\" after CPI as the Fed has said it wants to see an established trend of falling inflation.\n\n\"A September cut is still in play -- as long as we get more numbers like this one.\"\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee, which has held its benchmark rate at a two-decade high since July, was encouraged by a sharp decline in inflation in the second half of 2023 to pencil in a gradual reduction in rates this year. In March, the quarterly \"dot plot\" signaled three quarter-point cuts in 2024. But most recently bets had been mounting on fewer reductions.\n\n\"Altogether, this report probably shifts the focus back to two or three rate cuts in 2024,\" said Jason Pride at Glenmede.\n\nTo Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets, the softer read on inflation clears the path for the \"dot plot\" to signal 50 basis points of cuts this year.\n\n\"The Fed's last mile toward price stability is getting shorter,\" said Quincy Krosby at LPL Financial. \"This should help the FOMC, today preparing its dot plot and fine tuning its statement, offer a more positive view regarding monetary easing despite invoking their well-practiced reminder that they remain data dependent and require additional confirmation that inflation continues to trend lower.\"\n\nDavid Russell at TradeStation notes that inflation is slowing even as the economy accelerates.\n\n\"Things are playing out as the Fed hoped, so Jerome Powell will probably be feeling good this afternoon,\" he said. \"September could be back in play for a rate cut. The bears have nowhere to run to and nowhere to hide.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 is in its 12th bull market since 1955, according to Jim Paulsen, a retired well-known stock bull on Wall Street and author of the \"Paulsen Perspectives\" newsletter. Before its latest run to all-time highs, the fed funds rate was reduced prior to the start of every bull run -- except once when the first cut occurred concurrently with the start of a bull in 1966.\n\nIn the prior 11 bull markets, borrowing costs were trimmed anywhere from 0 to 27 months before a new bull started, with an average lead time of 9.5 months, he said. That means Fed officials typically provided a supportive rate policy months before a new bull market emerged and kept cutting borrowing costs long after a new bull was in process.\n\nThis story was

Now, it seems there's hope for just one cut this year, according to the latest projections from the FOMC.\n\nSince President Joe Biden took office, the Fed has raised interest rates to the highest level since early 2001 in its faltering attempt to wrangle inflation down to a goal of just 2.0 percent. According to the May Consumer Price Index (CPI) report released earlier on Wednesday, the last 12 months saw inflation rise 3.3 percent.\n\nAs usual, the FOMC said the following about its future interest rate decisions:\n\nIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\n\nIn remarks Wednesday afternoon, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated his belief that it would not be appropriate to reduce interest rates until there's more confidence that there's been progress toward reducing inflation -- a refutation of President Biden's claims that inflation is already coming down.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "spencer_brown@townhall.com", "name": "Spencer Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Committees", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Committees", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2023/81/3b4d3d8f-eea4-43a9-a389-5a8a03d91c02.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "-01-04", "dateEnd": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 299, "textEnd": 309}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

The interest rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee has been meeting for two days, to debate whether or not to lower interest rates.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will address the media later in the day.

That is the lowest annual increase in core prices since April 2021.\n\nCompared to the prior month, the broad measure of consumer prices was unchanged. Core prices increased by 0.2 percent.\n\nEconomists had forecast that the broad measure would show prices rising 3.4 percent over the past year and one-tenth of a percentage point compared to the prior month. The core measure was expected to rise 3.5 percent annually and 0.3 percent for the month.\n\nIn April, inflation cooled slightly after three consecutive months of rapid price hikes that unsettled investors and alarmed Federal Reserve policymakers. This cooling eased fears of a sustained acceleration in inflation.\n\nAfter a decade of minimal price pressure, inflation surged shortly after President Biden took office and enacted a large deficit spending bill known as the American Rescue Plan. The expansive fiscal policy coincided with an accommodative monetary policy, with interest rates near zero, and supply chain disruptions caused by pandemic fallout and geopolitical strife. This combination drove demand up faster than the economy could accommodate.\n\nThe impact of Biden's policies on inflation, dubbed \"Bidenflation,\" has led to significant public dissatisfaction with his economic leadership and historically low approval ratings. Despite low unemployment, persistent economic growth, and a booming stock market, most measures of consumer and small business sentiment remain at depressed levels.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, concluding its two-day meeting later on Wednesday, is widely expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady at a range of 5.25 to 5.50 percent. Before the surge in inflation earlier this year, the Fed was expected to cut rates several times in 2024, with forecasts indicating three rate cuts. Now, the Fed is anticipated to implement only one or two rate cuts this year.\n\nIn the minutes after the meeting, prices in the federal funds futures market indicated that investors are nearly certain that the Fed's benchmark will be lower after its November meeting and that there is around a 70 percent chance of a cut at the September meeting.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_carney@breitbart.com", "name": "John Carney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Rescue_Plan_Act_of_2021", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Rescue Plan Act of 2021"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deficit_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deficit spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_exchange", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Futures exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Small business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Family_and_Consumer_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Family and Consumer Science", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/06/jerome-powell-2017-arms-crossed-ap.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

It's expected to show headline inflation of 3.4%, matching April's annual gain in prices, according to estimates from Bloomberg.\n\nOver the prior month, consumer prices are expected to have risen 0.1%, a deceleration from April's 0.3% month-over-month increase. That would also be the smallest month-over-month rise since October 2023.\n\nA decline in energy prices will likely contribute to further downward pressure on headline CPI, according to Bank of America.\n\n\"Energy prices likely fell in May on a seasonally adjusted basis owing to a decline in gasoline prices. This likely was a relief for consumers after gas prices had increased in April and March,\" BofA economists Stephen Juneau and Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients last week. \"With crude prices moving lower, gas prices are likely to continue to decline in the near-term.\"\n\nOn a \"core\" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in May are expected to have risen 3.5% over last year -- a slight slowdown from the 3.6% annual increase seen in April, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nCore prices are expected to have climbed 0.3% month over month in May, matching April.\n\nCore inflation has remained stubbornly elevated due to higher costs of shelter and core services like insurance and medical care. But BofA expects those categories \"to make a very small step in the right direction.\"\n\n\"Shelter inflation was likely a little firmer this month owing to an increase in lodging away from home prices,\" said Juneau and Gapen. \"However, core services ex shelter should show some moderation as we look for softer increases in several service categories.\"\n\nOver time, the economists said they \"expect to see more notable progress on services inflation,\" thanks to moderations in motor vehicle insurance, rent, and owners' equivalent rent. Owners' equivalent rent is the hypothetical rent a homeowner would pay for the same property.\n\nThe team at Goldman Sachs, led by Jan Hatzius, agreed \"further disinflation\" remains in the pipeline this year, citing \"rebalancing in the auto, housing rental, and labor markets.\"\n\nStill, \"we expect offsets from catch-up inflation in healthcare and car insurance and from single-family rent growth continuing to outpace multifamily rent growth.\"\n\nGoldman anticipates year-over-year core CPI inflation of 3.5% and core PCE inflation of 2.8% in December 2024.\n\nInflation has remained stubbornly above the Federal Reserve's 2% target on an annual basis. And even though this CPI report won't have an outsized effect on the looming Fed decision, the timing has perhaps added even more spectacle around its release.\n\nFed officials have categorized the path down to 2% as \"bumpy,\" while other recent economic data has fueled the Fed's higher-for-longer narrative on the path of interest rates.\n\nOn Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed the labor market added 272,000 nonfarm payroll jobs last month, significantly more additions than the 180,000 expected by economists. Wages also came in ahead of estimates at 4.1%, although the unemployment rate rose slightly to 4% from 3.9%.\n\nNotably, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the so-called core PCE price index, has remained particularly sticky. The year-over-year change in core PCE, closely watched by the Fed, held steady at 2.8% for the month of April, matching March.\n\n\"If the report is in line with our expectations, we would maintain our expectation for the Fed to cut one time this year in December,\" BofA said. \"We feel it is unlikely that inflation data will soften enough over the coming months to enable the Fed to cut before December.

In March, the Fed forecasted three 25 basis point rate cuts for 2024, aiming for a final policy rate in the 3.75%-4% range. Now, expectations have shifted, with only one cut envisioned for this year and a more gradual descent to a 4.1% rate by the end of 2025. This adjustment responds directly to higher-than-anticipated inflation figures, with personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation hitting 2.7% recently, and fourth-quarter forecasts raised to 2.6%. Core PCE inflation projections have likewise increased. These corrections underscore the complexity of achieving the Fed's 2% inflation target amidst current economic conditions.\n\nInvestors should watch how the Fed's cautious stance influences market expectations and bond yields. The revised rate forecast may temper bullish market sentiment seen earlier this year. Stock markets could remain volatile as sectors sensitive to interest rates, such as real estate and utilities, react to these policy shifts.\n\nThe bigger picture: Strategic inflation management.\n\nGlobally, central banks are battling inflation while balancing economic growth. The Fed's updated forecast mirrors a broader trend of adjusting monetary policies in response to evolving inflation dynamics.

Powell is expected to emphasize the need for more data confirming that inflation is trending towards the Fed's 2% target before implementing any rate reductions.\n\nThe strong job market, evident in recent employment figures, supports the Fed's decision to hold rates steady. This contrasts with other central banks, such as the European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada, which have already begun lowering borrowing costs.\n\nWall Street speculates that the first rate cut could occur in September, with potential hints from Powell at the Jackson Hole economic symposium in August. There is broad consensus among Fed officials that current interest rates are adequate, and a steady approach is prudent given the economy's resilience.\n\nWhile the US economy remains healthy, many Americans face financial pressure from high interest rates, persistent inflation, rising debt, and dwindling pandemic savings. Consumer spending has slowed, and retailers report changes in purchasing behavior.\n\nThe Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 2.7% annually in April. Despite a significant drop from the previous year, inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target.

In April, prices rose 3.4%.\n\nCore prices that exclude volatile food and energy items rose 0.2% in May, the mildest increase since last July, and were up 3.4% from a year ago, the smallest year-over-year rise since 2021. The closely watched measure of inflation was much softer than economists predicted.\n\nWednesday's report keeps alive the prospect that the Fed might be able to cut interest rates at its September meeting. Officials have said they are looking to regain confidence that price growth is slowing after several disappointing figures at the beginning of the year.\n\nStock futures jumped after the report, while Treasury yields fell. Futures markets on Wednesday priced in a roughly 70% chance of at least two rate cuts by year's end, according to CME Group, up from 52% Tuesday.\n\nWednesday's inflation report, which came hours before a Fed meeting is set to conclude, was better than many investors' expectations.\n\nAmericans in May paid less for transportation than the previous month, while price hikes for medical care services also tapered. Prices at the pump fell despite summer driving season kicking into high gear.\n\nThe cost of apparel and dairy products declined in May as some major retailers began cutting prices for thousands of products. Walmart executives said last month that grocery rollbacks were up 45% from a year earlier, while Target unveiled new or coming discounts for items ranging from peanut butter to paper towels.\n\nEconomists and investors have eagerly awaited the report for a fresh glimpse into when the Federal Reserve may begin easing monetary policy that shapes mortgage rates, credit card interest and other borrowing costs across the economy.\n\nFew on Wall Street or in Washington believe the central bank will cut rates at the meeting that concludes Wednesday or a subsequent meeting in July.\n\nBut a well-behaved May inflation report was a likely prerequisite for the Fed to consider lowering interest rates after that, as officials have said they want to see a series of readings that rebuilds their confidence inflation will head lower. A hot reading, on the other hand, would have complicated efforts to cut rates without evidence of economic weakness.\n\nInvestors are betting that less restrictive policy will provide more fuel to an artificial-intelligence-focused stock market that has already powered through the highest rates in more than two decades. It may also release a pressure valve for consumers who have faced higher costs to take out loans as well as persistent price hikes.\n\nAfter inflation held stubbornly high to start 2024, a string of data in recent weeks suggested that the world's largest economy has resumed its gradual slowdown without painful ruptures to the labor market. Many domestic companies are muscling ahead of foreign counterparts. The U.S. unemployment rate has been 4% or lower for 30 consecutive months. Wage gains continue.\n\nEven so, many Americans are gloomy about the state of the economy, thanks largely to the cumulative toll of yearslong price pressures.\n\nAmericans' short-term inflation expectations ticked lower in May, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, while more households grew optimistic about their financial situations.

The decision came hours after new government data showed inflation eased slightly last month.\n\nFOMC members' latest median economic projections showed that the federal funds rate would be cut to 5.1 percent at the end of this year, down from their March forecast of 4.6 percent. The latest projection signaled one cut this year, two fewer than previously expected.\n\nAhead of the decision, the U.S. Labor Department said in a new report that the consumer price index, a key gauge of inflation, rose 3.3 percent on a yearly basis in May -- a smaller increase than the 3.4 percent rise in April. The latest reading is slightly below economists' forecast of 3.4 percent.\n\nPolicymakers have been seeking evidence that inflation is on a convincingly sustainable path to its inflation target of 2 percent as they are trying to find the right timing to begin rate cuts.\n\nThe U.S. key rate has remained unchanged since a quarter percentage point increase to the current level in July.

A rally in Treasuries sent two-year yields down as much as 17 basis points as the US dollar dropped against all of its developed-world peers. Fed swaps now fully price in quarter-point rate cuts in November and December -- and bets on a September reduction also rose.\n\nIn the run-up to the Fed decision, data showed the core consumer price index cooled to the slowest pace in more than three years. The figures may represent the early stages of inflation resuming a downward trend that would allow officials to cut rates.\n\n\"This report is exactly what the Fed needed to increase its confidence that inflation is subsiding and rate cuts are warranted in the months ahead,\" said Ronald Temple at Lazard. \"A September rate cut is very much back in play.\"\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to hold its benchmark rate steady for a seventh consecutive meeting Wednesday. The rate decision and projections will be released at 2 p.m. in Washington. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference 30 minutes later.\n\nEquities extended their bull run, with the S&P 500 now up 14% this year. Big tech is consolidating its leadership, with Tesla Inc., Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. rallying at least 4% Wednesday. Gains were also fueled by blowout earnings from Oracle Corp., which soared 12%. Lower bond rates also helped, with two-year yields set for their biggest slide since December. The euro rose 1%.\n\nWhile the CPI data spurred a sigh of relief on Wall Street, policymakers have stressed that they'd need to see several months of price pressures receding before they consider lowering interest rates, especially with the latest solid jobs report.\n\nTo Krishna Guha at Evercore, the CPI data starts the clock on a potential September rate cut, but the Fed will need to see much more sustained progress to deliver that reduction, and will try to underline that point at its June meeting - something markets should be prepared for.\n\n\"Powell is still very concerned about the employment report,\" said Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities. \"And he is not your typical Fed governor who would want to take the 'punchbowl off the table', so we may have more legs. But the risk-reward is getting narrower.\"\n\nChris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley says \"the story isn't over\" after CPI as the Fed has said it wants to see an established trend of falling inflation.\n\n\"A September cut is still in play -- as long as we get more numbers like this one.\"\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee, which has held its benchmark rate at a two-decade high since July, was encouraged by a sharp decline in inflation in the second half of 2023 to pencil in a gradual reduction in rates this year. In March, the quarterly \"dot plot\" signaled three quarter-point cuts in 2024. But most recently bets had been mounting on fewer reductions.\n\n\"Altogether, this report probably shifts the focus back to two or three rate cuts in 2024,\" said Jason Pride at Glenmede.\n\nTo Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets, the softer read on inflation clears the path for the \"dot plot\" to signal 50 basis points of cuts this year.\n\n\"The Fed's last mile toward price stability is getting shorter,\" said Quincy Krosby at LPL Financial. \"This should help the FOMC, today preparing its dot plot and fine tuning its statement, offer a more positive view regarding monetary easing despite invoking their well-practiced reminder that they remain data dependent and require additional confirmation that inflation continues to trend lower.\"\n\nDavid Russell at TradeStation notes that inflation is slowing even as the economy accelerates.\n\n\"Things are playing out as the Fed hoped, so Jerome Powell will probably be feeling good this afternoon,\" he said. \"September could be back in play for a rate cut. The bears have nowhere to run to and nowhere to hide.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 is in its 12th bull market since 1955, according to Jim Paulsen, a retired well-known stock bull on Wall Street and author of the \"Paulsen Perspectives\" newsletter. Before its latest run to all-time highs, the fed funds rate was reduced prior to the start of every bull run -- except once when the first cut occurred concurrently with the start of a bull in 1966.\n\nIn the prior 11 bull markets, borrowing costs were trimmed anywhere from 0 to 27 months before a new bull started, with an average lead time of 9.5 months, he said. That means Fed officials typically provided a supportive rate policy months before a new bull market emerged and kept cutting borrowing costs long after a new bull was in process.\n\nCorporate Highlights:\n\nKey events this week:\n\nSome of the main moves in markets:\n\nStocks\n\nCurrencies\n\nCryptocurrencies\n\nBonds\n\nCommodities\n\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n\nThis article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.\n\nMilestone Alert!

The new dot plot likely will indicate two 25-basis-point cuts this year, compared with three in the March version.\n\nWith growth indicators consistently surprising to the downside since the April 30-May 1 meeting -- even as inflation data have met expectations -- we expect Powell to sound relatively dovish in his news conference.\"\n\n-- Anna Wong, chief US economist. For full analysis, click here\n\nInflation by the Fed's preferred measure was 2.7% in the year ended April, compared to the central bank's 2% target. Data released Friday showed a surge in payrolls last month as well as accelerating wages, prompting traders to dial back expectations on rate cuts this year.\n\n\"The Fed will opt to keep rates steady for longer,\" said Thomas Simons, senior US economist at Jefferies. \"They will want to see a renewed run of more favorable data in line with an inflation trend closer to 2% before they feel comfortable cutting rates.\"\n\nIn Canada, fresh from becoming the first central banker in the Group of Seven to launch into an easing cycle, Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem will speak at a conference in Montreal.\n\nElsewhere, a Bank of Japan decision that may pare back bond buying, inflation data from China to Sweden, and crucial UK wage numbers will be among the week's highlights.\n\nClick here for what happened last week and below is our wrap of what is coming up in the global economy.\n\nAsia\n\nThe BOJ grabs the spotlight Friday when its board concludes a two-day meeting with a policy decision.\n\nWhile the bank is expected to hold its short-term rate steady, people familiar with the matter have said officials may discuss whether to reduce bond purchases.\n\nThat's a step that could support the yen if Japan's long-term interest rates nudge higher, narrowing the yield differential with US Treasuries.\n\nThe BOJ meets after the government releases revised growth data for the first quarter on Monday that are likely to confirm the economy contracted for a second time in three quarters.\n\nElsewhere, the State Bank of Pakistan is seen cutting its benchmark rate by a full percentage point on Monday after consumer inflation slowed considerably in May. Central banks in Thailand and Taiwan also meet this week.\n\nIn data, China's consumer inflation is projected to accelerate a tad to 0.4% year on year in May, while factory-gate deflation may slow to 1.5%, the smallest drop in prices since February 2023.\n\nIndia also gets price statistics along with industrial production, while Malaysia publishes April manufacturing sales value and industrial output.\n\nTrade numbers are due from the Philippines and India, and Australia releases NAB business conditions and confidence figures Tuesday, followed by a raft of labor data on Thursday.\n\nEurope, Middle East, Africa\n\nThe UK offer some data highlights in the coming week. On Tuesday, labor-market numbers may show an uptick in pay growth in the three months through April, with an annual 6.1% increase anticipated by economists. Such an outcome is likely to add to the case for the Bank of England to avoid a rate cut this month.\n\nIn numbers on Wednesday meanwhile, gross domestic product probably failed to rise in April for the first time this year, with both manufacturing and services expected to have suffered declines on the month that signaled a poor start to the second quarter.\n\nWith the UK election campaign in full swing, BOE officials will keep to a self-imposed quiet period in coming days.\n\nOver in the euro zone, industrial production data on Monday is anticipated to show the smallest increase in three months, suggesting that the region also began the second quarter on a weak footing.\n\nIn the wake of their rate cut last week, European Central Bank officials scheduled to speak this week include governors from Germany and France, Chief Economist Philip Lane, Vice President Luis de Guindos and ECB President Christine Lagarde.\n\nInvestors will also have an eye on European Parliament elections, results of which are set to be published late on Sunday.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says...\n\n\"In the next parliament, the EU will have to take action to tackle the productivity gap that has opened up with the US economy -- failing to do so would put its position as a major global player at risk. It must strike a balance between fiscal sustainability and investing for a greener, more prosperous future. And it will have to decide where it stands on trade policy and defense at a moment of extreme geopolitical uncertainty.\"\n\n-- Jamie Rush and Simona Delle Chiaie. Read the full research here\n\nLooking south, Saudi Arabian GDP data on Sunday will give an updated view after an initial estimate that the kingdom's economy shrank 1.8% in the first three months of the year, the third consecutive quarterly contraction.\n\nThe non-oil economy -- a priority for the government -- grew by 2.8% year-on-year during the first quarter, also easing from higher levels during previous quarters.\n\nOn Thursday Kenya's Treasury Secretary Njuguna Ndung'u will deliver the East African nation's budget for the year through June 2025. He's expected to elaborate on plans for the country at high risk of debt distress to achieve its lowest fiscal deficit in 15 years by containing spending, trimming borrowing and aggressive tax measures.\n\nMeanwhile several consumer-price reports for May will be published throughout the wider region:\n\nLatin America\n\nIn Brazil, the central bank's survey of analysts posted Monday may show further erosion of inflation expectations for 2024-2026 as well as the May reading.\n\nNotably, analysts last week raised their 2024 estimate for the key rate by a quarter point to 10.25% -- up from 9% in April -- adding to speculation that the bank will hold at 10.5% this month.\n\nThe May consumer prices report out Tuesday will likely show the first acceleration in eight months from April's 3.69%. On Thursday, Brazil's statistics agency posts April retail sales data.\n\nIn Colombia, the early consensus expects that inflation ticked up ever so slightly in May, its first move up in 14 month. Also on the schedule are April reports on industrial production, manufacturing and retail sales.\n\nArgentina's monthly inflation likely slowed for a fifth month in May from 8.8% in April. Analysts surveyed by the central bank see a 5.2% print, implying an annual rate of 279.6%, down from April's 289.4% reading.\n\nIn Peru, one of the world's longest serving central bankers has finally gotten inflation back to target: Julio Velarde, who has helmed the bank for almost 18 years, goes into Thursday's rate meeting with consumer prices back at the 2% target. Look for a quarter-point cut to 5.5%.\n\n--With assistance from Tony Halpin, Robert Jameson, Laura Dhillon Kane, Brian Fowler, Piotr Skolimowski, Monique Vanek, David Herbling and Abeer Abu Omar.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Prices rose 3.3% over the year, slightly lower than the year-over-year rate in April. Both numbers were better than the consensus expectation from economists surveyed by the Dow Jones Newswires and the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThis report could help ease fears that inflation is flaring up again after price increases were surprisingly elevated in the first quarter. Instead, prices have continued their descent, falling significantly from the 41-year peak hit in June 2022, when the CPI was up 9.1% over the previous 12 months.\n\nFederal Reserve's officials meet later today and have repeatedly said they're looking for economic data -- especially inflation reports -- to show that consumer prices are firmly on the path down to an annual 2% inflation rate before they'll decide to cut interest rates. The central bank has maintained its key fed funds rate at a 23-year high since last July, pushing up borrowing costs for mortgages and other loans, in hopes of slowing the economy and stifling inflation.\n\nBefore the report, traders were pricing in July 8.9% chance of a rate cut in July and 54.4% in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, which forecasts rate movements based on fed funds futures trading data. About 15 minutes after the data was released, those numbers jumped to 14.5% and 70.3% respectively.", "source": {"uri": "investopedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investopedia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones & Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/ahsg4_DEjDzWE3FJ5XJxhXMB4xs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-1762388455-badcfbf5b76442eab3986748639f3803.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-08", "textStart": 1462, "textEnd": 1468}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Investors, confident that rates would remain unchanged, focused on the details of the announcement and the members' three-year average interest rate forecasts. So, what were the decisions, and where will the market move now?\n\nJune 12 Fed Interest Rate Decision\n\nBitcoin, gold, the dollar, silver, and all markets were keenly awaiting today's news from the Fed. At the beginning of the year, members who predicted a 75bp cut by year-end opposed the market's 150bp rate cut scenario. However, poor inflation data in the first quarter and fluctuating signals from the employment front caused these expectations to drop to 50bp levels. Access NEWSLINKER to get the latest technology news.\n\nNow, signals about whether the Fed will make its first cut in September or earlier were sought in these statements. Last month, after some members commented that the cut might be delayed or even require a bit more tightening, investors experienced days of emotional turmoil. Meanwhile, the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank made their first rate cuts by 25bp.\n\nHalf an hour later, Powell will make important statements, and here are the key summary points you need to know about today's interest rate decision:\n\nFed kept interest rates unchanged. Fed doesn't find it appropriate to reduce the policy target range until inflation sustainably moves towards 2%. Fed members' median interest rate forecast for the end of 2024 is 5.1% (previously 4.6%). Fed: Inflation has decreased but remains high. Fed: Risks towards achieving policy goals have moved towards a better balance. Fed: The economy continues to grow at a solid pace, employment increases are strong, and the unemployment rate remains low. Fed projections foresee a 25 basis point rate cut from the current level in 2024 and a 100 basis point cut in 2025. Fed: We will continue to reduce our holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities. According to Fed projections, 4 out of 19 officials do not foresee a rate cut in 2024, while 7 foresee one cut, and 8 foresee two cuts. Fed members revised the 2024 year-end PCE from 2.4% to 2.6% and core inflation from 2.6% to 2.8%. The 2025 PCE and core PCE inflation were revised from 2.2% to 2.3% according to March member forecasts. Fed members see GDP growth at 2.1% and the unemployment rate at 4% in 2024; both unchanged from March. Fed: We don't find it appropriate to reduce the policy target range until inflation sustainably moves towards 2%.

Wall Street expects the latest Fed \"dot-plot\" to pencil in two rate cuts before the end of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a news conference at 2:30 p.m.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose sharply to fresh record highs ahead of the Fed announcement. The market is in strong record territory following tame May consumer price index data.\n\nThe message from markets is that there's nothing to fear from today's Fed meeting, and that's probably right. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who will take to the podium at 2:30 p.m., has to be pleased by the cooling in inflation, especially services inflation.\n\nPowell has held together a narrow majority of Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, members behind a cautiously dovish policy. The last batch of projections in March indicated that 10 committee members were forecasting three quarter-point cuts, while nine members saw two rate cuts or fewer.\n\nThe new projections are likely to show a similarly narrow majority backing two rate hikes. However, May's 0.16% rise in the core CPI, the smallest monthly increase since August 2021, could signal the renewal of a disinflationary trend and help build a consensus. Still, Powell will make it clear that one inflation report isn't nearly enough to give the Fed the confidence it needs to start cutting rates.\n\nAhead of the Fed update, markets are pricing in 73% odds of a quarter-point rate cut on Sept. 18, up from around 50% before the CPI.

Prices on food purchased away from home also moved up .4% last month and are 4% higher than this time last year. Grocery prices held steady on a monthly basis in May and were 1% more expensive than 12 months ago.\n\nCore CPI, a measure that excludes volatile food and energy prices, ticked up .2% from April to May, finishing the month at 3.4%.\n\nHelping to offset still-hot inflationary pressures in some areas of consumer spending were easing costs for gasoline, which dropped 3.6% from April to May and were 2.2% higher than this time last year and a 2% decline in overall energy prices on a monthly basis.\n\nThe May measures for both overall inflation and core inflation came in lower than most economists were expecting.\n\n\"Finally, some positive surprises as both headline and core inflation beat forecasts,\" Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union, told CNBC. \"There was relief at the pump, but unfortunately home and apartment costs continue to rise and remain the main cause of inflation. Until those shelter costs begin their long-awaited fall, we won't see major drops in CPI.\"\n\nThe new data arrives on the same day the Federal Reserve's rate-setting Open Market Committee wraps up its June meeting. The committee is expected to stand pat on its current federal funds range rate of 5.25% to 5.5%, but the May inflation data is likely to drive further optimism about a downward rate adjustment coming as early as September.\n\nThe CPI reading follows the latest Personal Consumption Expenditure report from the U.S. Department of Commerce, released late last month, that found inflation still inched up from March to April but was the smallest monthly increase so far this year and annual inflation held steady.\n\nThe core PCE index is the Fed's preferred metric when it comes to how the monetary body assesses inflationary impacts.\n\nNear the end of last year, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was sounding optimistic about the direction of the U.S. economy and signaled 2024 could see a series of downward adjustments to the monetary body's benchmark federal funds rate.\n\nBut that rosy glow faded somewhat as the first months of the year saw inflation bucking a steady downward trend that was in play for most of 2023 and was instead back on the rise.\n\nAnd at the conclusion of the Fed's May policy meeting, Powell said that inflationary persistence helped push the body's Open Market Committee to support the pause on adjusting a rate range that has been in play since last July and is the highest in over 20 years.\n\nMost economists expect the Fed's rate-setting body will continue to hold on current rates at the conclusion of its two-day meeting Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Sign up to watch, and learn, with us.\n\nThe consumer price index for May clocked inflation at 3.3% annually, a slight cooling of the inflation rate in April. On a monthly basis, prices were flat, which cheered many observers and investors. The news came early Wednesday before the Federal Reserve wrapped up its two-day meeting, where it left interest rates unchanged, as widely expected.\n\nBut in the 1970s and 1980s, the Federal Reserve was battling double-digit inflation and didn't have the luxury of patiently holding rates steady during that effort. Marketplace's Sabri Ben-Achour spoke with Marketplace correspondent Nancy Marshall-Genzer for more.\n\nNancy Marshall-Genzer: So the Fed faced some economic shocks back then that prompted it to keep raising interest rates to cool the economy, douse the flames of inflation. There was a partial OPEC oil embargo in the early 1970s, and that sent gas prices up. But today's economy is less sensitive to oil prices, partly because vehicles are a lot more fuel-efficient.\n\nSabri Ben-Achour: One other interesting fact you dug up was that the inflation of the '70s and '80s had a bit to do with how old Americans were at that time. It was a younger population. Explain that one.\n\nMarshall-Genzer: It was and, Sabri, we tend to spend more when we're younger, so demand for products and services goes up. You know the law of supply and demand: High demand pushes up prices. But now the population is older; boomers are saving more, spending less, so there's less demand putting pressure on prices.\n\nBen-Achour: The interest rate hikes of [2022 and 2023] seem like they came on strong, came on fast, but by historical standards it's not all that fast. In 1979, Paul Volcker took over as Fed chair, and in his fight with inflation, the Fed did not mess around. It was much more aggressive, right?\n\nMarshall-Genzer: Oh, absolutely. I mean, Volcker's Fed would increase rates by several percentage points at a time if it felt it needed to. Year-over-year inflation was above 11%, Sabri, when Volcker took over. Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, says Volcker did hike rates sharply, but for today's Fed, it's different.\n\nRyan Sweet: They don't have to press nearly as hard as Volcker did. Volcker essentially just slammed his foot on the brake and pushed the economy into a recession to kind of cure all our inflation woes. We don't have to do that this time around, fortunately.\n\nMarshall-Genzer: And Sweet says the Fed also realizes now that it needs to keep inflation expectations anchored because if everybody thinks inflation will rise, businesses will hike prices, workers will demand raises and inflation will rise.", "source": {"uri": "marketplace.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Marketplace"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nancy_marshall_genzer@marketplace.org", "name": "Nancy Marshall-Genzer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "sabri_ben_achour@marketplace.org", "name": "Sabri Ben-Achour", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "ariana_rosas@marketplace.org", "name": "Ariana Rosas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Volcker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Volcker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply and demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OPEC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.marketplace.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-56021990.jpg?fit=3000%2C1688&w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

interest rate cuts dispel any notion that hitting 2% inflation targets spot on is a precondition for central bank moves or indeed sensible -- and may guide thinking on the Federal Reserve and Bank of England too.\n\nThe European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada, covering four of the G7 major economies, cut interest rates on Wednesday and Thursday in the first reversals of some two years of policy tightening aimed at reining in post-pandemic inflation spikes.\n\nIn well-telegraphed moves, both announced the cuts even with headline inflation rates still above 2.0% targets -- 2.6% in the euro zone and 2.7% in Canada. \"Core\" rates, excluding energy and food and other volatile prices, are just as high.\n\nHave they rashly jumped the gun?\n\nThe reasons are well documented -- the central banks continue to insist the targets will be hit, they forecast success on that front over the next year or two and claim policy is being preemptive by removing just a notch of restraint on slow-growing economies.\n\nBut the timing also reveals the degree of latitude central banks see around what might appear like precise targets -- and how getting inflation to within one-tenth of one percentage point of a fairly arbitrary goal may be a fool's errand anyway.\n\nMany policymakers and economists doubt the wisdom of exact point targeting, citing numerous supply-side distortions in many components of inflation baskets and fretting about wider damage to economies simply to ring a 2% bell.\n\nHaving successfully punctured inflation rates to a quarter of the peaks seen in 2022, the risk of forcing recession and a rise in unemployment just to zap a final half percentage point seems to some an overly high price.\n\nThat's especially so if--as their own forecasts and financial market pricing seem to suggest--the risk of a significant re-acceleration of inflation is seen as low.\n\nThe debate then shifts to degrees of policy \"restrictiveness\" -- judged mainly by how far current policy rates are above assumed \"neutral\" levels that would no longer bear down on or stimulate economic activity.\n\nThat in itself leaves a lot of wiggle room for most central banks.\n\nEven if there's considerable uncertainty on exactly where those largely theoretical neutral rates lie, most experts agree they are much lower than now -- allowing central banks to claim a foot's on the brake even as they pare back borrowing rates.\n\nEstimates by ECB and BoC officials themselves, and indeed from Fed policymakers, indicate neutral policy rates have likely crept higher since the Covid-19 pandemic, but they are still almost half the current levels.\n\nThe ECB and BoC were at pains to stress this week that the first cuts don't necessarily presage a series that would wipe out monetary restriction altogether and they continue to monitor everything from sectoral price pressures to wage developments.\n\nBut restriction aside, central banks' formal targets themselves are not always as rigid as they seem either.\n\nThe Bank of Canada, for example, continually refers to its 2% target in public, but its most recent framework agreement with government covering the 2022-2026 period refers to the 2% target as a mid-point of a 1%-3% \"inflation-control range\".\n\nAs Canadian inflation has already spent some four months below the upper end of that range, it's not hard to see the green light to ease with the local economy slowing sharply.\n\nFor 18 years, the ECB used to have a target to get inflation \"below but close to 2%\", but its 2021 strategy review adopted a more symmetric target around 2% \"over the medium term\" -- which at the time was aimed at addressing years of undershoot and acknowledging that an averaging over the time was better.\n\nAnd even though it nudged up its 2024 and 2025 inflation forecasts a touch while cutting rates on Thursday, the ECB still expects inflation to average as low as 1.9% in 2026.\n\nFor the Fed, which holds a policy meeting next week, inflation captured by its core PCE gauge is now similar to equivalents faced by the ECB and BoC -- but it's hesitating on rate cuts due to a much stronger economy and looser US fiscal stance.\n\nHowever, the US central bank preceded the ECB in a shift of strategy in 2020 toward long-term averaging of inflation in assessing its target.\n\nAlthough it's publicly sidestepped that approach during the latest battle -- with its next review expected some time next year -- the whole approach de-emphasises the idea of hitting 2% precisely at any one point as the only policy trigger.\n\nWhat's more, the Fed's solo 2016-2019 tightening campaign to bring policy rates back up to neutral was also conducted even when core PCE rates languished below 2% for all but two months of that period. In other words, the return to neutral policy rates then didn't require inflation to be bang on target.\n\nThat same argument could be applied in reverse now.\n\nFor investors, the bias from here will likely be more restrictive policy on average in the years ahead.\n\nBut that probably shouldn't prevent some cuts from here.\n\n\"What is not being openly discussed, certainly by policymakers, is that we might not be able to get back below 2% without a severe recession,\" said Chris Iggo, chair of the AXA IM Investment Institute.\n\nHe added that just keeping a lid on inflation here may now see policy rates in a 3%-4% range on a longer-term basis in the US and the United Kingdom and at some 2%-3% in the eurozone.\n\n\"How far above that range rates go depends on the appetite for forcing inflation back down through engineering a recession, an increase in spare capacity and higher unemployment,\" Mr Iggo wrote.\n\n\"Living with inflation a little above the target range has greater social utility than the alternative.\"\u2009REUTERS\n\nMike Dolan is Reuters Editor-at-Large for Finance & Markets.", "source": {"uri": "bangkokpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangkok Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply-side_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply-side economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Axa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Spain", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.bangkokpost.com/v3/assets/images/img-default.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

The Fed has reasoned that it increased interest rates to curb inflation, although inflation climbed exponentially as it did so, critics argue.\n\nBut the 2% inflation goal and \"cooling\" inflation \"trend\" isn't the best context to understand economic health, one national economist argues. Ultimately, \"the trend is not your friend,\" E.J. Antoni, an economist with the Heritage Foundation, said, referring to \"lower inflation.\"\n\n\"Regardless of whatever ... anyone tells you, the numbers clearly show we were never trending towards the 2.0% inflation target, let alone zero, which is where we should be; we've been trending towards 3%+,\" he said in social media posts.\n\n\"A slower increase (in inflation) is still an increase and prices set a new record high,\" he added.\n\nFor homeowners, \"lower inflation\" means \"a monthly mortgage payment on a median price home in May was 119.5% higher than\" it was in January 2021. \"That's almost $14,000 per year, for 30 years, for the same house,\" he said.\n\nFor renters, it means paying sky-high rent. \"Rent continues rocketing higher, now up 21.6% since Jan '21,\" he said, making it \"hard to save for a down payment on a home when your rent is rising almost 10X your income.\"\n\nJust three months ago, home buyers needed 80% more income to purchase a home than they did in 2020, The Center Square reported, even as median income increased by 23% at the same time.\n\nFor employees, \"lower inflation\" means an hourly wage growth that \"outpaced inflation in May\" but the difference is negligible. Pointing to average hourly earnings since January 2021 from Bureau of Labor Statistics data, he said, \"We're so far behind the nominal increase of the last 3+ years that it's laughable - the difference between real and nominal wages since Jan '21 is $5.65/hr for average worker; that's more than he or she pays in federal income tax.\"\n\n\"Lower inflation\" means average hourly earnings are down by 2.2% and average weekly earnings are down by nearly 4% since January 2021 because of \"the collapse of full-time jobs\" replaced by part-time jobs, he said.\n\nOther economists have also pointed to jobs report discrepancies primarily based on part-time jobs data. They've forecast a recession to hit later this year because the labor market and economy aren't as strong as they seem, The Center Square reported.\n\n\"Lower inflation\" also means energy prices are up an average of 35.6% in less than 3.5 years, with gasoline and diesel up over 40% and 50%, respectively, Antoni said. The percentages are seasonally adjusted; not seasonally adjusted costs are higher, he said.\n\nIt means consumer food prices are up an average of 21.2% since January 2021, he said, but many staples saw much larger price increases. The costs of eggs, bread and peanut butter are all up by more than 35%; cereal and chicken are up over 25%.\n\n\"No wonder people are having to put groceries on credit card,\" he said.\n\n\"Lower inflation\" also means \"that virtually all the costs related to owning and operating a vehicle are up 40%+, making it much harder for people to maintain the independence of having their own car or truck,\" he said.\n\nAntoni also pointed out that on Tuesday, the U.S. federal debt broke $34.7 trillion for the first time in history. In one day, on Monday, it grew by $37 billion.\n\n\"The debt has now risen $7 trillion since January 2021, that's an annualized rate of over $2 trillion, and accelerating,\" he said.\n\nCopy article link", "source": {"uri": "azdailysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arizona Daily Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Center_Square", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Center Square"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heritage_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Heritage Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_as_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egg as food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Income tax in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National debt of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut_butter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peanut butter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diesel fuel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/azdailysun.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/3d/53d0e8f2-28e1-11ef-985d-e73ff50a1951/6669db0a9a31b.image.jpg?crop=990%2C520%2C0%2C70&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has spearheaded a partisan attack on independent monetary policy, calling once again for the Fed to slash interest rates despite inflation persisting at nearly twice the central bank's maximum target of 2%.\n\nBut this time, not only does the senator say high rates risk a recession, a plausible enough possibility, but Warren also outlandishly claims that the current interest rate policy \"is driving up housing and auto insurance costs, which are currently the main drivers of the overall inflation rate.\"\n\nThe auto insurance canard is easier to debunk: According to May's consumer price index report, motor vehicle insurance actually fell by 0.3% last month, even while the federal funds rate remained at 23-year highs. And why? Because car insurance simply lags behind cars overall, which soared in price during the pandemic thanks to both the supply chain shortage of COVID-19 and the demand induced by multi-trillion dollar deficits.\n\nThe notion that housing costs are being driven by the Fed is more complicated but also a more pernicious lie to debunk. It is true that increased mortgage rates are reflected in both the increasing list prices of homes on the market as well as the Bureau of Labor Statistics official measure of \"owners' equivalent rent of primary residences,\" which samples how much an owner would charge if he or she were to rent out the primary home in which he or she currently resides. But even as rental prices have dramatically diverged from the cost of home ownership, \"rent of primary residence\" inflation is pretty similar to OER inflation.\n\nWhat about home prices themselves, rather than the BLS's attempt to estimate their inflation rates? We all know that the primary factor fueling home prices is the intersection of pent-up demand and supply shortages thanks to a decade of terrible zoning strangulation, but do mortgage rates increase the costs of homes? Obviously not.\n\nIn the simplest terms, monetary tightening is continuing to succeed in bringing home prices down. The average home price, which peaked at $525,100 in 2022, has since slightly decreased to $513,100, while the median home price sunk to $420,800 from its 2022 peak of $442,600. According to the IMF, although home prices are up nearly 20% since before COVID-19, they've fallen by 2.4% since last year. This is clearly an incredibly modest softening in the market, but it's much better than the alternative desired by Warren.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nWhile the BLS provided the year's first bit of evidence that inflation is finally slowing overall, CPI inflation is north of 3%, PCE inflation well above 2%, and \"supercore\" inflation still close to 5%. One good data point is necessary, but not sufficient, to establish the trend that the Fed can cut interest rates without triggering rebound inflation.\n\nOf course, Warren's calculus here isn't economic but rather political. At the start of the year, the Fed projected it would slash rates three times while investors telegraphed more than twice as many cuts. Now, even with today's decent data, treasury futures reflect the Fed will only cut rates once before Election Day. Warren's appeal may be futile, but make no mistake: The message to Democrats, that they can blame the Fed if Biden fails, is clear.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tiana_lowe_doescher@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Tiana Lowe Doescher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vehicle insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Consumer Price Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Spain", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_appraisal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate appraisal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calculus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Monetary Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Residential_Housing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Residential Housing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AP23341510034744-scaled.jpg.optimal.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

The downgrade in their outlook for rate cuts would mean that such borrowing costs would likely stay higher for longer, a disappointment for potential homebuyers and others.\n\nStill, the Fed's quarterly projections of future interest rate cuts are by no means fixed in time. The policymakers frequently revise their plans for rate cuts -- or hikes -- depending on how economic growth and inflation measures evolve over time.\n\n[...]", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Master of Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benchmarking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Car finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Travel", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-06-", "textStart": 138, "textEnd": 145}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Annual CPI inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022, the highest level since the early 1980s, as a variety of inflationary factors came to a head simultaneously, including elevated energy prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the effects of the influx of cash from government stimulus checks and supply chain bottlenecks related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Inflation's downward trend came as the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates in an effort to slow consumer spending. Higher rates are unwelcome for borrowers like mortgage seekers and small business loan applicants, but they did help bring down inflation to a more palatable level. Still, inflation is well above the historically accepted 2% target. Goldman Sachs economists project headline CPI inflation to fall to 3.1% by the end of 2024 and 2.6% by the end of 2025. Inflation was not over 2.9% from 2015 to 2020, proving there is still work to be done.\n\n5.3%. That's how much more expensive average rent was than it was in May 2023, according to CPI. Rent is among the stickiest and most painful items to grow more expensive in recent years, up more than 25% since May 2020, shortly before the beginning of this inflation cycle.\n\nThe Fed's interest rate-setting committee will announce the results of its June meeting at 2 p.m. ET.

But the risk-reward is getting narrower.\"\n\nChris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley says \"the story isn't over\" after CPI as the Fed has said it wants to see an established trend of falling inflation.\n\n\"A September cut is still in play -- as long as we get more numbers like this one.\"\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee, which has held its benchmark rate at a two-decade high since July, was encouraged by a sharp decline in inflation in the second half of 2023 to pencil in a gradual reduction in rates this year. In March, the quarterly \"dot plot\" signaled three quarter-point cuts in 2024. But most recently bets had been mounting on fewer reductions.\n\n\"Altogether, this report probably shifts the focus back to two or three rate cuts in 2024,\" said Jason Pride at Glenmede.\n\nTo Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets, the softer read on inflation clears the path for the \"dot plot\" to signal 50 basis points of cuts this year.\n\n\"The Fed's last mile toward price stability is getting shorter,\" said Quincy Krosby at LPL Financial. \"This should help the FOMC, today preparing its dot plot and fine tuning its statement, offer a more positive view regarding monetary easing despite invoking their well-practiced reminder that they remain data dependent and require additional confirmation that inflation continues to trend lower.\"\n\nDavid Russell at TradeStation notes that inflation is slowing even as the economy accelerates.\n\n\"Things are playing out as the Fed hoped, so Jerome Powell will probably be feeling good this afternoon,\" he said. \"September could be back in play for a rate cut. The bears have nowhere to run to and nowhere to hide.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 is in its 12th bull market since 1955, according to Jim Paulsen, a retired well-known stock bull on Wall Street and author of the \"Paulsen Perspectives\" newsletter. Before its latest run to all-time highs, the fed funds rate was reduced prior to the start of every bull run -- except once when the first cut occurred concurrently with the start of a bull in 1966.\n\nIn the prior 11 bull markets, borrowing costs were trimmed anywhere from 0 to 27 months before a new bull started, with an average lead time of 9.5 months, he said. That means Fed officials typically provided a supportive rate policy months before a new bull market emerged and kept cutting borrowing costs long after a new bull was in process.\n\nSome of the main

They do this for a few reasons. First, food and energy tend to be more volatile than most other goods. Accordingly, they can distort the broader price trends. Second, food and energy prices are affected by many variables, many of which the Fed is unable to manage. Lastly, the Fed believes core inflation is a better predictive measure of inflation.\n\nSo, while the Fed prefers to ignore food and energy prices, they also heavily rely on energy prices, albeit indirectly. Jerome Powell and other Fed members have emphasized that inflation expectations are very important to follow as they influence inflation. The problem with the Fed's logic is that energy prices greatly sway inflation expectations. The graph on the left shows crude oil and 1-year inflation expectations. As shown, they track each other closely. We share the same data in a scatter plot to the right to highlight the relationship further. The R-squared (.57) is statistically significant.\n\nBottom line: energy is used to manufacture, produce, and ship a wide range of goods. While the Fed may want to ignore energy prices, they are too important to the economy, the prices of other goods, and our inflation expectations to dismiss.\n\nIn yesterday's commentary, we discussed the decline in oil prices and how, from a trading perspective, this sets up a decent opportunity for an energy trade. Adding to that thesis were two other points for why we added to our position in Diamondback Energy (FANG) in our equity portfolio yesterday.\n\nThe first is that speculative trading accounts sharply reduced their bets on oil. The recent sharp liquidation of those contracts provides the fuel for a reversal trade.\n\nSecondly, over the last 10 weeks, energy has been corrected from being overbought to being oversold on a relative and absolute performance basis.\n\nWhile this does not mean that energy stocks are about to explode higher, the data does suggest that a tradable opportunity is present over the next few months. Such is particularly true as we enter peak driving and hurricane season, where potential demand and drilling disruptions could increase prices.\n\nPart of today's FOMC announcement will include the revised economic projections, aka dot plots. The table below shows the projections from March. Revisions to the unemployment rate and GDP will shed light on how their views may have changed over the past three months due to some weaker-than-expected economic data. Projections for Core PCE were increased by 0.2% at the March meeting. If they lower it back down, it will infer confidence that inflation is falling again after having stalled.\n\nLastly, and certainly most important for investors, is the Fed's outlook on the Fed Funds rate. In March, they thought they could reduce Fed Funds by .75% by year-end. The Fed Funds market implies equal odds of 25 or 50 bps in cuts by year-end. We suspect the Fed will gravitate toward the market's view. The Fed will probably want to avoid adjusting rates at the September meeting because it's an election year. Furthermore, July may be too early for a cut unless inflation declines more than expected. If we assume they skip the next two meetings, that only leaves two more meetings before the year's end.\n\nGiven our opening paragraphs about the connection between energy prices and inflation expectations and how the Fed may proceed with monetary policy, it's worth debunking a narrative. As much as you keep hearing, gas prices are not spiking. Yes, they have been up over 10% for the year to date. However, gas prices tend to follow a seasonal pattern, increasing into the summer driving season and then giving up those price increases in the year's second half.\n\nThe graph below charts the average weekly year-to-date change in gas prices from 2005 to 2023 and compares it to the change in gas prices this year. As shown, gas prices rose more than the average in the first fifteen weeks of 2024. However, that reversed sharply. The current year-to-date change is now about 10% less than is typical for this time of the year. Gasoline prices are volatile, so we should be careful not to read too much into this graph.

That's down from 3.4% in April.\n\n\"I think this report reinforces the disinflationary narrative, that inflation is almost back in the bottle,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.\n\nThe CPI gauges how fast prices are changing across the U.S. economy. It measures everything from fruits and vegetables to haircuts, concert tickets and household appliances.\n\nThe April inflation reading is down significantly from its 9.1% pandemic-era peak in 2022, which was the highest level since 1981. However, it remains above policymakers' long-term target, around 2%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve uses inflation data to guide its interest rate policy. Economists expect the central bank to leave borrowing costs unchanged -- at a roughly two-decade high -- at the conclusion of its latest policy meeting later Wednesday.\n\nHowever, the newest batch of inflation data supports the notion of an interest-rate cut in coming months, assuming the trajectory doesn't change, economists said.\n\n\"We still need several more months of this, but the fundamentals are encouraging,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note Wednesday.\n\nWhile annual data on inflation trends are helpful, economists generally recommend looking at monthly numbers as a better guide of short-term movements and inflation trends.\n\nThe monthly reading was unchanged, at 0% in May, down from 0.3% in April and 0.4% in March. (To get back to target, economists say the monthly reading should consistently be in the range of about 0.2%.)\n\nThat downward move was \"largely driven\" by lower gasoline prices, said Joe Seydl, senior markets economist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.\n\nU.S. gasoline prices fell 3.6% in the month from April to May, after having increased in each of the prior three months, according to CPI data. (Prices are up about 2% over the past year.)\n\nConsumers paid an average pump price of roughly $3.58 a gallon at the end of May, according to weekly data published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nThey've continued to decline since then: Average prices were $3.43 a gallon as of June 10.\n\nThere has also been a broad pullback in grocery prices.\n\nMonthly \"food at home\" inflation has been at 0% (or even negative) for the past four months, according to CPI data.\n\n\"Food inflation has fallen back really sharply,\" said Olivia Cross, a North America economist at Capital Economics.\n\nThat's largely due to falling prices for agricultural commodities, in addition to others like easing pressures in the labor market, she said.\n\nEconomists also generally like to consider an inflation measure that strips out energy and food prices, which can be volatile, to determine prevailing inflation trends.\n\nThat reading, known as \"core\" CPI, fell to a monthly 0.2% reading in May (down from 0.3% in April) and 3.4% on an annual basis (down from 3.6%).\n\nSome components or core CPI remain trouble spots. Chief among them is housing, which has remained stubbornly elevated, economists said.\n\nShelter inflation was 5.4% annually in May, down marginally from 5.5% in April.\n\nMore from Personal Finance:\n\nWhy a five-day return to office is unlikely\n\nThese are the 'hidden costs' of homeownership\n\nHere's how 'spaving' could hurt your finances\n\nShelter inflation has an outsized impact on CPI numbers because it's by far consumers' largest expenditure.\n\n\"It's falling more slowly than people were hoping for,\" said Michael Pugliese, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Economics. \"It moves at a glacial pace both up and down.\"\n\nThat said, housing inflation is falling. It's down from a peak over 8% in March 2023.\n\nEconomists expect it to continue to decline given prevailing real estate trends, but say it will likely take a while for that cycle to play out.\n\nFor example, market rents for new leases are flat and \"haven't gone anywhere for two years,\" Zandi said.\n\n\"Basic [household] necessities -- food, gas, rent -- they're all going nowhere fast, and that's really very encouraging,\" Zandi added.\n\nAside from housing, other categories with \"notable increases\" over the last year include motor vehicle insurance (up 20.3%), medical care (+3.1%), recreation (+1.3%) and personal care (+2.9%), the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.\n\nMeanwhile, some categories have seen prices pull back. Broadly, physical goods prices (excluding food and energy commodities) declined by 1.7% in the past year, including a 9.3% reduction for used cars and trucks; airline fares are also down, by 5.9%.\n\nInflation for physical goods spiked as the U.S. economy reopened in 2021. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains, while Americans spent more on their homes and less on services like dining out and entertainment.\n\nNow, \"the goods side of the inflation story is pretty much back to normal,\" Pugliese said. \"It's really the services side that's been much slower moving.\"\n\nThere are many reasons for that, economists said.\n\nFor example, a surge in new and used car prices a few years ago is likely now fueling high inflation for motor vehicle insurance and repair, since it generally costs more to insure and repair pricier cars, economists said.\n\nThe services sector is also generally more sensitive to inflationary pressures in the labor market like strong wage growth.\n\nRecord-high demand for workers as the pandemic-era economy reopened pushed wage growth to its highest level in decades; the labor market has since cooled and wage growth has declined, though remains above its pre-pandemic level.\n\nAverage hourly earnings for private-sector workers grew at a 4.1% annual pace in May, down from a peak near 6% in March 2022.\n\n\"From a wage inflation perspective, we're still too high,\" J.P. Morgan's Seydl said.\n\nHowever, data suggest wages will continue to cool from here, he added.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fruit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zandi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zandi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Economics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capital Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moody's_Analytics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moody's Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_appliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home appliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vegetable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Stocks and bonds rallied Wednesday on the better-than-expected news on inflation and in anticipation of the Fed's announcement.\n\n\"Inflation has eased over the past year, but remains elevated,\" the Fed announced in its statement, adding that interest rates would remain in a range of 5.25% to 5.50%.\n\nBut, it did take two cuts off the table for this year, leaving only one projected by members of its monetary policy committee. For 2025, it signaled a more aggressive posture with its \"dot plot\" of individual member estimates at four cuts next year, up from three previously.\n\nThe changes mean five total cuts penciled in between now and the end of 2025, down from six three months ago.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the Labor Department said that May's consumer price index was unchanged from a month earlier while the annual rate dipped slightly to 3.3%. Notable improvement was seen in energy and food costs.\n\n\"Given unfavorable year-on-year comparisons, CPI inflation is likely to hover around an 'uncomfortable plateau' over the summer with headline inflation around 3.3% and core inflation around 3.4%,\" said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY. \"While softer consumer spending growth due to increased pricing sensitivity, moderating wage growth, declining rent inflation, reduced markups, and stronger productivity growth will continue to provide a healthy disinflationary impulse, it's not until September that inflation readings will fall below that uncomfortable plateau.\"\n\nKey to the disinflation narrative is further progress on housing costs. Those rose at an annual rate of 5.4% in May, barely budging from a month earlier but down from the 8% rate seen in 2023. Housing cost data takes a long time to pass through to CPI, of which it is a major component.\n\n\"I think the issue for housing is the lag effect,\" says David Page, head of AXA Investment Managers macro research team. Still, he says the benign May CPI \"makes the Fed's job a lot easier.\"\n\nIn any case, prolonged high interest rates are likely to mean continued high borrowing costs for consumers. To some, this is keeping the economy \"bifurcated\" with higher income Americans profiting from the rise in home and asset prices as well as high returns on their savings while lower income workers struggle.\n\n\"The delay in rate cuts will continue to strain lower- and middle-income consumers,\" said Stephen Rich, chairman & CEO of Mutual of America Capital Management. \"Prices remain elevated, from housing and car insurance to pet services and dining out, keeping pressure on Americans' bank accounts.\"\n\n\"The overall financial health of consumers has held up much better than expected, but negative indicators are starting to show, including the rise in subprime auto loans and credit card delinquencies,\" he added. \"These trends could signal trouble ahead for many Americans, even as the economy generally remains strong.\"", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Car finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Consumer Price Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_&_Young", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ernst & Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Axa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disinflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_lending", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subprime lending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/d0ae8d7/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F3c%2Fd6%2Fbb2f48c54a60971f3c1dcea63327%2Fap24164669425769.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Relative to their last projections in March, the Fed now sees faster GDP growth, inflation that doesn't come down as fast, and unemployment that remains very low.- Greg McBride, Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst\n\nFed's interest rate history of 1981-1990: Volcker fights the 'Great Inflation' with historic rate moves and aggressively hawkish monetary policy\n\nThe fed funds rate has never been as high as it was in the 1980s.\n\nThe main reason is because the Fed wanted to combat inflation, which soared in 1980 to its highest level on record: 14.6 percent.\n\nAs a result, the U.S. central bank did something that might seem counterintuitive for an institution that strives to maintain the most productive economy possible: It manufactured a recession to bring prices back down.\n\nThe fed funds rate began the decade at a target level of 14 percent in January 1980. By the time officials concluded a conference call on Dec. 5, 1980, they hiked the target range by 2 percentage points to 19-20 percent, its highest ever.\n\nConsumer borrowing costs soared as a result. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hit the highest on record during the era, spiking to near 20 percent, Bankrate's historic data shows.\n\nKey insights on the 1981-1990 era\n\nBut the Fed has changed almost as much as interest rates since then. Instead of slowly and gradually moving rates in one direction (up or down), interest rates would often rise, then fall, then rise again.\n\nRates fell sharply to a target range of 13-14 percent on Nov. 2, 1981, then back up to 15 percent in the first four months of 1982, then back down to 11.5-12 percent on July 20, 1982, records of the moves show. The \"effective\" fed funds rate averaged at 9.97 percent during this 10-year period. Interest rates haven't eclipsed 10 percent since November 1984.\n\nOne reason for the volatility: Chair Paul Volcker decided that the best way to combat inflation involved limiting the growth of the money supply, rather than directly targeting interest rates - the way officials control inflation today.\n\nOther differences between today's Fed and the Fed of the past include a wider target range for the benchmark fed funds rate, sometimes spanning 5 percentage points instead of the 0.25 percentage point window today. Not to mention, the Fed would adjust rates at unscheduled meetings more often than not, after which it wouldn't release policy statements.\n\nChairman Paul Volcker was the main driver of Fed policy in this decade, leading the Fed until Chairman Alan Greenspan took the post in August 1987.\n\nCritics at the time vilified Volcker for harming the economy. Farmers, for example, drove their tractors to the Fed's headquarters in Washington, D.C., to protest higher interest rates, according to historians at the St. Louis Fed, while car dealers mailed him car keys of unsold vehicles in coffins.\n\nThe moves came with a price: Unemployment soared to almost 11 percent, at the time the highest since the Great Depression, historic Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. Inflation, however, stayed away for years, falling to below 2 percent by 1986.\n\nFed interest rate history of 1991-2000: Alan Greenspan steers the Fed through a brief recession then presides over 'Great Moderation' with a long economic expansion\n\nFed rate moves\n\nAfter a tumultuous few years for the Fed during the Great Inflation, Greenspan faced a much calmer period, though that's not to say he didn't have his fair share of challenges during his near 18-year tenure at the helm of the Fed.\n\nAfter an eight-month recession beginning in August 1990, Greenspan and Co. managed to take the fed funds rate all the way up to a target level of 6.5 percent in May 2000, the highest of the period. Rates reached a low of 3 percent in September 1992, the lowest of the decade.\n\nBesides during the early 1990s, the Fed mainly adjusted rates at Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, a practice that is in rhythm with today's Fed. Officials did hike rates on April 19, 1994, at an emergency meeting due to inflation worries, and they cut borrowing costs at an unscheduled Oct. 15, 1998, gathering.\n\nKey insights on the 1991-2000 era\n\nAnother noteworthy feat, the U.S. central bank also made its first \"insurance\" cuts, meaning officials cut interest rates to give the economy an extra boost, not to fight a recession. Such was the case in 1995, 1996 and 1998, when the financial system confronted a share of headwinds ranging from debt default in Russia to a major hedge fund's collapse.\n\nThe longest-serving Fed chair to date, Greenspan is often nicknamed \"maestro\" for having steered the economy through the longest economic expansion at the time. The Fed unofficially began identifying 2 percent as its inflation target during this decade - a pivotal decision that would irrevocably change modern monetary policy.\n\nA proponent of deregulation, however, his policies would later be blamed for fueling asset bubbles that led to the dot-com boom and bust and the housing bubble that sparked the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nFed interest rate history of 2001-2010: Fed faces the dotcom bust, the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the 2008 financial crisis\n\nThe 2000s were the Fed's most rhythmic period yet, with the Fed following clear cycles for both tightening and loosening rates.\n\nTo start the decade, the Fed slashed interest rates 13 times to a low of 1 percent - a range that might've been unthinkable for those who remembered rates in the '80s - after a stock market bubble in the technology sector burst, kickstarting a recession that was exacerbated by the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nKey insights on the 2001-2010 era\n\nThe U.S. central bank then managed to hike interest rates 17 times between 2004 and 2006 - all of those increases in gradual, quarter-point moves - to a high of 5.25 percent.\n\nThat was until the financial crisis of 2008 happened and the ensuing Great Recession, which slammed the brakes on the economy. The Fed then did the unthinkable: It slashed interest rates by 100 basis points to near-zero. Chairman Ben Bernanke led the Fed during this period, which was, at the time, one of its most aggressive economic rescue efforts in Fed history.\n\nDuring this era, the Fed also unveiled an experimental, unconventional monetary policy tool: quantitative easing, or large scale asset purchases (LSAPs) as they're formally known. A massive bond-buying program to lower long-term interest rates and give the economy a bigger boost caused the Fed's balance sheet to balloon, soaring to $4.5 trillion from a starting place of $870 billion.\n\nFed interest rate history of 2011-2020: The economy recovers from the Great Recession and faces the coronavirus pandemic a decade later\n\nThe Fed couldn't escape zero rates in the 2010s just as much as it couldn't escape devastating recessions.\n\nOfficials would ultimately end up leaving interest rates at rock-bottom until 2015, after which they only hiked interest rates by 25 basis points once per year. That is, until 2017, when the Fed hiked three times, and 2018, when they hiked four more times. The fed funds rate peaked at 2.25-2.5 percent.\n\nFacing tepid inflation and moderating growth, the Fed also decided in 2019 to cut interest rates three times to give the economy a fresh boost - similar to Greenspan's \"insurance\" cuts of the 1990s.\n\nKey insights on the 2011-2020 era\n\nThe fed funds rate looked like it was about to settle there until the coronavirus pandemic came along, ushering back in another era of near-zero rates. The Fed slashed rates to zero across two emergency meetings within 13 days of each other as the gears of the economy came to a halt.\n\nChair Janet Yellen took the helm of the Fed from Bernanke in February 2014 and steered the economy through its Great Recession recovery until February 2018, when Chair Jerome Powell was installed.\n\nFed interest rate today 2021-present: The Fed's latest moves in an era of soaring inflation\n\nIt's been a blast from the past for Fed rate-setting, with inflation returning as the No. 1 economic threat in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis.\n\nThe Fed hiked interest rates by a quarter point in March 2022 for the first time since 2018, leaving interest rates at near-zero percent for two years to give the economy time to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. They didn't stop breaking milestones there. The Fed approved the largest rate hike since 2000 during its May gathering when it raised interest rates by half a percentage point, as well as the largest rate hike since 1994 when it lifted interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point in June. The Fed followed up on that historic move with three additional increases of that size.\n\nOfficials felt comfortable leaving their foot on the gas even as inflation soared to a 40-year high - in part, because they were guided under a false assumption that massive price pressures were only transitory.\n\nExperts say U.S. central bankers usually worry about the wrong conflict. Just how officials spent the 1990s worried about inflation, the Fed probably spent the early 2020s fearing too-low inflation, says Scott Sumner, monetary policy chair emeritus at George Mason University's Mercatus Center.\n\n\"Central banks tend to focus on fighting the last war,\" Sumner says. \"If you have a lot of inflation, you get a more hawkish stance. If you've undershot your inflation target, then the Fed thinks, 'Well, maybe we should've been more expansionary.' Powell came into his job with that determination, that if there was another recession, they would be more aggressive. My own view is that the strategy was relatively successful at first but pushed too far.\"\n\nKey insights on the 2021-2022 era\n\nBy many standards, however, an entirely different U.S. central bank is steering the boat, meaning officials don't want to tame inflation with aggressive, volatile rate hikes similar to the 1980s, he adds. Yet, officials have also spoken out against the stop-and-go manner of rate hikes leading up to the Great Inflation of the 1980s.\n\n\"The successful Volcker disinflation in the early 1980s followed multiple failed attempts to lower inflation over the previous 15 years,\" Powell said in a pivotal 2022 speech at the Fed's annual monetary policy symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. \"Our aim is to avoid that outcome by acting with resolve now.\"\n\nThe Fed has made great progress bringing inflation back toward their 2 percent inflation target. Prices in April rose 3.4 percent from a year ago, almost three times slower than the eye-popping 9.1 percent annual rate from June 2022, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics consumer price index (CPI). Excluding the more volatile food and energy categories, so-called core inflation is up 3.6 percent from a year ago, BLS data also shows.\n\nYet, price pressures aren't slowing as quickly as they once were, underscoring just how much harder the next mile of getting price pressures down to Fed officials' goal may be.\n\nEven if the Fed doesn't end up raising rates more from here, stubborn inflation could lead the Fed to keep borrowing costs high for longer. Yet, the more inflation falls, the more restrictive interest rates could become.\n\nThe Fed's preferred gauge of inflation shows better improvement, but price pressures still look stubborn. Overall prices in April rose 2.7 percent from a year ago, less than half a percentage point above the Fed's official target but matching levels from March and up from 2.5 percent in February, separate data from the Department of Commerce shows.\n\nBottom line\n\nEven if the Fed eventually cuts interest rates this year, borrowing costs are likely to stay higher than they were in the pandemic era. With higher interest rates likely here to stay, concentrate on eliminating high-interest debt, boosting your credit score and shopping around for the best places where you can park your cash, so your money is rewarded.\n\n\"If the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year,\" Powell said in a March congressional testimony. \"But the economic outlook is uncertain, and ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured.\"", "source": {"uri": "islandpacket.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Wall Street stumbled in premarket trading ahead of a busy week of inflation reports and the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate policy decision. (AP Photo/Peter Morgan)NEW YORK (AP) - U.S. stocks are holding onto most of their gains for the day after the Federal Reserve held its main interest rate steady. The S&P 500 was 0.9% higher Wednesday afternoon after rising as much as 1.3% earlier following a surprisingly encouraging report on inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was close to flat, while the Nasdaq composite was up 1.6%. Treasury yields remained lower after the Fed indicated most of its policymakers still expect to cut interest rates at some point this year. A report on Wednesday raised hopes for such a move after showing a slowdown in inflation during May. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. NEW YORK (AP) - U.S. stocks are jumping amid a worldwide rally Wednesday following a surprisingly encouraging update on inflation. The S&P 500 was 1.1% higher in afternoon trading and on track to add to its all-time high set a day earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 57 points, or 0.2%, as of 1:11 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.8% higher. The action was even stronger in the bond market, where Treasury yields tumbled after the report showed U.S. consumers paid prices that were 3.3% higher for food, insurance and everything else last month, versus a year earlier. Economists had been expecting to see the inflation rate stuck at 3.4%. For Wall Street, a slowdown in inflation not only helps U.S. households struggling to keep up with fast-rising prices, it also opens the door for the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate. Such a move would ease pressure on the economy and give a boost to investment prices. Everything from bitcoin to gold to copper rallied after the inflation data raised expectations for coming cuts to interest rates. A measure of nervousness among investors in U.S. stocks also eased. Virtually no one expects the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates at its latest meeting, which is scheduled to end Wednesday afternoon. The Fed has been adamant that it needs an accumulation of data showing inflation is sustainably heading toward its 2% target. \"This is good news, but we will need more of it,\"\u009d according to Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. But it's welcome news after progress on bringing inflation down seemed to stall early this year. Some stronger-than-expected reports recently on the job market also raised worries about upward pressure remaining on inflation. Of course, too quick a slowdown in inflation could also raise worries that spending by U.S. consumers is falling off too sharply, which could lead to a recession. Bets among traders built for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates as soon as September, according to data from CME Group. That had areas of the stock market that tend to benefit most from lower interest rates doing the best amid a widespread rally. Smaller companies that need to borrow to grow and feel the pinch of higher interest rates more than their larger rivals were leading the market. The smaller stocks in the Russell 2000 index jumped 2.6%. Real-estate stocks were also shooting higher. Lower interest rates mean bonds are paying less in interest, which can send potential investors to dividend-paying real-estate owners instead. Office owner Boston Properties jumped 4.8%. Lower interest rates could also pull down mortgage rates and inject energy into the housing market. Homebuilder D.R. Horton climbed 4.8%. Oracle helped lead Wall Street higher with a jump of 12.1% even though it reported weaker profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Financial analysts pointed to strong bookings, including contracts related to artificial-intelligence training. A furor around AI has helped send stocks to records despite worries about high interest rates and the slowdown in the economy that they induce. Nvidia again was one of the strongest forces pushing the S&P 500 higher, with a gain of 4.4%. The chip company has become the poster child of the AI rush, and its total market value has topped $3 trillion. The only company to push more on the S&P 500 than Nvidia was Apple, which jumped 4.4%. Its stock has been jumping the last two days after getting a cool initial reception to the announcement of several AI-related offerings coming to its operating systems. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.26% from 4.40% late Monday and from 4.60% a couple weeks ago. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, slumped to 4.68% from 4.83% late Monday. In stock markets abroad, European indexes jumped following the release of the encouraging U.S. inflation data. In Asia, where markets closed before the data came out, indexes were mixed. Japan's Nikkei 225 index lost 0.7% as investors wait for the Bank of Japan's latest announcement on interest rates due Friday. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@medicinehatnews.com", "name": "Canadian Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Properties", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Properties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CME_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CME Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikkei 225"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://medicinehatnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cp/20240611090640-666853c6a2a11d0791b110e6jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2011-06-", "textStart": 49, "textEnd": 56}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

If Pakistanis can expect prices to drop in the coming days, they can make better financial plans and help the government tame inflation, which has been painfully clocking at around 30% over the last few months. So, how do policymakers determine whether inflation is getting better or worse?\n\nAlthough much attention is focused on the CPI (Consumer Price Index) report, our central bank's preferred measure should be the price index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), which covers a much broader range of spending and should be tabulated and released monthly by Pakistan's Bureau of Statistics. The CPI index captures what consumers pay out-of-pocket for goods and services, while the PCE index covers spending by and on behalf of households, including non-profit institutions that provide services to households. For example, in the PCE index, healthcare costs reflect consumers' out-of-pocket expenses as well as costs covered by employer-provided insurance, social security, medical coverage, philanthropic organizations, and government programs, while the CPI index only covers the direct costs to consumers. Thus, in the PCE index, healthcare has a much greater weight.\n\nOur central bank should also consider releasing average inflation figures tabulated over longer periods -- perhaps 6 months, one year, and up to two years -- because month-to-month data can be variable. Additionally, beyond the headline inflation number, it would be beneficial for the State Bank of Pakistan to provide subcategories in the data, allowing markets to determine whether price changes are temporary or long-lasting.\n\nOne important measure is \"core\" inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices. Almost all markets closely watch this benchmark. Food and energy prices can move dramatically each month and might not reflect longer-term price trends, as these changes could result from temporary factors and could reverse relatively quickly. If we only looked at overall inflation, we might think general prices are rising or falling more rapidly than they really are. For example, core CPI in Pakistan has been increasing at a much slower pace than in June and July this year. This allows us to understand specific price trends. During the pandemic, consumers ramped up spending on goods easily sourced online, leading to rapid price increases for non-perishable food items or those with longer shelf lives. Meanwhile, it is also important to monitor inflation for services like rents, which make up a large portion of core inflation and a significant chunk of household budgets. Private-sector data in Pakistan suggests that rent prices are starting to cool, but reporting lags mean it will take time for that to be reflected in the official data. However, this is good news. While easing rent prices would be welcome, it is ideal to see inflation lower particularly in essential food\n\nIn essence, while the central bank and the government should pay close attention to core inflation, they still need to primarily focus on food and energy, as these categories tend to impact people's expectations about future inflation. Relief in food and fuel prices affects many consumers' daily lives. Interestingly, categories such as new and used cars have seen price declines in recent months, which is a positive sign in the current battle against inflation. Although some momentum is cooling off, especially on the goods side, too many components are still showing too much strength.\n\nFinally, your expectations about inflation matter. In modern strategies to fight inflation, governments also track inflation expectations, which is the rate at which people expect prices to rise in the future. This affects actual inflation because consumers, businesses, and investors may change their spending behavior today based on their expectations. The Pakistani government must be careful not to indulge in populist measures or policy announcements that could spike inflation, as these could undermine efforts to tame it. For example, an artificially high minimum wage rate could render domestic manufacturing uncompetitive compared to regional neighbors and lead to a \"wage-price spiral,\" where price increases lead to higher wages, further increasing prices. Recently, Bangladeshi policymakers resisted this to avoid losing their export markets. If consumers pay more for goods and services, they may demand higher wages, and businesses may increase prices to cover labor costs, creating a cycle that is difficult to break.\n\nThe next quarter will be critical in tackling inflation, and the government must tread carefully to maintain the hope that wage growth is slowing due to a cooling labor market and firms' inability to afford significant wage increases in anticipation of high inflation for at least another year.

This followed a 0.3 per cent increase in April.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had expected a rise of 0.1 per cent.\n\nThe dollar index, which measures the performance of the U.S. currency against six others, fell 0.7 per cent, heading for its largest one-day drop in around a month.\n\nU.S. stock futures rose between 0.8-1 per cent after the numbers, from having shown a gain of just 0.1 per cent earlier in the day. European shares bounced, pushing the STOXX 600 up by more than 1 per cent.\n\nEven though prices did not change on a monthly basis, inflation likely remains too high for the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates before September against the backdrop of a persistently strong jobs market.\n\nThe Fed wraps up a policy meeting later in the day. Wednesday's inflation figures may have offered investors some encouragement that rates are about to drop.\n\nBut in light of last week's forecast-beating employment numbers, analysts said Fed Chair Jerome Powell may need more evidence to be convinced inflation is evaporating.\n\n\"While September may be on the table, today would have had to be the first of a handful of inflation data prints that went right, which it did,\" Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said.\n\n\"It does remain challenging, however, for inflation to cool with the backdrop of the summer's heat. Let's see what the Fed forecasts this afternoon. This is good news, but we will need more of it,\" Rosner said.\n\nU.S. Treasury prices leapt, pushing yields down, as investors piled into fixed income. The yield on the two-year note, the most sensitive to shifts in expectations for monetary policy, fell by as much as 15 basis points to a low of 4.687 per cent. Ten-year notes were last yielding 4.291 per cent, showing a drop of 11 bps on the day.\n\nNext up is the Fed rate decision. The central bank is not expected to make any change to interest rates at its policy meeting. Instead, the focus will be on whether it keeps three rate cuts in its \"dot plot\" projections for this year.\n\nAfter the consumer inflation figures, rate futures implied a 70 per cent chance of a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, compared with around 60 per cent earlier on..\n\n\"The (inflation) data does lessen the chances of a hawkish shift in Chair Powell's rhetoric at the post meeting press conference, even if the dot plot is likely to show a median expectation of 50bp, from 75bp, of cuts this year,\" Pepperstone market analyst Michael Brown said.\n\nWith the dollar under pressure and yields falling, gold, which had been trading in negative territory before the CPI data, was up 0.6 per cent at $2,328 an ounce, while crude oil extended gains, rising 1.2 per cent on the day to $82.80 a barrel.\n\n(Additional reporting by Davide Barbuscia and Saqib Ahmed in New York and Stella Qiu in Sydney;

Unlock access to InvestingPro's AI-selected stock winners for just $0.60 a day!\n\nThe Federal Reserve will reveal its latest policy decision on Wednesday afternoon and the stakes are high. The announcement will come just a few hours after the May CPI report came in cooler than expected.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nNo action by the U.S. central bank is seen as the most likely outcome. However, updated dot-plot projections for interest rates and fresh commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell may be a wild card.\n\nAs such, there will be a lot on the line when the Fed's Open Market Committee delivers its monetary policy decision and updated economic projections at 2:00 PM ET on Wednesday.\n\nThe Fed is all but certain to keep the benchmark Fed funds target range between 5.25% and 5.50%, where it has been since July 2023, as policymakers assess signs of a resilient economy, a robust labor market, and elevated inflation.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nFOMC officials will also release their new forecasts for interest rates and economic growth, known as the dot plot, which will reveal greater signs of the Fed's likely rate trajectory through the rest of 2024 and beyond.\n\nIn March, the dot plot indicated that policymakers anticipated three 25-basis point rate cuts by the end of the year. However, the economic landscape has shifted since then.\n\nAll eyes will then turn to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who will hold what will be a closely watched press conference at 2:30 PM ET as investors look for fresh clues on how he views the economy and inflation trends.\n\nWhen Powell last spoke in mid-May, he warned that inflation is falling more slowly than expected and that monetary policy needs to be restrictive for longer.\n\nWhile the Fed is all but certain to remain on hold, investors should brace themselves for a longer wait for rate cuts than previously anticipated despite the CPI report coming in cooler than expected. This is because the economy has held up better than anticipated, and the labor market remains strong.\n\nIn the post-meeting press conference, Chairman Powell is likely to underscore that Fed officials will need to see several more months of low inflation readings before they would consider cutting rates. Meanwhile, updated dot plot projections are expected to indicate a significant change to reflect the Fed's new stance on the latest data.\n\nGiven the proximity of the U.S. presidential election in November, it is increasingly likely that the Fed will avoid initiating a rate-cutting cycle starting in September. The central bank traditionally prefers not to make significant policy shifts close to elections to avoid any perception of political influence.\n\nConsidering the above factors, it appears the Fed might keep borrowing costs higher for longer than markets currently anticipate. This scenario aligns with the Fed's cautious approach to ensure inflation is firmly under control before easing monetary policy.\n\nAs such, December is emerging as the most probable timeline for the start of an easing cycle in my view. Investors should adjust their expectations accordingly, as the central bank navigates these complex economic and political landscapes.\n\nAny indications or shifts in the Fed's tone during the meeting could trigger significant market movements and investor sentiments. Taking that into consideration, market participants are advised to remain vigilant, exercise caution, and diversify portfolios to hedge against potential market fluctuations.\n\nTo navigate the

While the annual CPI increase stands at 3.3%, indicating potential for more rate cuts, the Fed's cautious approach may delay such moves until 2025.\n\nDespite some market participants anticipating rate cuts due to the lighter-than-expected inflation data, Green notes that a single positive data point is unlikely to prompt the Fed to change course. Federal Reserve officials cite the robust labor market as a key factor in maintaining the current rate, contrasting with recent rate cuts by other major central banks such as the Eurozone, Canada, and Mexico.\n\nGreen advises investors to review their strategies and portfolios, considering the impact of the Fed's high rates on sectors like real estate and utilities, which are sensitive to interest rates. As other central banks cut rates, opportunities may arise in international markets, but investors should be wary of currency volatility and consider hedging strategies.\n\nFuture Fed policy will depend on upcoming economic data, particularly related to employment, inflation, and GDP growth. Green concludes that the Fed's likely decision to maintain rates reflects a cautious approach focused on long-term economic stability, contrasting with the recent rate cuts seen in other parts of the world.

Annually, core inflation reached 27.1% in May, down from 31.8% in April.\n\nConsumer prices index (CPI) also saw a monthly decrease of 0.7% in May, a shift from the 1.1% increase observed in April.\n\nCAPMAS highlighted that the CPI for the whole country hit 221.8 points in May 2024, marking a 0.8% decrease from April. This reduction is the first negative movement since June 2022, which saw a 0.3% change.\n\nThe agency attributed this decline to price drops across various food groups: cereals and bread (-2.5%), meat and poultry (-4.6%), fish and seafood (-0.7%), dairy products, cheese, and eggs (-3.9%), oils and fats (-3.0%), vegetables (-8.7%), sugar and sugary foods (-0.6%), other food products (-1.7%), ready meals (-0.5%), hotel services (-0.7%), and personal effects (-0.8%).\n\nConversely, price increases were noted in fruits (+12.4%), coffee, tea, and cocoa (+0.8%), textiles (+1.7%), ready-made garments (+1.7%), shoes (+1.7%), house rent (+0.8%), tobacco (+0.3%), home furnishings (+0.2%), and utilities (+0.6%).\n\nThe overall annual inflation rate for Egypt was recorded at 27.4% for May 2024, a decrease from April's 31.8%.\n\nThe CBE anticipates a significant inflation reduction in the first half of 2025. The latest figures post the extraordinary Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting on March 6 suggest a return to pre-March 2022 inflation rates.\n\nOn 23 May, the MPC maintained the CBE's basic interest rates at 27.25% for deposits, 28.25% for lending, and 27.75% for the main operation, credit, and discount rates, unchanged since the 6% hike in an extraordinary meeting on March 6.\n\nThe next MPC meeting to review these rates is scheduled for July 18.\n\nCBE forecasts a moderation in inflation throughout 2024 due to diminishing inflationary pressures, having peaked earlier. Factors contributing to this expected decline include tighter monetary policy, a unified foreign exchange market, substantial foreign direct investment inflows, an improved external financing environment, and a boost in foreign exchange reserves. Additionally, growing domestic and international demand for Egyptian pound-denominated assets is anticipated.\n\nInflationary pressures have been on a downward trend, with general and core inflation peaking at 38% in September 2023 and 41% in June 2023, respectively. Despite a surprise rise in February 2024, inflation rates have been decreasing, with general and core inflation at 32.5% and 31.8% in April 2024, respectively.\n\nThe base period effect has also played a role in lowering inflation rates in 2024, following periods of high inflation in 2023. The general inflation rate has been primarily driven by food supplies since December 2022, despite a rise in non-food inflation limiting the ongoing decrease in food commodity prices since November 2023.\n\nCBE acknowledges risks to inflation, such as escalating geopolitical tensions, adverse local and global climate conditions, and fiscal control measures.\n\nThe Central Bank affirms its commitment to using all available monetary policy tools to maintain tight monetary conditions, aiming to sustainably reduce monthly inflation rates and achieve medium-term price stability.", "source": {"uri": "dailynewsegypt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News Egypt"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Order of the British Empire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Egypt", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Bank of Egypt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bread"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cereal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_as_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egg as food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_bean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cocoa bean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furniture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Furniture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fruit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cheese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Food_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Food Science", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Consulting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Wholesale_and_Distribution", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Wholesale and Distribution", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://d1b3667xvzs6rz.cloudfront.net/2024/06/\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0636\u062e\u0645_\u0641\u0649_\u0645\u0635\u0631.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-23", "textStart": 1734, "textEnd": 1740}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-06", "textStart": 1670, "textEnd": 1677, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 2028, "textEnd": 2035}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

The Fed has reasoned that it increased interest rates to curb inflation, although inflation climbed exponentially as it did so, critics argue.\n\nBut the 2% inflation goal and \"cooling\" inflation \"trend\" isn't the best context to understand economic health, one national economist argues. Ultimately, \"the trend is not your friend,\" E.J. Antoni, an economist with the Heritage Foundation, said, referring to \"lower inflation.\"\n\n\"Regardless of whatever ... anyone tells you, the numbers clearly show we were never trending towards the 2.0% inflation target, let alone zero, which is where we should be; we've been trending towards 3%+,\" he said in social media posts.\n\n\"A slower increase [in inflation] is still an increase and prices set a new record high,\" he added.\n\nFor homeowners, \"lower inflation\" means \"a monthly mortgage payment on a median price home in May was 119.5% higher than\" it was in January 2021. \"That's almost $14,000 per year, for 30 years, for the same house,\" he said.\n\nFor renters, it means paying sky-high rent. \"Rent continues rocketing higher, now up 21.6% since Jan '21,\" he said, making it \"hard to save for a down payment on a home when your rent is rising almost 10X your income.\"\n\nMore from this section Nearly 50 residents displaced following blaze that destroyed East Windsor condo building Take a look inside Point Defiance's newly renovated aquarium Davey has one advantage in this election but he's careful not to get ahead of himself - analysis by Christopher Hope\n\nJust three months ago, home buyers needed 80% more income to purchase a home than they did in 2020, The Center Square reported, even as median income increased by 23% at the same time.\n\nFor employees, \"lower inflation\" means an hourly wage growth that \"outpaced inflation in May\" but the difference is negligible. Pointing to average hourly earnings since January 2021 from Bureau of Labor Statistics data, he said, \"We're so far behind the nominal increase of the last 3+ years that it's laughable - the difference between real and nominal wages since Jan '21 is $5.65/hr for average worker; that's more than he or she pays in federal income tax.\"\n\n\"Lower inflation\" means average hourly earnings are down by 2.2% and average weekly earnings are down by nearly 4% since January 2021 because of \"the collapse of full-time jobs\" replaced by part-time jobs, he said.\n\nOther economists have also pointed to jobs report discrepancies primarily based on part-time jobs data. They've forecast a recession to hit later this year because the labor market and economy aren't as strong as they seem, The Center Square reported.\n\n\"Lower inflation\" also means energy prices are up an average of 35.6% in less than 3.5 years, with gasoline and diesel up over 40% and 50%, respectively, Antoni said.

So, what is driving inflation in the United States?\n\nThe short answer: A lot of things.\n\nFrom a tight labor market at home to conflict overseas, economic ripple effects from the pandemic are all still alive and well.\n\nWhile the inflation rate so far this year is hovering around 3% -- below what many economists consider a high rate -- it's above the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. Combined with rate hikes beginning in 2021 and inflation reaching a four-decade high in 2022, Americans have felt about a 20% increase over the last four years.\n\nIt's what most of us are feeling when we go to the grocery store, pay our electricity bill or replace an appliance. It's also why when we hear that inflation has slowed, it doesn't feel like it.\n\nMoney\n\nTomas Hoppough\n\n7:21 PM, Apr 12, 2024\n\nAmericans struggling to afford groceries due to increasing prices\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the Consumer Price Index report monthly. That report is largely how we gauge the inflation rate looking at year-over-year price comparisons for almost everything we spend money on.\n\nSo far this year, the categories driving inflation were housing, car insurance and health care. But to get a true sense of what has been driving inflation overall -- not just month to month -- you have to take a step back and look at longer-term trends in context.\n\nOne major influence on inflation is a tight labor market. The unemployment level is low.\n\nAdditionally, there are a lot of open jobs. This, combined with the workers searching for better opportunities while on the job, means companies are offering higher wages to compete for talent.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Center for American Progress, nearly 60% of workers have seen pay increases. Those costs got pushed down the line to consumers.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that pay for private-sector workers increased by 4.1% in 2023, outpacing inflation. However, those increases paled in comparison to the 12.6% average increase in CEO salaries.\n\nSome minimum-wage workers saw increases, too, but not enough to impact inflation rates. A study from the Economic Policy Institute found that minimum wage increases, even if instituted in every state, would have a negligible impact on inflation -- meaning the share of workers in this category is too small to drive up prices.\n\nHousing\n\nDan Grossman\n\n8:23 PM, Feb 13, 2024\n\nWhy are rent and housing prices still so high?\n\nAnother factor that affects inflation is strong demand for durable goods like appliances and cars meeting with supply chain issues at the start of the pandemic. Consumer demands shifted, nearly overnight, from services to goods. We were buying more stuff and going out less.\n\nAfter lockdowns were lifted, this dynamic abruptly shifted again, and some supply chain issues were resolved. Now we're seeing the prices of durable goods going down and services going up.\n\nToday, new supply chain issues have been mounting. Some of those include the drought in the Panama Canal, the collapse of the key bridge in Baltimore, and attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea.\n\nAnother conflict impacting inflation: Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nThe price of food and energy went up in the U.S. and abroad as both countries' outputs dropped, due in part to sanctions on Russia that triggered inflationary rates in many countries.\n\nHowever, there is some good news: Consumer inflation is trending downward.\n\nWhile we aren't likely to see prices drop to pre-pandemic levels, at least they are projected to keep spiking at the same rate.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

Increased money supply to prevent financial crises typically precedes inflation spikes. The pandemic's massive liquidity injection led to inflation in 2022, aggravated by the Russia/Ukraine war.\n\nWe've seen the word hyperinflation tossed around a bit recently. We've also seen the word depression tossed around, but more often than not it is hyperinflation that is mentioned. However, there is also inflationary depression, meaning a period of severe economic contraction accompanied by high inflation. The worst of both worlds. One could say that the hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic in Germany in 1923 also contributed to a collapse in economic activity and rising unemployment. In other words, an inflationary depression.\n\nAs bad as Germany's inflation was, it wasn't the worst of the 20th century. That honour belongs to post-World War II Hungary where inflation reached the unlikely, unheard-of level of 41.9 quadrillion % in July 1946 -- effectively a doubling of prices every 15.3 hours. It seems that even the inflation in Zimbabwe fell below the Hungary inflation. The worst inflation registered today is Argentina where it was last reported at 289% annually. Makes the U.S. and Canada's last reported inflation of 3.5% and 2.7% look rather puny. Grant you, that is just the headline inflation rate. John Williams of ShadowStats (www.shadowstats.com) reports U.S. inflation at 11.4%. Maybe that's why so many are feeling the pinch. It's reported officially as 3.5%, but reality has it at 11.4%.\n\nIn U.S. history, periods of high inflation are usually marked by periods of war, both during and after. Inflation rose during the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783), the War of 1812 (1812-1815), the U.S. Civil War (1861-1865), World War I (1914-1918), World War II (1939-1945), Korean War (1950-1953), Vietnam War (1955-1975), the 1970s oil shock (1970-1980), the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and Desert Storm (1990-1991), rising gas prices in the 2000s due to sharply increased demand in Asia, particularly China (2000-2008), and the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq (2001-2021). Today's rise in inflation generally coincided with the outbreak of the Russia/Ukraine War, followed by the Israel/Hamas War. But the conditions were set before the outbreak of war.\n\nUsually accompanying a rise in inflation is a rise in money supply (M1, M2) as the Fed and other central banks flood the financial system with liquidity to prevent a financial meltdown. The trouble is, it has taken an increasing amount of money to purchase an additional dollar of GDP. The chart below shows that periods of inflation are generally preceded by a rise in money supply (M1, M2). This is not always the case, as the jump in money supply after the dot.com crash in 2000-2002 resulted mostly in benign inflation as did the jump in money supply after the financial crisis of 2007-2009.\n\nHowever, the massive injection of liquidity after the pandemic of 2020-2021 did result in a jump in inflation, starting in 2022. Was it just coincidence that the Russia/Ukraine war also got underway in 2022? The Russia/Ukraine war broke out in February and the first rate hike was in March 2022. The outbreak of war resulted in more expenditures from the U.S. treasury to finance Ukraine in its war against Russia and Israel in its war with Hamas. Generally, however, a rise in money supply (some call it money printing) is generally followed by a rise in inflation.\n\nIn 2020, at the height of the pandemic, the U.S. had the highest budget deficit ever at $4.2 trillion. It represented 14.7% of GDP. That percentage of GDP was surpassed by wartime budget deficits that reached 26.9% of GDP in 1943. In 1943 it really was war. War and budget deficits are not unusual. But it took a pandemic to reach the highest budget deficit ever.\n\nFour years after the pandemic budget deficit, the U.S. budget deficit in 2024 is expected to reach at least $1.8 trillion and as high as $2.0 trillion. The combination of budget deficits and rising money supply is directly correlated to a rise in inflation -- too much money sloshing around. But inflation is not necessarily always price inflation. It is also asset inflation as money was poured into the stock market and the housing market, thanks, as well, to ultra-low interest rates. This is what took place after the 2008 financial crisis and was accelerated after the pandemic.\n\nRising inflation is eventually followed by rising interest rates as the monetary authorities try to dampen inflation. But fiscal spending is the responsibility of the treasury. The result is the two can actually work against each other, irrespective of how high the monetary authorities (Fed, BofC, ECB, etc.) hike interest rates to combat inflation. No wonder there are those that say Western economies are on an unsustainable path. In the event of another 2008 financial crisis, we might no longer have bail-outs, but instead bail-ins.\n\nThe authorities are trapped as any massive turn-off of the fiscal spigots could result in rising unemployment and falling GDP. It's how a recession could turn into a depression. Add in the rise of sanctions and trade tariffs that are beginning to predominate, no matter who is in charge, and we could have a deadly combination that sparks a sharp downturn, resulting in falling currencies. Falling currencies of the fiat kind are often accompanied by increased inflation. Nor does it necessarily signal the end of inflation, although inflation did fall and turn negative during the Great Depression.\n\nGold and inflation are often linked. The correlation is supposed to be that as inflation rises gold rises as well. Gold, is therefore, known as an inflation hedge. Inflation also means a decline in the value of fiat currencies. Gold (and silver) are proven to be money throughout the centuries. But that positive correlation between gold and inflation works best when inflation is rising sharply. When inflation subsides, gold often falls as well.\n\nDuring the inflationary 1970s, as the CPI rose gold rose as well. But from around 1980 to 2001, inflation subsided and gold went through a long period of underperformance. That perked up in the 2000s as inflation picked up and gold once again soared. But once again, when inflation subsided through the 2010s, the price of gold also slumped.\n\nGold is also correlated to the debt and money supply. As debt increases and as the money supply increases (M1, M2), gold tends to rise as well. Despite the positive links for gold to inflation, money supply, and debt, the inflation-adjusted price of gold remains below its peak seen in 1980. Gold today would have to rise above $2,700 to equal the highs of 1980 on an inflation-adjusted basis. With silver, the spread is even more as silver would have to rise to $144-$150 to equal the 1980 high. Yet gold has helped maintain purchasing power, even as currencies fall, debt rises, money supply rises, and inflation rises.\n\nIt seems strange to note that gold in 1971, before the closing of the gold window, was trading at $42/ounce. Today that would be only $325. Gold today is trading around $2,325. Since 2000, gold has been the best-performing asset (setting aside Bitcoin and cryptos), with a gain of 720%. Closest is silver, up 451%. The S&P 500 is up only 265% and the TSX even less, up 163%. The same holds true from 1970 where gold is up 6,672% vs. the S&P 500 up 5,715%. The big winner, however, is the NASDAQ that has gained 16,426%. Today, gold is under-owned and unloved, except, of course, in Asia or by the central banks -- both have been buying gold. For whatever reason, gold does not hold the same cachet in North America as it does in Asia, particularly India and China.\n\nWestern economies have no history of hyperinflation, outside of the previously mentioned hyperinflation that occurred after World War I in Germany and France as well. It is amazing how the German mark went from one mark to purchase one gold mark in 1918 to needing one trillion marks in 1923. No wonder they needed barrels of money just to purchase a loaf of bread. But what was most interesting about the German hyperinflation is that purchasing an ounce of gold in 1918 would have been more than sufficient to maintain purchasing power. Gold is a hedge against inflation. But, as with anything, there is a time to own it and a time not to.\n\nWith gold, we are referring to bars, coins, etc. Gold stocks offer leverage, but like all stocks they have their own liability. Eventually the under-owned and more unloved junior resource exploration stocks will wake up. They offer the most leverage to the price of gold (and other commodities). With ongoing deterioration in geopolitics, domestic politics, money printing, debt accumulation, and climate disasters, gold will eventually prove its mettle. And, unlike cryptos, gold is real, not virtual.\n\nWell, so much for rate cuts in the U.S. The nonfarm payrolls completely surprised everyone, reporting 272,000 new jobs in April when the consensus was for only 180,000/190,000. So, what happened? The stock market wobbled, bond yields rose, the US$ Index rose sharply, oil rose, and gold and other commodities were clobbered.\n\nBut as we always say -- hold on a minute. There are some unanswered questions (and, no, we don't have an answer, either), like, how could the nonfarm payrolls rise so much (+272,000) when the civilian labour force fell 250,000? Not rise, the civilian labour force fell. Yet the eligible working population rose by 182,000, but then we look over at the not in the labour force category and it also rose by 433,000.\n\nThe civilian employment level as reported by households fell an astounding 408,000. None of this, as we say, equates. Grant you, there are two different surveys as nonfarm payrolls is the establishment survey (Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS) to business directly), whereas the other numbers are the household survey (BLS to individual households).\n\nThe labour force participation rate also fell to 62.5% vs. 62.7% in April. Also, the employment population ratio dropped to 60.1% from 60.2%. More jobs, but fewer people participating in the labour market. That's a headscratcher. But what about those jobs? Full-time employment fell 625,000, but part-time employment rose 286,000. The employment level, meaning all those eligible to be employed, as noted also fell by 408,000.\n\nThe unemployment rate (U3) rose to 4.0% from 3.9%. However, the U6 unemployment rate (U3 plus all persons marginally attached to the labor force, plus total employed part time for economic reasons, as a percent of the civilian labor force, plus all persons marginally attached to the labor force) was unchanged at 7.2%. At time of writing we didn't have the Shadow Stats www.shadowstats.com numbers.\n\nEarlier in the week, the weekly claims were reported as 229,000, up from 221,000 the previous week and above the consensus of 220,000. The ADP employment was up 152,000, below the expected 170,000 and April's 188,000. Grant you, ADP employment and nonfarm payrolls rarely agree month to month but over time tend to equal out.\n\nSo, where were all the jobs? Mostly in health care, government, and leisure and hospitality. Private nonfarm was up 229,000 while government nonfarm was up 43,000. Earnings rose more than expected, up 0.4% on the month above the expected 0.2% and year over year (y-o-y) up 4.1% vs. expected 3.9%. But we note that average number of weeks unemployed rose to 21.2 weeks, up from 19.9 weeks. And those unemployed 27 weeks or longer rose by 62,000. However, the median weeks unemployed fell to 9.3 weeks from 10.5 weeks.\n\nThe unemployment rate of 4% is the highest in since November 2021 but remains at historically low levels. According to the household survey, the cohort 16-25 saw job losses but the core 25-54 age group saw gains. Also, the core 25-54 age group had the highest labour force participation rate in 22 years at 83.6%.\n\nThe report sounds rosy. But dig deeper and suddenly it is not so rosy. As usual, there are discrepancies between the two surveys that don't add up. So, what does it mean? Well, it will keep interest rates up. The odds of a Fed rate cut at the June 11-12 meeting is about zero. The next meeting is July 30-31. At this point, calling for a rate cut then also seems remote.\n\nAccording to Fed futures, all they are indicating now is one rate cut later this year. So, the likelihood that the Fed will follow the Bank of Canada (BofC) and the European Central Bank (ECB) in cutting rates, as both did this past week, has fallen off dramatically. All in all, good for fixed income investors, bad for borrowers; i.e. households, corporations, government. And, at least for the moment, bad for precious metals investors.\n\nCanada surprised with its job numbers as well, although not quite as dramatically as the U.S. In May, Canada gained 26,700 jobs, down sharply from the gonzo April number of 90,400 but still above expectations of 22,500 new jobs. But, as usual, suspicious numbers. Part-time employment rose by 62,000 jobs, but full-time employment fell by 36,000. The number of people unemployed rose by 28,100, even as employed persons also rose by 73,200. The unemployment rate rose to 6.2% from 6.1% (it's different than the U.S. unemployment rate as it is calculated differently). The R8 unemployment number, the highest calculated by Statistics Canada (www.statcan.gc.ca) (plus discouraged searchers, waiting group, portion of involuntary part-timers) rose to 8.5% from 8.4%.\n\nThe labour force participation rate remained the same at 65.4%. Average hourly earnings rose by $1.77 while average weekly earnings were up $6.2. Average hourly earnings were up 5.2% year over year (y-o-y) vs. 4.8% in April. As with the U.S., most of the jobs were in health care and leisure and hospitality.\n\nOnce again, new all-time highs happened in the stock market. Well, at least for some. Not everyone joined the party and others, rather than rising on the week, fell instead. Making new all-time highs were the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ. The NASDAQ was pushed by the FAANGs as the NY FANG Index also made new all-time highs, despite only one FAANG of significance making new all-time highs. Yes, that would be Nvidia that is pushing Apple as the second largest corporation in the world. Microsoft leads with a market cap of $3.15 trillion, Apple with $3.02 trillion, and Nvidia with $2.97 trillion. These companies are so big they pale most countries. All three rank with the U.K., the world's sixth largest economy. They'd be number 6, 8, and 9 if they were countries.\n\nNonetheless, divergences are popping up everywhere, it seems. On the week, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 1.3% but the Dow Jones Industrials (DJI) failed to make new all-time highs, up 0.3%. The DJI is down 3.2% from its all-time high. The Dow Jones Transportations (DJT) continues to diverge widely with the DJI and fell on the week, losing 1.4%.\n\nAs noted, the NASDAQ made all-time highs, up 2.4%, and the NY FANG Index gained 3.0% to new all-time highs. The S&P 400 (Mid) fell 2.1% while the S&P 600 (Small) was also down, off 2.5%. More telling was the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index that also fell off 0.8%. Unlike its weighted partner, the SPXEW is down 3.4% from its March 2024 all-time high. Divergences.\n\nAnother way of looking at divergences is the NYSE Advance/Decline line. Even as the SPX was making all-time highs, the NYSE AD Line was not making new highs. The last time we saw that was late 2021. What followed was the 20%+ decline in 2022. Divergences.\n\nAs well, numerous indicators, including the RSI, MACD, and more, are diverging on a daily (short-term), weekly (intermediate term), and even monthly (long-term) basis. None of that is a positive sign as we head towards the second half of the year. The one positive is that usually in an election year the stock market does well. But, given the current deep divisions in the country before the November election, even that is not guaranteed.\n\nFriday's action on the SPX left it with what we call in Japanese candlestick terms an evening star. That's a longish body with a small real body. It usually looks like a small cross. On Friday, the SPX opened at 5,344, hit a high of 5,375, a low of 5,331, and closed at 5,346. A range of 44 points but only 2 points separated the open from the close. It's a potentially bearish sign. We'll see what happens in the coming weeks.\n\nIn Canada, the TSX Composite fell 1.2% and the TSX Venture Exchange (CDNX) continued its woes, down 3.7%. Seven sub-indices were down, led by Energy (TEN), down 5.9%, six were up, led by Consumer Staples (TCS), up 2.4%, and one was flat -- Consumer Discretionary (TCD). In the EU, the London FTSE fell 0.4%, the EuroNext gained about 0.7%, the Paris CAC 40 was up 0.1%, and the German DAX gained 0.3%.\n\nIn Asia, China's Shanghai Index (SSEC) was down about 1.2%, the Tokyo Nikkei Dow (TKN) was up 0.5%, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) was down 0.3%. The MSCI World Index gained 1.8%, suggesting that gains were in emerging markets. Bitcoin jumped 2.2% but remains below $70,000 and its all-time high.\n\nDivergences, divergences everywhere. This is leading us to believe that we may be witnessing a top. Confirmation would come when the SPX breaks under 5,200. Better confirmation comes with a break under 5,000. The S&P 500 and the stock market in general is still overvalued with P/E multiples well above the long-term mean and median. Price to sales is also well above its long-term mean and median while the earnings yield remains well below its long-term mean and median.\n\nAt this point we can't confirm a top. We await better signals.\n\nFriday, June 7 almost had the feel of Friday, April 12, 2013. On that day, gold plunged $80. On Monday, April 15, 2013 it got even worse as gold was slaughtered, falling $129. Two days that will live in gold infamy. Two days and gold fell $209. The gold crash of 2013 is etched in gold bugs' minds. Percentage-wise, the plunge on April 12 was 5%. The two-day plunge was just over 13%. On Friday, June 7 gold fell $65 in the futures market. In the cash market that continued trading after futures closed, gold closed down $83. But the drop in the futures was only 2.8%. Still, it all came as a bit of a shock. In 2013, the market was already sliding and when key support at $1,500/$1,525 gave way it was turned into a rout.\n\nArguably, the conditions that were present in 2013 are not here today. Friday's plunge was triggered by the stronger than expected nonfarm payrolls. As a result, bond yields rise and thoughts of a Fed rate cut this coming week went up in smoke. The headline nonfarm might have been have seemed rosy, but a closer examination, as we note in our commentary on the U.S. job numbers, was that the numbers actually revealed rot.\n\nThe employment level fell by 408,000, making the nonfarm gain of 272,000 seem suspect. Full-time jobs plunged 625,000 while part-time jobs jumped 286,000. The unemployment rate rose. Bond yields did rise Friday, but on the week, they were actually lower. The US$ Index jumped, but ended the week rather flat.\n\nNaturally, a breakdown under $2,300 might send us tumbling further to support near $2,200 or even $2,100. That would still leave gold up on the year, albeit damaged. The thought behind Friday's plunge was that, given the strong job numbers, a Fed rate cut was off the table and the Fed would not be joining the BofC and the ECB in cutting rates. It's misplaced, as elsewhere we are seeing signs of a slowing economy. Then there is the astronomical debt, the geopolitical concerns, domestic political dysfunction, and weakening fiat currencies. All are music to gold's ears.\n\nOn the week, gold fell 0.9%, largely because of a strong two-day rally the two previous days to Friday. Silver was dumped under $30, losing 3.3%, while platinum was clobbered, down 6.8%. Of the near precious metals, palladium actually gained, up 1.2%, while copper, which is in increasingly short supply coupled with increased demand, fell 2.6%. The key gold stock indices that were seriously clobbered on Friday ended the week in the red with the Gold Bugs Index (HUI) down 5.8% and the TSX Gold Index (TGD) down 4.0%. The junior exploration stocks that are already under-owned and unloved remained in that sorry state.\n\nWe've continually noted that gold is typically weak in May/June. This year appears to be no exception. The question is, when will it bottom and how low will we go? A bottom could be formed as early as this coming week, but we suspect no later than the first week of July. Gold could still fall further to no worse than $2,100, but a test under $2,300 would not be surprising. Silver has plunged under $30, the previous breakout point, but as a worst case we believe $28 should hold. Gold needs to regain $2,400 to suggest a low is in and silver above $32.\n\nCycles remain positive. The last major low was October 2022 at $1,618. That low fit well with our 7.8-year cycle (+/- 8 months) that previously bottomed in December 2015. The cycle turned up when gold broke above $2,100 the previous high. If that is correct, then the next cycle low is not due until sometime in 2029-2031. A shorter 31-month cycle saw a low in August 2018 which was 32 months from the December 2015 low.\n\nThe next low of significance was a possible double bottom low in March 2021 and August 2021 (31 months and 36 months from the 2018 low). Yes, the October 2022 low was even lower, but instead that may have been a half-cycle low. Using the 2021 lows, the next 31-month cycle low is due October 2023. Sure enough, there was a low that month. We may have already seen our 31-month cycle low. The next one isn't due until around May 2026.\n\nGold closed under the 50-day MA on Friday. As noted, there is trendline support at $2,300, but the 100-day MA support is down closer to $2,200. If we break $2,300, then the odds increase that we could test $2,200. Silver confirmed a breakout when it closed over $30. So, this appears to be test of the breakout zone. But a test of the 50-day MA near $28.70 can't be ruled out. The gold stock indices need to see the HUI break above 300 and the TGD above 340 to suggest we are headed higher.\n\nThe HUI is showing support at 260, but next good support doesn't come until 250. Similarly, the TGD is testing support at 310, but next good support doesn't come in until 290. The miserable junior gold mining exploration stocks continue to overwhelmed by preferred speculation in cryptos as funds pour into the Bitcoin ETF. Yet many of these juniors are undervalued, given their potential and resources. Majors need new product and many of the juniors are potential takeover targets, but at much higher prices.\n\nOil continues to be somewhat oversupplied, despite continued cuts by OPEC+. Russia is finding ways of getting its oil to market. The ECB rate cut helped, but Friday's nonfarm helped dampen thoughts of the Fed following until at least September. On the week, WTI oil fell 1.9% and Brent crude was down 2.7%.\n\nNatural gas(NG) continues to be positive as we go into the summer with NG at the Henry Hub gaining 12.7% as the EU NG at the Dutch Hub fell 4.1%. The energy stocks had a poor week, with the ARCA Oil & Gas Index (XOI) down 4.0% and the TSX Energy Index (TEN) off 5.9%. Seasonally, oil tends to be weak as we move into summer.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This article was written by a third party contributor and does not reflect the opinion of Born2Invest, its management, staff or its associates.

Official figures from the regulator show that in May 2023, lending rates at banks averaged 20.1% before falling to 16.7% in December. In April 2024, the average interest rate was 17.7%.\n\nDespite the fear of spiralling inflation, BoU says that this is still very high. Recently, manufacturers were supported by David Bahati, the Minister of State for Industry, that commercial banks should be lending at a maximum of 14%, which is also the average in the region.\n\nPresident Yoweri Museveni also said something about interest rates during the State of the Nation Address: \"I have already directed the Minister of Finance to cap the interest rates chargeable by money lenders. The inflation rate in Uganda is 3%. Why should the commercial banks charge 20% interest? How about the money lenders charging 36% or more?\"\n\nCBR kept unchanged\n\nMeanwhile, the Bank of Uganda opted to keep the Central Bank Rate at a high 10.25% for the next two months, following a renewed rise in inflation.\n\nThe CBR is an indicative interest rate that the Central Bank uses to influence the cost of money, either upwards or downwards, depending mainly, on the need to regulate the amount of money in circulation.\n\nA high inflation rate leads to high prices for the final consumer of the locally produced goods but also favours borrowers who pay back a lesser value than they borrowed. It may also discourage new investments due to the anticipated low profitability of the business as the value of the local currency falls.\n\nFor these and more reasons, the Central Bank maintains the inflation rate with an acceptable target, which for Uganda, is 5%. At the end of May 2024, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBoS) reported that annual headline inflation had risen to 3.6%, having risen to 3.2% a month earlier.\n\nAlthough this rate is still the lowest in eastern Africa, the Bank of Uganda is not risking to see it go out of hand. The rise in inflation is mainly attributed to rising healthcare, education, and transportation service costs, coupled with higher prices for solid and liquid fuels.\n\nWhile services inflation rose to a high 6.5%, the most price increases were recorded in electricity, fuel, and utilities from 7.4 at the end of April to 9.5% by the end of May, largely due to high global prices and the depreciation of the shilling early in the month.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.ug", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent Uganda:"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Atingi-Ego", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Atingi-Ego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Uganda", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Uganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commercial bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exchange rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kampala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kampala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kampala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Finance_(Canada)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Finance (Canada)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bahati", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Bahati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoweri_Museveni", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yoweri Museveni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shilling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda_Bureau_of_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uganda Bureau of Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.independent.co.ug/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Atingi-Ego-1-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

(Scripps News)\n\nIt's no secret our paychecks are buying less, and coming into an election year, the economy is likely to be a deciding issue for many voters. So, what is driving inflation in the United States?\n\nThe short answer: A lot of things.\n\nFrom a tight labor market at home to conflict overseas, economic ripple effects from the pandemic are all still alive and well.\n\nWhile the inflation rate so far this year is hovering around 3% -- below what many economists consider a high rate -- it's above the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. Combined with rate hikes beginning in 2021 and inflation reaching a four-decade high in 2022, Americans have felt about a 20% increase over the last four years.\n\nIt's what most of us are feeling when we go to the grocery store, pay our electricity bill or replace an appliance. It's also why when we hear that inflation has slowed, it doesn't feel like it.\n\nMoney\n\nAmericans struggling to afford groceries due to increasing prices Tomas Hoppough 4:21 PM, Apr 12, 2024\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the Consumer Price Index report monthly. That report is largely how we gauge the inflation rate looking at year-over-year price comparisons for almost everything we spend money on.\n\nSo far this year, the categories driving inflation were housing, car insurance and health care. But to get a true sense of what has been driving inflation overall -- not just month to month -- you have to take a step back and look at longer-term trends in context.\n\nOne major influence on inflation is a tight labor market. The unemployment level is low.\n\nAdditionally, there are a lot of open jobs. This, combined with the workers searching for better opportunities while on the job, means companies are offering higher wages to compete for talent.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Center for American Progress, nearly 60% of workers have seen pay increases. Those costs got pushed down the line to consumers.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that pay for private-sector workers increased by 4.1% in 2023, outpacing inflation. However, those increases paled in comparison to the 12.6% average increase in CEO salaries.\n\nSome minimum-wage workers saw increases, too, but not enough to impact inflation rates. A study from the Economic Policy Institute found that minimum wage increases, even if instituted in every state, would have a negligible impact on inflation -- meaning the share of workers in this category is too small to drive up prices.\n\nHousing\n\nWhy are rent and housing prices still so high? Dan Grossman 5:23 PM, Feb 13, 2024\n\nAnother factor that affects inflation is strong demand for durable goods like appliances and cars meeting with supply chain issues at the start of the pandemic. Consumer demands shifted, nearly overnight, from services to goods. We were buying more stuff and going out less.\n\nAfter lockdowns were lifted, this dynamic abruptly shifted again, and some supply chain issues were resolved. Now we're seeing the prices of durable goods going down and services going up.\n\nToday, new supply chain issues have been mounting. Some of those include the drought in the Panama Canal, the collapse of the key bridge in Baltimore, and attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea.\n\nAnother conflict impacting inflation: Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nThe price of food and energy went up in the U.S. and abroad as both countries' outputs dropped, due in part to sanctions on Russia that triggered inflationary rates in many countries.\n\nHowever, there is some good news: Consumer inflation is trending downward.\n\nWhile we aren't likely to see prices drop to pre-pandemic levels, at least they are projected to keep spiking at the same rate.", "source": {"uri": "10news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KGTV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_glenfield@10news.com", "name": "Jennifer Glenfield", "type": "author",

Annually, core inflation reached 27.1% in May, down from 31.8% in April.\n\nConsumer prices index (CPI) also saw a monthly decrease of 0.7% in May, a shift from the 1.1% increase observed in April.\n\nCAPMAS highlighted that the CPI for the whole country hit 221.8 points in May 2024, marking a 0.8% decrease from April. This reduction is the first negative movement since June 2022, which saw a 0.3% change.\n\nThe agency attributed this decline to price drops across various food groups: cereals and bread (-2.5%), meat and poultry (-4.6%), fish and seafood (-0.7%), dairy products, cheese, and eggs (-3.9%), oils and fats (-3.0%), vegetables (-8.7%), sugar and sugary foods (-0.6%), other food products (-1.7%), ready meals (-0.5%), hotel services (-0.7%), and personal effects (-0.8%).\n\nConversely, price increases were noted in fruits (+12.4%), coffee, tea, and cocoa (+0.8%), textiles (+1.7%), ready-made garments (+1.7%), shoes (+1.7%), house rent (+0.8%), tobacco (+0.3%), home furnishings (+0.2%), and utilities (+0.6%).\n\nThe overall annual inflation rate for Egypt was recorded at 27.4% for May 2024, a decrease from April's 31.8%.\n\nThe CBE anticipates a significant inflation reduction in the first half of 2025. The latest divs post the extraordinary Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting on March 6 suggest a return to pre-March 2022 inflation rates.\n\nOn 23 May, the MPC maintained the CBE's basic interest rates at 27.25% for deposits, 28.25% for lending, and 27.75% for the main operation, credit, and discount rates, unchanged since the 6% hike in an extraordinary meeting on March 6.\n\nThe next MPC meeting to review these rates is scheduled for July 18.\n\nCBE forecasts a moderation in inflation throughout 2024 due to diminishing inflationary pressures, having peaked earlier. Factors contributing to this expected decline include tighter monetary policy, a unified foreign exchange market, substantial foreign direct investment inflows, an improved external financing environment, and a boost in foreign exchange reserves. Additionally, growing domestic and international demand for Egyptian pound-denominated assets is anticipated.\n\nInflationary pressures have been on a downward trend, with general and core inflation peaking at 38% in September 2023 and 41% in June 2023, respectively. Despite a surprise rise in February 2024, inflation rates have been decreasing, with general and core inflation at 32.5% and 31.8% in April 2024, respectively.\n\nThe base period effect has also played a role in lowering inflation rates in 2024, following periods of high inflation in 2023. The general inflation rate has been primarily driven by food supplies since December 2022, despite a rise in non-food inflation limiting the ongoing decrease in food commodity prices since November 2023.\n\nCBE acknowledges risks to inflation, such as escalating geopolitical tensions, adverse local and global climate conditions, and fiscal control measures.\n\nThe Central Bank of Egypt affirms its commitment to using all available monetary policy tools to maintain tight monetary conditions, aiming to sustainably reduce monthly inflation rates and achieve medium-term price stability.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Daily News Egypt.

The S&P 500 was 0.9% higher Wednesday afternoon after rising as much as 1.3% earlier following a surprisingly encouraging report on inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was close to flat, while the Nasdaq composite was up 1.6%. Treasury yields remained lower after the Fed indicated most of its policymakers still expect to cut interest rates at some point this year. A report on Wednesday raised hopes for such a move after showing a slowdown in inflation during May.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks are jumping amid a worldwide rally Wednesday following a surprisingly encouraging update on inflation.\n\nThe S&P 500 was 1.1% higher in afternoon trading and on track to add to its all-time high set a day earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 57 points, or 0.2%, as of 1:11 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.8% higher.\n\nThe action was even stronger in the bond market, where Treasury yields tumbled after the report showed U.S. consumers paid prices that were 3.3% higher for food, insurance and everything else last month, versus a year earlier. Economists had been expecting to see the inflation rate stuck at 3.4%.\n\nFor Wall Street, a slowdown in inflation not only helps U.S. households struggling to keep up with fast-rising prices, it also opens the door for the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate. Such a move would ease pressure on the economy and give a boost to investment prices.\n\nEverything from bitcoin to gold to copper rallied after the inflation data raised expectations for coming cuts to interest rates. A measure of nervousness among investors in U.S. stocks also eased.\n\nVirtually no one expects the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates at its latest meeting, which is scheduled to end Wednesday afternoon. The Fed has been adamant that it needs an accumulation of data showing inflation is sustainably heading toward its 2% target.\n\n\"This is good news, but we will need more of it,\" according to Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing within Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\n\nBut it's welcome news after progress on bringing inflation down seemed to stall early this year. Some stronger-than-expected reports recently on the job market also raised worries about upward pressure remaining on inflation. Of course, too quick a slowdown in inflation could also raise worries that spending by U.S. consumers is falling off too sharply, which could lead to a recession.\n\nBets among traders built for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates as soon as September, according to data from CME Group.\n\nThat had areas of the stock market that tend to benefit most from lower interest rates doing the best amid a widespread rally.\n\nSmaller companies that need to borrow to grow and feel the pinch of higher interest rates more than their larger rivals were leading the market. The smaller stocks in the Russell 2000 index jumped 2.6%.\n\nReal-estate stocks were also shooting higher. Lower interest rates mean bonds are paying less in interest, which can send potential investors to dividend-paying real-estate owners instead. Office owner Boston Properties jumped 4.8%.\n\nLower interest rates could also pull down mortgage rates and inject energy into the housing market. Homebuilder D.R. Horton climbed 4.8%.\n\nOracle helped lead Wall Street higher with a jump of 12.1% even though it reported weaker profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Financial analysts pointed to strong bookings, including contracts related to artificial-intelligence training.\n\nA furor around AI has helped send stocks to records despite worries about high interest rates and the slowdown in the economy that they induce. Nvidia again was one of the strongest forces pushing the S&P 500 higher, with a gain of 4.4%. The chip company has become the poster child of the AI rush, and its total market value has topped $3 trillion.\n\nThe only company to push more on the S&P 500 than Nvidia was Apple, which jumped 4.4%. Its stock has been jumping the last two days after getting a cool initial reception to the announcement of several AI-related offerings coming to its operating systems.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.26% from 4.40% late Monday and from 4.60% a couple weeks ago. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, slumped to 4.68% from 4.83% late Monday.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, European indexes jumped following the release of the encouraging U.S. inflation data. In Asia, where markets closed before the data came out, indexes were mixed. Japan's Nikkei 225 index lost 0.7% as investors wait for the Bank of Japan's latest announcement on interest rates due Friday.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach

The interest rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee has been meeting for two days, to debate whether or not to lower interest rates.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will address the media later in the day.

Monthly inflation was flat, defying an expected 0.1% rise, with annual inflation at 3.3%, slightly below forecasts. Core inflation, excluding food and energy, increased by 0.2% for the month and 3.4% year-over-year, both below projections. This unexpected dip in inflation has raised hopes for potential rate cuts starting in September, now predicted with over a 70% chance, up from 54% prior to the CPI release. Consequently, futures surged: the Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq rose by 0.64%, 0.71%, and 0.78%, respectively. Analysts noted this lower inflation trend surprised the market, lifting futures and lowering the 10-year Treasury note yield.\n\nFalling inflation has injected optimism into the market, boosting futures and pushing yields lower. Key tech stocks like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Nvidia saw premarket gains between 0.7% and 1.8% thanks to declining Treasury yields. Meanwhile, Apple's shares dipped 0.6%, impacting its previously record-high valuation despite new AI features. Still, Apple's market cap stands at an impressive $3.18 trillion, surpassing Nvidia. Elsewhere, Oracle shares jumped 7.2% after projecting double-digit revenue growth for fiscal 2025, while Nio fell 1.1% amid reports of potential EU tariffs on Chinese EVs.\n\nThe bigger picture: A favorable shift for the Fed.\n\nCooling inflation could benefit the Federal Reserve as it prepares for a policy announcement and updated economic projections. A CFRA Research strategist noted the inflation trend aids the Fed, lifting futures and reducing the 10-year note yield. As global economic eyes turn to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, investors hope benign inflation data will pave the way for potential rate cuts later this year.

Core CPI, which excludes the volatile energy and food prices, slowed to 3.4 percent as it increased by lower than expected 0.2 percent for the month. In April, that data point had hit 3.6 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nBorrowing costs across the economy shot up after the Federal Reserve hiked rates at an aggressive pace starting two years ago to battle soaring inflation that at one point rose to its highest level in 40 years. Mortgage rates have gone up since then and currently sit at around 7 percent, double where it was only four years ago.\n\nMay's inflation suggests that price increases had softened in the month and the market's immediate reaction was welcoming. The 10-year treasury yield, which mortgage rates tend to follow, fell on the news of cooling inflation, which economists suggest could spur a decline in borrowing costs.\n\n\"Absolutely possible. Today's CPI reading was pretty good around the board,\" Danielle Hale, Realtor.com's chief economist, told Newsweek.\n\nHale noted that the fall in the 10-year yield could shape the trajectory of mortgage rates. As of 9.54 a.m. EST, it had dropped by more than 10 basis points, according to Yahoo Finance, down close to 2.8 percent from where it opened.\n\n\"You know, we could see that reflected in mortgage rates, they could drop by a similar magnitude,\" Hale said.\n\nMortgage rates had fallen to the mid-6 percent by the end of 2023 and to start the year after rising to the highest levels since the start of the century in the fall of last year on the back of cooling inflation that created expectations that the Federal Reserve would begin slashing rates.\n\nBut price increases in the first quarter of 2024 dampened prospects of cuts in borrowing costs as central bank policymakers suggested that they needed more confidence that inflation was on a consistent move toward their target of 2 percent before they could kick-start a reduction in rates. That helped push mortgage rates up again to near and around 7 percent.\n\n\"Between falling energy prices, and relatively little change in food prices, we've gotten some long-awaited better news on inflation,\" Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, told Newsweek. \"The Federal Reserve doesn't yet have full confidence that inflation is coming down closer to its 2 percent target. But it can see a possible path how to get there.\"\n\nHamrick suggested that CPI and the upcoming producer prices data will suggest there was progress on inflation.\n\n\"There's a lot of data yet to digest before we get there, but the odds currently favor a cut in benchmark rates when the Fed meets in September, with a meeting scheduled before that in late July,\" he said. \"If it happens, that will dampen economic headwinds ever so slightly, including a modest reduction in borrowing costs.\"\n\nFederal Reserve policymakers have been meeting this week and are scheduled to provide an update on interest rates. Analysts expect that the central bank is set to keep rates unchanged at their current two-decade high of 5.25 to 5.5 percent range for the seventh time in a row.\n\nBut some economists suggest that May's inflation reading suggests it was time for the Fed to cut rates.\n\n\"What it should mean is that the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates,\" Bilal Baydoun, Groundwork Collaborative's director of policy and research, told Newsweek. \"I mean, they had forecasted 3 cuts this year and I don't see a reason to keep searching for data that isn't going to come in part because the high interest rate environment is strangling the housing market.\"\n\nHigh borrowing costs have made the housing market unaffordable for a significant chunk of Americans, Baydoun said.\n\n\"Mortgage lock-in, where people don't want to sell their homes because they have a better rate, that's I think the highest it's been in a quarter century,\" he told Newsweek. \"So all of these factors really do the opposite of bringing down costs.\"\n\nLowering interest rates would help bring down the cost of home building and contribute to more supply of houses available in the market whose low inventory has contributed to a jump in prices, Baydoun added.\n\n\"We have an affordability crisis I think in housing that the Fed is effectively pouring gasoline on that fire,\" he told Newsweek. \"Again this is outside of the Fed's purview, I want to be very clear, but housing plays a major role in the sort of psyche of Americans about how they feel about their future.\"\n\nThe state of the housing market can shape how people feel about the country's financial status, he added.\n\n\"When people look around and see mortgage rates at 7 percent, that has the effect of stifling people's sort of aspirations, of really dampening people's confidence in the economy overall,\" Baydoun said.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "omar_mohammed@newsweek.com", "name": "Omar Mohammed", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real estate economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

The Federal Reserve also gave reassurance that it still sees a cut to interest rates, something Wall Street deeply desires, as likely this year.\n\nThe S&P 500 was 1% higher in afternoon trading and on track to add to its all-time high set a day earlier. The Nasdaq composite was also building on its own record and was up 1.7%, as of 2:15 pm. Eastern time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was lagging the market with a gain of 4 points, or less than 0.1%.\n\nThe action was even stronger in the bond market, where Treasury yields tumbled after the report showed U.S. consumers paid prices that were 3.3% higher for food, insurance and everything else last month, versus a year earlier. Economists had been expecting to see the inflation rate stuck at 3.4%.\n\nFor Wall Street, a slowdown in inflation not only helps U.S. households struggling to keep up with fast-rising prices, it also opens the door for the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate. Such a move would ease pressure on the economy and give a boost to investment prices.\n\nEverything from bitcoin to gold to copper rallied after the inflation data raised expectations for coming cuts to interest rates. A measure of nervousness among investors in U.S. stocks also eased.\n\nFor its part, the Federal Reserve kept its main interest rate steady after its latest meeting ended Wednesday afternoon. It said it still needs an accumulation of data showing inflation is sustainably heading toward its 2% target before it lowers the rate, which is at the highest level in more than two decades.\n\nBut the Fed also indicated most of its policymakers are still forecasting at least one cut to interest rates at some point this year. They also raised their forecast for the number of cuts in 2025.\n\nThe Fed trimmed its forecast for cuts to rates this year down from three after progress on bringing inflation lower seemed to stall early this year. But such a fall-off was widely expected, and traders are still largely betting on the first of potentially two cuts to rates this year coming in September, according to data from CME Group.\n\nThat had areas of the stock market that tend to benefit most from lower interest rates doing the best.\n\nSmaller companies that need to borrow to grow and feel the pinch of higher interest rates more than their larger rivals were leading the market. The smaller stocks in the Russell 2000 index jumped 2.4%.\n\nReal-estate stocks were also shooting higher. Lower interest rates mean bonds are paying less in interest, which can send potential investors to dividend-paying real-estate owners instead. Office owner Boston Properties jumped 4.3%.\n\nLower interest rates could also pull down mortgage rates and inject energy into the housing market. Homebuilder D.R. Horton climbed 3.1%.\n\nOracle helped lead Wall Street higher with a jump of 13.1% even though it reported weaker profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Financial analysts pointed to strong bookings, including contracts related to artificial-intelligence training.\n\nA furor around AI has helped send stocks to records despite worries about high interest rates and the slowdown in the economy that they induce. Nvidia again was one of the strongest forces pushing the S&P 500 higher, with a gain of 3.6%. The chip company has become the poster child of the AI rush, and its total market value has topped $3 trillion.\n\nThe only company to push more on the S&P 500 than Nvidia was Apple, which jumped 4.4%. Its stock has been jumping the last two days after getting a cool initial reception to the announcement of several AI-related offerings coming to its operating systems.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.27% from 4.40% late Monday and from 4.60% a couple weeks ago. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, slumped to 4.71% from 4.83% late Monday.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, European indexes jumped following the release of the encouraging U.S. inflation data. In Asia, where markets closed before the data came out, indexes were mixed. Japan's Nikkei 225 index lost 0.7% as investors wait for the Bank of Japan's latest announcement on interest rates due Friday.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.", "source": {"uri": "fox16.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KLRT - FOX16.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@fox16.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bond market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CME_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CME Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Properties", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Properties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikkei 225"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.fox16.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/84/2024/06/6669eabc1d3d92.54838201.jpeg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

It is anticipated that the headline inflation rate will be 3.4%, which is consistent with the annual increase in prices that occurred in April, as per our assessments at Knightsbridge.\n\nIt is probable that energy prices decreased in May on a seasonally adjusted basis as a result of a decrease in petroleum prices. This was likely a source of solace for consumers following the rise in gas prices in April and March. As petroleum prices continue to decrease, it is probable that gas prices will continue to decrease in the near future.\n\nIn May, prices are anticipated to have increased by 3.5% over the previous year on a \"core\" basis, which excludes the more volatile costs of food and gas. This represents a minor decrease from the 3.6% annual increase observed in April.\n\nIt is anticipated that core prices will have increased by 0.3% month over month in May, which is consistent with April.\n\nThe cost of shelter and core services, such as insurance and medical care, has resulted in a persistently elevated level of core inflation. Knightsbridge anticipates that these categories will make a tiny stride in the correct direction.\n\nThe economists anticipate that there will be \"more significant progress on services inflation\" in the future, as a result of the moderated rates of motor vehicle insurance, rent, and owners' equivalent rent. The hypothetical rent that a tenant would pay for the same property is known as the owners' equivalent rent.\n\nThe team at Goldman Sachs, led by Jan Hatzius, concurred that \"further disinflation\" is still in the pipeline this year, citing \"rebalancing in the auto, housing rental, and labor markets.\"\n\nIn addition, \"we expect offsets from catch-up inflation in healthcare and car insurance and from single-family rent growth continuing to outpace multifamily rent growth.\"\n\nIn December 2024, Goldman Sachs predicts that core CPI inflation will be 3.5% year over year and core PCE inflation will be 2.8%.\n\nTo cut or not to trim?\n\nThe Federal Reserve's annual inflation objective of 2% has been persistently exceeded. Additionally, the scheduling of the release of this CPI report may have contributed to the additional spectacle surrounding its release, despite the fact that it will not have an overly significant impact on the impending Fed decision.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has classified the path to 2% as \"bumpy,\" and other recent economic data has contributed to the Fed's narrative that interest rates will continue to rise for an extended period.\n\nThe labor market added 272,000 nonfarm payroll jobs last month, which is substantially more than the 180,000 additions predicted by economists, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday. The unemployment rate increased marginally from 3.9% to 4%, but wages also exceeded expectations at 4.1%.\n\nIt is important to note that the core PCE price index, which is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, has remained notably stubborn. April's core PCE change, which is closely monitored by the Federal Reserve, remained consistent at 2.8%, which is consistent with March.\n\nKnightsbridge anticipates that the Federal Reserve will implement a single reduction in December if the report aligns with our expectations. Knightsbridge believes that it is improbable that inflation data will weaken sufficiently in the upcoming months to allow the Fed to make a cut before December. The primary risk to the earlier cuts is a more rapid decline in employment growth than we anticipate or a more severe deceleration in shelter inflation.\n\nAccording to Knightsbridge, investors now anticipate a range of one to two 25-basis-point cuts in 2024, a decrease from the six cuts that were anticipated at the beginning of the year.\n\nMarkets were pricing in a roughly 48% likelihood that the Federal Reserve will begin to reduce rates at its September meeting as of Tuesday, according to data from the CME Group.", "source": {"uri": "livetradingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Live Trading News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knightsbridge", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Knightsbridge"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Knightsbridge"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Consumer Price Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disinflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motor vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payroll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Payroll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CME_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CME Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price index"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Car_Rentals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Car Rentals", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Predictions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Predictions", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.livetradingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/city_night_panorama_skyscraper_new_york_4k_5k_hd_travel-3840x2160-1-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

On a yearly basis, the PCE price index remained stable, rising 2.7% after increasing at the same pace in March. The PCE price index is one of the key inflation measures the US Fed tracks.\n\nAdditionally, the US Labor Department is set to release May's Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on Wednesday, which will be a crucial indicator for the Fed's decision.\n\nThe Fed will keep in mind that the Russia-Ukraine war and conflict in West Asia (Israel-Hamas war) persists.

The announcement will come just a few hours after the May CPI report came in cooler than expected.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nNo action by the U.S. central bank is seen as the most likely outcome. However, updated dot-plot projections for interest rates and fresh commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell may be a wild card.\n\nAs such, there will be a lot on the line when the Fed's Open Market Committee delivers its monetary policy decision and updated economic projections at 2:00 PM ET on Wednesday.\n\nThe next update is out already, with a fresh selection of 90+ AI-powered stock picks set to beat the market! Subscribe now and don't miss out on this chance to garnish hefty profits.\n\nThe Fed is all but certain to keep the benchmark Fed funds target range between 5.25% and 5.50%, where it has been since July 2023, as policymakers assess signs of a resilient economy, a robust labor market, and elevated inflation.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nFOMC officials will also release their new forecasts for interest rates and economic growth, known as the dot plot, which will reveal greater signs of the Fed's likely rate trajectory through the rest of 2024 and beyond.\n\nIn March, the dot plot indicated that policymakers anticipated three 25-basis point rate cuts by the end of the year. However, the economic landscape has shifted since then.\n\nAll eyes will then turn to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who will hold what will be a closely watched press conference at 2:30 PM ET as investors look for fresh clues on how he views the economy and inflation trends.\n\nWhen Powell last spoke in mid-May, he warned that inflation is falling more slowly than expected and that monetary policy needs to be restrictive for longer.\n\nWhile the Fed is all but certain to remain on hold, investors should brace themselves for a longer wait for rate cuts than previously anticipated despite the CPI report coming in cooler than expected. This is because the economy has held up better than anticipated, and the labor market remains strong.\n\nIn the post-meeting press conference, Chairman Powell is likely to underscore that Fed officials will need to see several more months of low inflation readings before they would consider cutting rates. Meanwhile, updated dot plot projections are expected to indicate a significant change to reflect the Fed's new stance on the latest data.\n\nGiven the proximity of the U.S. presidential election in November, it is increasingly likely that the Fed will avoid initiating a rate-cutting cycle starting in September. The central bank traditionally prefers not to make significant policy shifts close to elections to avoid any perception of political influence.\n\nConsidering the above factors, it appears the Fed might keep borrowing costs higher for longer than markets currently anticipate. This scenario aligns with the Fed's cautious approach to ensure inflation is firmly under control before easing monetary policy.\n\nAs such, December is emerging as the most probable timeline for the start of an easing cycle in my view. Investors should adjust their expectations accordingly, as the central bank navigates these complex economic and political landscapes.\n\nAny indications or shifts in the Fed's tone during the meeting could trigger significant market movements and investor sentiments. Taking that into consideration, market participants are advised to remain vigilant, exercise caution, and diversify portfolios to hedge against potential market fluctuations.\n\nTo navigate the

The moderation in inflation was aided by a slower rise in prices of food items such as meat, fish, milk products, vegetables, and spices. Inflation has stayed below below 5% since March.\n\nA Mint poll of 15 economists had estimated retail inflation to fall to 4.8% in May.\n\nFood inflation, which accounts for nearly 40% of the overall consumer price basket, rose 8.69% year-on-year in May, compared with an 8.70% rise in the previous month.\n\nFood prices have remained elevated for over a year now, primarily due to last year's uneven and below-normal monsoon rains. Food inflation has consistently stayed above 8% since November.\n\nCore inflation, which excludes the more volatile food, and fuel and light groups, makes up nearly 50% of the basket.\n\n\"Core inflation continued to remain benign and moderated further to 3.1% in May. However, high inflation in the food basket, especially in specific categories like vegetables and pulses, remains a concern,\" said Rajani Sinha, chief economist at CareEdge.\n\nRBI last raised the repo rate to 6.5% in February 2023, and has left it unchanged since then.\n\nRegulating interest rates is a key instrument for the central bank to control inflation. A higher interest rate regime makes borrowing costs more expensive, reducing demand among banks, financial institutions, and the general public, which can, in turn, bring down consumer spending and inflation.\n\n\"In terms of use-based classification the infra and primary goods segments witnessed steady growth due to the infra activity going on...Consumer durables demand may be attributed partly to rural spending as well as wedding season where people tend to buy more of these goods in April-May,\" said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Bank of Baroda.\n\nIn April, manufacturing output rose 3.9% annually, mining by 6.7%, and electricity by 10.2%.\n\nCapital goods production, a proxy for fixed investments, saw a 3.1% annual rise in April, while consumer durables production, reflecting consumer sentiment, surged by 9.8%.\n\nIndustrial output growth, which was at 4.61% in April 2023, had managed impressive gains of 10.9% in August and 11.9% in October, driven by strong mining output, festive demand for manufactured goods, and increased electricity generation. However, growth dipped to its lowest point of the year at 2.5% in November.\n\nSince then, India's industrial growth has shown signs of recovery.\n\nThe high growth in the fourth quarter meant the actual GDP growth recorded during FY24 beat the National Statistical Office forecast of 7.6% for the last fiscal.\n\nFor FY25, the RBI's economic growth estimate stands at 7.2%.\n\nMeanwhile, among states, Delhi and Uttarakhand reported the slowest retail inflation at 1.99% and 3.37%, respectively, during May, while Odisha (6.25%), and Karnataka (6.11%) recorded the fastest price rice.\n\nHowever, 12 of the 22 states witnessed higher than average inflation, indicating retail inflation is still considerably high in several large states like Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Karnataka, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rhik_kundu@livemint.com", "name": "Rhik

This might make it harder for foreign capital to enter Nigeria and cause the value of the naira to decline.\n\nBecause U.S. government bond yields are almost at an all-time high, foreign investors are playing it safe and are less interested in Nigeria's capital market. Normally, these investors would be less ready to take a chance on developing market bonds.\n\nThe dollar index, which measures how much the US dollar is worth in relation to a few other major currencies, fell by a little over 28 basis points overnight, closing below the 105 index point mark following its peak of 105.46 index points on May 14.\n\nUS inflation figures\n\nU.S. inflation data is of great interest to currency traders, and Wednesday is one of the most important days of the year for economic news due to the Federal Reserve's anticipated reaction.\n\nThe probability of sticky inflation and strong growth has helped the U.S. currency appreciate and decreased the chance that the central bank will drop interest rates soon, as indicated by Friday's better-than-expected jobs statistics.\n\nTwo fronts will be launched in this attack: the important consumer price index reading for May will be released this afternoon (Nigeria time), followed by the Fed's policy meeting, which will provide critical indicators about the state of the economy and if policymakers may soon take their foot off the brake.\n\nThe CPI figure, coupled with last Friday's surprisingly high nonfarm payrolls number and other recent data releases, is expected to cause economists to revise their forecasts for inflation and economic growth.\n\nAccording to market projections, the price index for a broad range of goods and services will grow by 0.1% from April to May, but will still climb by 3.4% annually overall. This indicates that the index will hardly vary from month to month in May\n\nPrices for food and energy are not included in the so-called core CPI, which is predicted to rise by 3.5% annually and 0.3% monthly.\n\nNone of those data significantly differs from the April readings, indicating that inflation is still much above the Federal Reserve's target rate of 2%.\n\nBut a deeper look at a few important metrics, such insurance costs and essential services that don't include housing, would show that inflation is, at the very least, rising steadily.\n\nProspects for the Fed Meeting\n\nThe consensus among market observers is that the Fed will shift the important \"dot plot\" upward. The grid is therefore anticipated to recommend fewer interest rate reductions than the three that were first predicted for 2024 in March.\n\nWhile most economists predict two drops, there is significant worry that the estimate could fall to only one.\n\nEconomists also anticipate that the Fed will cut its expectation for GDP growth and hike its anticipated inflation from March's estimates.\n\nTwo other notable Fed events include Chair Jerome Powell's news conference and the statement made following the meeting.", "source": {"uri": "thenews-chronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_naira", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian naira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Export\u2013Import_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "African Export\u2013Import Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Nigeria", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central Bank of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_reserves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange reserves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Probability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goods and services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Micromarketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Micromarketing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Associations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/thenews-chronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/clipboard-41.jpg?fit=940%2C529&ssl=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 1822, "textEnd": 1828}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

That suggests the Fed will cut rates by 0.25%. The Fed has moved in 25-basis-point increments over the last year or so, indicating the central bank expects to cut interest rates one time in 2024.\n\nAlong with its policy announcement, the Fed released updated economic forecasts in its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), including its \"dot plot,\" which maps out policymakers' expectations for where interest rates could be headed in the future.\n\nFifteen officials predict a rate cut this year while four see no cut. No officials project three cuts compared to the nine in March. No officials see rates ticking higher in 2024, consistent with March.\n\nThe updated projections suggest the Federal Reserve will maintain a \"higher for longer\" policy stance as the central bank works to bring inflation back down to its 2% target.\n\nImmediately following the announcement, markets were pricing in a roughly 71% chance the Federal Reserve will begin to cut rates at its September meeting, up from about 53% the day prior, according to data from the CME Group.\n\nThe central bank left interest rates unchanged in a range of 5.25%-5.5% at its meeting that concluded on Wednesday. Earlier in the day, a cooler-than-expected reading on inflation delivered welcome news for Fed policymakers, but it is unlikely to change the central bank's stance on rates.\n\nThe SEP indicated the Federal Reserve sees core inflation peaking at 2.8% this year -- higher than March's projection of 2.6% -- before cooling to 2.3% in 2025 and 2.0% in 2026.\n\nOfficials see the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.0% in 2024, matching the previous forecast.

With this rise, inflation came in between the target range of 1.0 and 3.0 percent.\n\nHowever, inflation is expected to increase as the effects of the domestic diesel price subsidy and the excess supply of certain raw food items are gradually phased out.\n\nThe bank expects headline inflation of 0.6 percent in 2024 and 1.3 percent in 2025. Meanwhile, core inflation is forecast at 0.5 and 0.9 percent for 2024 and 2025, respectively.\n\nOverall, headline inflation is anticipated to gradually return to the target range by the fourth quarter of 2024 onwards, with medium-term inflation expectations remaining consistent with the target, the bank said.\n\nThe Thai economy continued to expand by 1.5 percent in the first quarter compared to last year, driven by household consumption and growth in tourist arrivals. Looking ahead, the economy is projected to expand by 2.6 and 3.0 percent in 2024 and 2025, respectively.\n\nThe bank reiterated that the policy rate remains consistent with improving growth and inflation outlook while fostering macro-financial stability in the longer term.\n\n\"However, it remains essential to monitor economic developments, especially the recovery of exports and government measures,\" the bank said in a statement.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com", "source": {"uri": "rttnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTTNews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Thailand", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Thailand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diesel fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excess_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Excess supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Thailand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of Thailand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumption_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumption (economics)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://cdn.rttnews.com/articleimages/forextopstory/2024/june/thailand-nove20_12jun24-lt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

U.S. consumer prices stopped rising last month. The CPI number was unchanged between April and May. Inflation is over! If only.\n\nNow, the bond market did react like this was a big development, and understandably so. It wasn't just that the headline was flat. The core was also up just two-tenths of a point, which was less than expected. The year-on-year rates are still over 3% for both, but if we continue to get monthly readings like these, inflation will be back towards \"normal\" quickly. Markets are now pricing in two rate cuts by year-end.\n\nBut as we know, consumers aren't feeling much relief yet. Confidence and sentiment readings have been lower than \"usual\" when the job market is this strong. The obvious reason seems to be the cumulative toll inflation has taken over the past four years since the pandemic hit. No one feels good paying $9.19 for a McDonald's 10-count chicken nugget meal, even if they're earning a bit more than they used to.\n\nOn top of that, the biggest inflation lately has come from unavoidable expenses like health care and insurance--\"needs\" areas, as Piper Sandler calls them. Sure enough, as of April, Piper's \"non-discretionary\" CPI basket was up 6.2% year-on-year. Ouch! Meanwhile, their discretionary basket was up just 0.3%.\n\nIn other words, \"needs\" inflation is \"acting like a tax, crowding out discretionary spending, and pulling down inflation elsewhere,\" says Piper economist Jake Oubina. And you can see this crowding-out pattern playing out in corporate earnings. As Pepsi put it, \"The lower income consumer in the U.S. is stretched...choosing what to buy, where to buy.\" Tyson Foods also noted \"a more cautious, price-sensitive consumer.\"\n\nThe trouble is that \"needs\" inflation may stay elevated for awhile. Health care--we know the myriad issues with that. Insurance rates are also expected to keep rising. Shelter inflation is still running hot, up 0.4 points again last month, and the high cost of renting single-family homes is expected to keep upward pressure there for some time.\n\nUnfortunately, as Oubina points out, the Fed is looking at these same areas (which it calls \"super-core\" inflation) to cool down before dramatically lowering rates. In other words, the Fed could be running policy too tight, trying to cool down inflation in \"needs\" areas that are either idiosyncratic or still seeing lagged upward pressure from the pandemic.\n\nAs a result, parts of the economy may slip into deflation long before inflation is tamped out in those sticky areas. Sure enough, prices online have been falling for almost two years now, according to Adobe's Digital Price Index. In May, the index was down 5% from a year earlier, with apparel prices down 11%, electronics down nearly 8%, and appliances and furniture down 5% each.\n\nAnd the longer this \"needs\" versus \"wants\" inflation persists, the bigger the gaps we're going to see between the haves and have-nots in both consumer and corporate America.", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kelly_evans@cnbc.com", "name": "Kelly Evans", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bond market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pepsi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyson_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyson Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelter_(building)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shelter (building)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furniture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Furniture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clothing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Family_and_Consumer_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Family and Consumer Science", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107171503-1674531260536-kelly.jpg?v=1698072620&w=1920&h=1080", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

The Federal Reserve also gave reassurance that it still sees a cut to interest rates, something Wall Street deeply desires, as likely this year.\n\nThe S&P 500 was 1% higher in afternoon trading and on track to add to its all-time high set a day earlier. The Nasdaq composite was also building on its own record and was up 1.7%, as of 2:15 pm. Eastern time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was lagging the market with a gain of 4 points, or less than 0.1%.\n\nThe action was even stronger in the bond market, where Treasury yields tumbled after the report showed U.S. consumers paid prices that were 3.3% higher for food, insurance and everything else last month, versus a year earlier. Economists had been expecting to see the inflation rate stuck at 3.4%.\n\nFor Wall Street, a slowdown in inflation not only helps U.S. households struggling to keep up with fast-rising prices, it also opens the door for the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate. Such a move would ease pressure on the economy and give a boost to investment prices.\n\nEverything from bitcoin to gold to copper rallied after the inflation data raised expectations for coming cuts to interest rates. A measure of nervousness among investors in U.S. stocks also eased.\n\nFor its part, the Federal Reserve kept its main interest rate steady after its latest meeting ended Wednesday afternoon. It said it still needs an accumulation of data showing inflation is sustainably heading toward its 2% target before it lowers the rate, which is at the highest level in more than two decades.\n\nBut the Fed also indicated most of its policymakers are still forecasting at least one cut to interest rates at some point this year. They also raised their forecast for the number of cuts in 2025.\n\nThe Fed trimmed its forecast for cuts to rates this year down from three after progress on bringing inflation lower seemed to stall early this year. But such a fall-off was widely expected, and traders are still largely betting on the first of potentially two cuts to rates this year coming in September, according to data from CME Group.\n\nThat had areas of the stock market that tend to benefit most from lower interest rates doing the best.\n\nSmaller companies that need to borrow to grow and feel the pinch of higher interest rates more than their larger rivals were leading the market. The smaller stocks in the Russell 2000 index jumped 2.4%.\n\nReal-estate stocks were also shooting higher. Lower interest rates mean bonds are paying less in interest, which can send potential investors to dividend-paying real-estate owners instead. Office owner Boston Properties jumped 4.3%.\n\nLower interest rates could also pull down mortgage rates and inject energy into the housing market. Homebuilder D.R. Horton climbed 3.1%.\n\nOracle helped lead Wall Street higher with a jump of 13.1% even though it reported weaker profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Financial analysts pointed to strong bookings, including contracts related to artificial-intelligence training.\n\nA furor around AI has helped send stocks to records despite worries about high interest rates and the slowdown in the economy that they induce. Nvidia again was one of the strongest forces pushing the S&P 500 higher, with a gain of 3.6%. The chip company has become the poster child of the AI rush, and its total market value has topped $3 trillion.\n\nThe only company to push more on the S&P 500 than Nvidia was Apple, which jumped 4.4%. Its stock has been jumping the last two days after getting a cool initial reception to the announcement of several AI-related offerings coming to its operating systems.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.27% from 4.40% late Monday and from 4.60% a couple weeks ago. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, slumped to 4.71% from 4.83% late Monday.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, European indexes jumped following the release of the encouraging U.S. inflation data. In Asia, where markets closed before the data came out, indexes were mixed. Japan's Nikkei 225 index lost 0.7% as investors wait for the Bank of Japan's latest announcement on interest rates due Friday.\n\nAP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach

Sign up to watch, and learn, with us.\n\nWhat causes inflation? Economists have some ideas -- namely, when demand broadly outstrips supply and prices rise. It turns out, the general public doesn't always see eye-to-eye with economists on why inflation happens or on how to fight it, according to the results of a survey published recently by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nMost people surveyed said government spending causes inflation. That can be a factor, depending on the program.\n\nBut when asked what kind of government spending they're concerned about, \"people think that foreign aid from the United States is the number one source of inflation. It's a joke,\" said Yuriy Gorodnichenko, an economist at UC Berkeley.\n\nThere's no evidence that foreign aid has caused higher prices in the U.S., he said. But Gorodnichenko is not surprised about discrepancies like this. Because \"economists are not people, and people are not economists.\"\n\nOr at least, people don't always think like economists -- who measure inflation using tools like the consumer price index, per Stefanie Stantcheva, an economist at Harvard who led the survey.\n\n\"The CPI, you know, the way we measure inflation is really highly imperfect,\" she said. \"It doesn't capture the fact that different people consume different baskets of goods. And so people have a very valid lived experience that just sometimes doesn't align with our official statistics.\"\n\nMost respondents also said raising interest rates will increase inflation. That -- to be clear -- is the exact opposite of economic orthodoxy, which says if you make it more expensive to borrow money, consumer demand drops, and -- in theory -- that should help bring prices down. So, why do so many people think rate hikes lead to higher prices?\n\n\"When we live in environments of high inflation, we tend to see interest rates go up. And so the causality might not be clear, right?\" Stantcheva said. \"We see a correlation that's there, and it might be difficult to trace the causality.\"\n\nOne solution, argues Francesco D'Acunto, a finance professor at Georgetown, who studies how people understand inflation: \"Fine tune the communication of policymakers in a way that actually makes very clear what the objective of the policy is.\"\n\nIn other words, better explanations from, say, the Federal Reserve about why it's changing interest rates to keep inflation in check.", "source": {"uri": "marketplace.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Marketplace"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_ackerman@marketplace.org", "name": "Daniel Ackerman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bureau_of_Economic_Research", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Bureau of Economic Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefanie_Stantcheva", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stefanie Stantcheva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Berkeley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Correlation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgetown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.marketplace.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1801101064-e1717169461306.jpg?fit=2880%2C1622&w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

This could hinder foreign investment inflows into Nigeria and depreciate the naira's value.\n\nThe yields on U.S. government bonds are near an all-time high, causing global investors, who would normally be less willing to take a chance on developing market bonds, to play it safe and show less interest in Nigeria's capital market.\n\nThe dollar index, which compares the value of the US dollar to a few other major currencies, was down a little more than 28 basis points, trading below the 105 index point threshold overnight after hitting its highest level since May 14 at 105.46 index points.\n\nCurrency traders are keen on U.S. inflation readings, and the Federal Reserve's intended response on Wednesday is one of the most significant days of the year for economic news.\n\nAs suggested by Friday's better-than-expected jobs data, the possibility of sticky inflation and robust growth has helped the U.S. dollar strengthen and lessened the likelihood that the central bank will lower interest rates soon.\n\nCrucial indications regarding the economy and whether policymakers may soon take their foot off the brake will be issued in a two-pronged attack that begins this afternoon (Nigeria time) with the crucial consumer price index reading for May and concludes with the Fed's policy meeting.\n\nEconomists anticipate that the CPI report, together with the unexpectedly high nonfarm payrolls number from last Friday and other recent data releases, will prompt Fed members to adjust their projections for inflation and economic growth.\n\nMarkets project that the price index for a wide range of products and services will barely change from month to month in May, rising by 0.1% from April to May but still representing a 3.4% annual increase overall.\n\nThe so-called core CPI, which does not include food and energy prices, is expected to increase at 3.5% annually and 0.3% monthly.\n\nAll those figures indicate that inflation is still substantially above the Federal Reserve's goal rate of 2%, and none deviates much from the readings from April.\n\nHowever, a closer examination of several key indicators, such as insurance premiums and core services that do not include housing, would demonstrate that inflation is, at the very least, gradually increasing.\n\nThe market commentary broadly agrees that the Fed will move the crucial \"dot plot\" in an upward direction. As a result, the grid is expected to suggest fewer interest rate reductions than the three projected for 2024 in March.\n\nMost economists anticipate two reductions, but there is considerable concern that the prognosis may drop to just one.\n\nAdditionally, economists expect the Fed to raise its projected inflation from March's predictions and lower its outlook for growth in the gross domestic product.\n\nThe post-meeting statement and Chair Jerome Powell's news conference are two more noteworthy Fed events.", "source": {"uri": "nairametrics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nairametrics"}, "authors": [{"uri": "olumide_adesina@nairametrics.com", "name": "Olumide Adesina", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Nigeria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bank of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_naira", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian naira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Export\u2013Import_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "African Export\u2013Import Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_reserves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange reserves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Note", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Note"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depreciation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Treasury security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign direct investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price index"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Associations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://nairametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Naira-and-Dollar-1-1024x599.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 1730, "textEnd": 1736}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Most other measures suggest that the economy is healthy: Unemployment remains low, hiring is robust and consumers are traveling, eating out and spending on entertainment. Yet polls show that the cumulative price increases are weighing on Biden's popularity.\n\nThe Fed is closely monitoring each month's inflation report for signs that it's succeeding in its fight against rising prices. A rise in core consumer prices of 0.3% is too high, over time, to be consistent with the central bank's 2% annual inflation target and could be seen as a disappointment. Still, the Fed's officials prefer a separate inflation measure, which typically comes in slightly lower than Wednesday's consumer price index.\n\nAfter their latest two-day policy meeting ends Wednesday -- just hours after the release of the May inflation data -- the officials are poised to leave their benchmark interest rate unchanged at a 23-year high of about 5.3%.", "source": {"uri": "financialpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Family_and_Consumer_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Family and Consumer Science", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Prices rose 3.3% over the year, slightly lower than the year-over-year rate as April. Both numbers were better than the consensus expectation from economists surveyed by the Dow Jones Newswires and the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThis report could help ease fears that inflation is flaring up again after price increases were surprisingly elevated in the first quarter. However, today's report indicates prices have continued their descent, falling significantly from the 41-year peak hit in June 2022, when the CPI was up 9.1% over the previous 12 months.\n\nFederal Reserve's officials meet later today and have said they're looking for economic data -- especially inflation reports -- to show that consumer prices are firmly on the path down to a 2% annually before they'll cut interest rates. The central bank has maintained its key fed funds rate at a 23-year high since last July, pushing up borrowing costs for mortgages and other loans, in hopes of slowing the economy and stifling inflation.\n\nBefore the report, traders were pricing in July 8.9% chance of a rate cut in July and 54.4% in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, which forecasts rate movements based on fed funds futures trading data.

Key developments include the final German CPI and UK's monthly GDP figures. Traders are keenly watching for any signals on interest rates and economic projections, particularly in light of ongoing inflation concerns.\n\nA look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Tom Westbrook Markets are likely to stay tentative through Europe's morning hours ahead of a blockbuster session in the U.S., where inflation data is due out in the morning before the Federal Reserve meets to set rates and publish its economic projections.\n\nIt's likely to overshadow final German CPI numbers and Britain's monthly GDP figures due in the London day. Economists expect U.S. headline inflation steadied at an annual 3.4% in May. If it's much hotter than that it will not be well received by equity markets perched at record highs, particularly if it seems to reverse the cheered cooling notched in April.\n\nMarkets expect the Fed to leave interest rates on hold and so the focus will be on the economic projections and how Chairman Jerome Powell explains them at his press conference. On rates, the Fed's median projection at the March meeting was for three cuts this year. That is likely to change in response to sticky inflation and a strong economy.\n\nMarkets currently price about 40 basis points of rate cuts in 2024. So if the median projection were to fall to just one 25 bp cut it would be a blow, while zero would be super hawkish. A lot may depend on how Powell frames it: Do fewer cuts this year mean more next year, or not? In March, Fed policymakers saw longer-run interest rates between 2.4% and 3.8%, as they had in December. But the median projection ticked up from 2.5% to 2.6%.\n\nIn March just one policymaker expected long-run rates below 2.5%, down from five a year earlier. If those projections start creeping up it could derail the bond rally that was already jolted by last week's surprisingly strong jobs report. In the Asia day, China's consumer price index fell 0.1% in May from a month earlier, disappointing forecasts, as price wars exacerbate deflationary pressure in the world's second-biggest economy.\n\nJapan's wholesale inflation jumped in May at the fastest annual pace in nine months, as the weak yen added upward pressure on prices. The data complicates the Bank of Japan's decision, on Friday, on how soon to raise interest rates.

Rowe Price.\n\n\"We're probably not going to get to 2% on inflation until late 2025 or even early 2026,\" she said. \"We haven't seen the degree of destruction in domestic demand that would bring inflation pressures down.\"\n\nUru\u00e7i said \"a Goldilocks outcome\" for the U.S. economy, in which inflation comes down slowly and the economy remains resilient, would favour asset classes such as mortgages, where investors can benefit from both increases in value as well as positive returns from interest rates.\n\nWhile it is tempting to build investment plans on hopes for the economy or the consensus view, she said that is a dangerous strategy.\n\n\"Oftentimes, the dominant consensus view is not the one that plays out, so we're not keen to put all our eggs in one basket,\" she said. \"We try hard to think about why perhaps this time inflation pressures may not come down in as benign a way.\"\n\nIf stubborn inflation prevents the Federal Reserve from cutting rates in the near term, she said, alternative strategies would become more attractive.\n\n\"We wouldn't want to prematurely add duration,\" she said. \"We'd want to stay more on the front end of the curve, as well as explore opportunities in credit, and short-dated credit in particular.\"\n\nUru\u00e7i advocates building portfolios with hedging properties in case inflation remains higher for longer. \"Short-dated credit assets would perform well in this world,\" she said.\n\nShe also likes inflation-linked bonds.\n\n\"I think this would be a good opportunity to start buying the dip and adding duration to portfolios,\" she said.\n\nUru\u00e7i said the U.S. has been experiencing demand-pull inflation rather than cost-push inflation.\n\n\"Typically cost-push inflation is where you start getting worried about wage-price spirals,\" she said. \"I think we very much experienced demand-pull inflation, where demand is strong and firms are able to pass on price cost increases as well as maintain a healthy profit margin.\"\n\nFurther, \"as vacancies have come down and the labour market churn has slowed, we are also seeing wage inflation come down. And this is happening even as the unemployment rate hasn't increased,\" she pointed out. \"Historically, you needed a spike in the unemployment rate to bring down wage inflation.

As the prospect of higher-for-longer continues to sink in, small businesses are beginning to feel the pinch, per a Bloomberg feature published on Tuesday.\n\nThe US Bureau of Labor Statistics will also be publishing its latest inflation report for the month of May on Wednesday, mere hours before The Fed's policy meeting. Barring shocking results, economists aren't expecting a major Fed pivot. In a Financial Times-Chicago Booth poll of 39 academics published Monday, more than half said they expect a single quarter-point rate cut this year, while almost a quarter of respondents expect no cut at all.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems not every business owner in America consulted their local monetary policy expert before making plans for the year (though, in this instance, a trip to the local psychic may have been even more useful). And the costs of expensive cash are now starting to add up. According to National Federation of Independent Business data, the share of small firms that cite financing costs as their top business problem has hit a 14-year high. Meanwhile, the default rate on small business loans hit 3.2% in April, according to Equifax, the highest rate in a decade.\n\nThe upshot is that higher-for-longer is eating away at small businesses' plans for reinvestment:\n\nInflation Nation: While inflation in the US has cooled significantly since its peak, consumers aren't so sure. Why? Because interest rates remain high. While textbook economic theory long held that high interest rates temper spending, thus decreasing inflation (and given that inflation has cooled as interest rates have gone up, the correlation once again appears provably true). But, in an argument recently outlined by Paul Krugman in The New York Times, consumers see those very same rates as more inflation. After all, the argument goes, aren't high interest rates simply just inflating the price of money itself? In other words, while economists see high interest rates as easing inflation in the long term, consumers simply see them as yet more inflation in the present. The good news for the inflation-weary?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 134 points, or 0.3%, as of 11:20 a.m. Eastern Time, and the Nasdaq Composite Index was up 1.9%.\n\nAction was even stronger in the bond market, where Treasury yields fell after the report showed U.S. consumers paid 3.3% higher prices for food, insurance and everything remains last month, compared to a year earlier. Economists had expected an inflation rate stuck at 3.4%.\n\nFor Wall Street, a slowdown in inflation does not only help American households I'm having trouble following with prices rising rapidly, this also opens the door to the Federal Reserve lower its main interest rate. Such a move would ease pressure on the economy and boost investment prices.\n\nEverything from bitcoin to gold to copper rallied after inflation data raised expectations of upcoming interest rate cuts. Investor nervousness about U.S. stocks has also eased.\n\nVirtually no one expects the Federal Reserve to begin cutting interest rates at its latest meeting, which is scheduled to end Wednesday afternoon. The Fed has insisted that it needs an accumulation of data showing that inflation is moving sustainably toward its 2% target.\n\nThat's good news, but we'll need more, according to Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\n\nBut it's good news after progress in reducing inflation appeared to stall earlier this year. Some recent better-than-expected labor market reports have also raised concerns about continued upward pressure on inflation. Of course, a slowdown in inflation too quickly could also raise fears that U.S. consumer spending will fall too sharply, which could lead to a recession.\n\nTraders bet the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates as early as September, according to CME Group data.\n\nThis has allowed sectors of the stock market that tend to benefit the most from falling interest rates to fare best amid a broad-based recovery.\n\nSmall businesses that need to borrow to grow and feel the effects of rising interest rates more than their rivals led the market. The smallest stocks in the Russell 2000 index jumped 2.8%.\n\nReal estate values have also climbed. Lower interest rates mean bonds pay less interest, which can lead potential investors to look at dividend-paying property owners. Office owner Boston Properties jumped 5.5%.\n\nLower interest rates could also lead to a decline mortgage rates and inject energy into the real estate market. Homebuilder DR Horton climbed 4.8%.\n\nOracle helped push Wall Street up with a 10.7% jump, even though it reported a profit for the latest quarter that was weaker than analysts expected. Financial analysts pointed to strong bookings, including contracts related to artificial intelligence training.\n\nThe furore around AI has helped propel stocks to record highs despite concerns about high interest rates and the economic slowdown they bring. Nvidia was once again one of the most powerful forces pushing the S&P 500 higher, with a 3.9% gain. The microchip company has become the poster child of the AI rush, and its total market value has surpassed $3 trillion.\n\nThe only company that pushed more on the S&P 500 than Nvidia was Apple, which jumped 5%. Its stock has jumped in the last two days after receiving an initial favorable reception to the announcement of several AI-related offerings coming to its operating systems.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on 10-year Treasury bills fell to 4.26%, compared to 4.40% Monday evening and 4.60% a few weeks ago. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, fell to 4.68% from 4.83% late Monday.\n\nOn foreign stock markets, European indices jumped following the publication of encouraging data on American inflation. In Asia, where markets closed before the data was released, indices were mixed. Japan's Nikkei 225 index lost 0.7% as investors await the Bank of Japan's latest interest rate announcement scheduled for Friday.\n\n___\n\nAP Business writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach

While there is a tendency to look at the headline inflation number and whether it is going up or down, this can miss the scale of change over time and how increased costs affect different groups of people.\n\nTo get a better sense of the impacts of inflation, we spoke to Chris Sibley and Edel Flannery from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) to see what the statistics tell us.\n\nFirst of all, what is inflation?\n\nChris Sibley - \"Inflation is generally described as a decrease in the purchasing power of money so in effect it means you spend more to get the same goods or services. Think of any product you buy regularly, be it a litre of milk or a sliced pan, and if the price increases it takes up more of your money to buy that one item, so inflation has a direct impact on your ability to spend money on other items.\"\n\nWe need your consent to load this rte-player contentWe use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity.

In recent years we've seen very significant increases with inflation of 7.8% in 2022 and of 6.3% in 2023. As of April this year, inflation is running at approximately 2.6% on an annual basis, so while inflation has fallen from its heights in previous years, prices are still rising by 2.6%.\n\nWhat notable changes have we seen in inflation in recent years?\n\nWhile we often look at the percentage year-on-year increase, that can overlook the cumulative effect of inflation over time and anyone who has paid an electricity bill or bought a weekly shop will know that prices are much higher than they were just a few years ago.\n\nOne of the items we track is the price of a white sliced pan. In January 2019 the average price was \u20ac1.28, but it was \u20ac1.64 in April 2024, up 28.1%. During the same period, the average national price for a litre of low fat milk went form \u20ac1.04 to \u20ac1.25, an increase of 20.2%. When it comes to prices for electricity, gas and other fuels, these increased by 64.6% in the same period. From this we can see that inflation is experienced across small and large purchases, but it all adds up.\n\nWe need your consent to load this rte-player contentWe use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity.

We've worked to give a better insight into the impact of inflation by combining headline inflation figures with results from our Household Budget Survey.\n\n\"For example, the official measure of inflation showed that prices for consumer goods and services rose by 6.4% from September 2022 to September 2023. But for households where the dwelling is owned with a mortgage, this group experienced inflation of 7.8% compared with a rate of 5.6% for households that own their home outright, reflecting the impact of increased mortgage interest payments.\n\n\"The household composition types with the highest estimated inflation rate (6.8%) were households with one adult without children, households containing two adults with more than three children, or households containing three or more adults with children. There was also a slight difference based on where you live, with the annual inflation rate for urban households being 6.5%, while estimated inflation stood at 6.3% for rural households.\"\n\nWe need your consent to load this rte-player contentWe use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity.

Over this period, overall inflation as measured by the CPI was 19.1%, but the estimated inflation experienced by households for persons aged 65 or over was higher at 19.5%. Households where the household reference person was aged under 35 had lower estimated inflation at 18.8% versus an average of 19.1%.\n\nDo we have any insight into inflation across levels of income?\n\nFor the lowest 10% of households by income, the largest contributors to their experience of inflation were increases in electricity, gas, other fuels and rent. By contrast, for the top 10% of households by income, the increase in mortgage interest payments was the largest contributor to their experience of inflation.\n\nHow have earnings tracked inflation?\n\nWhen it comes to household income, this can be affected by taxation and social welfare payments. Looking at wage levels in the period from 2019-2024 from our Earnings and Labour Costs statistical publication, we see that average hourly earnings rose by 24% in the five years to Q1 2024. All sectors saw increases in average hourly earnings over this period, but the largest increase of 38.6% was experienced in Information & Communication. In contrast, average hourly earnings in Transportation rose by 5.6% in the period.\n\nThe CSO publishes a wealth of data on inflation, income and earnings and more information can be found online or on various social channels.\n\nFollow RT\u00c9 Brainstorm on WhatsApp and Instagram for more stories and updates\n\nThe views expressed here are those of the author and do not represent or reflect the views of RT\u00c9", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTE.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Statistics_Office_(Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Statistics Office (Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_good", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Final good"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT\u00c9_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RT\u00c9 News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT\u00c9", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RT\u00c9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT\u00c9_Radio", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RT\u00c9 Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Purchasing power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goods and services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bread"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morning Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Household"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Estimating", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Estimating", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img.rasset.ie/00157eff-1600.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-01-", "textStart": 2508, "textEnd": 2520}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-09-", "textStart": 5053, "textEnd": 5067}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

All three benchmark indexes ticked higher, with the Dow surging by over 200 points and the S&P 500 Nasdaq notched fresh record highs.\n\nInflation came in softer than expected, with consumer prices remaining flat over the month of May. On a yearly basis, inflation was up 3.3%.

A single cut, likely at the Federal Reserve's final FOMC meeting of the year, would mean interest rates would remain at their 23-year high until after Joe Biden and Donald Trump face off at the ballot box.\n\nThe Fed has long expressed far more caution in its predictions than investors.

The median core PCE projection was increased from 2.6% in March's SEP to 2.8% now. Most dramatic is the difference between March's expectation of a median federal funds rate of 4.6% for the year to 5.1% in June. Whereas the March SEP had just two Fed members anticipating no rate cuts at all in 2024, four agreed in June's SEP.\n\nThe Fed now expects the median federal funds rate to remain above 4% in 2025 and 3% in 2026.

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell said during the Wednesday press conference that when looking at the FOMC's projections, they should be viewed as just that: projections. There's still time for them to change based on upcoming economic data, he said, and it's \"plausible\" that a rate cut could happen as soon as September.\n\n\"We want to gain further confidence. Certainly, more good inflation readings will help with that,\" Powell said.\n\n\"It's going to be the totality of the data, what's happening in the labor market, what's happening with the balance of risks, what's happening with the forecast, what's happening with growth,\" he added. \"You look at all of that, and you ask, 'Are we confident? Have we reached an appropriate level of confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably to 2%, or alternatively, do we see really unexpected signs of weakness in the labor market?'\"\n\nThe Consumer Price Index, which measures inflation, rose 3.3% year over year in May, a slight decrease from April's 3.4% reading, showing the economy is headed in the right direction. While Powell said the latest reading is a positive sign, it's not sufficient to allow the Fed to loosen its restrictive monetary policy.\n\nHowever, some Democratic lawmakers have urged Powell to cut rates sooner rather than later, given the financial strains Americans continue to face under high inflation. Powell acknowledged those pains but reiterated that it's most important for the Fed to hold off on cutting until it gets more data rather than cutting too soon and having to raise rates again at a later date.\n\n\"In the meantime, it's going to be painful for people, but the ultimate pain would be a long period of high inflation,\" Powell said. \"It is people who have lower incomes, people at the margins of the economy who have the worst experience, who experience the most pain from inflation. So you know, it's for those people, for all Americans, but particularly for those people, that we're doing everything we can to bring inflation back down under control.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ayelet_sheffey@businessinsider.com", "name": "Ayelet Sheffey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/History", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Orthopedic", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Orthopedic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/6669f60be079049018186625?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

The NSE Nifty 50 index climbed 0.5% to 23,384.20 by mid-morning India time, while the S&P BSE Sensex rose 0.5% to 76,861.94.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nThe Indian market's positive start was significantly buoyed by IT stocks, a sector sensitive to US interest rates and a major revenue driver in the US. These stocks saw a healthy 1.25% rise. Expectations around budget allocations under the newly elected government and their distributed cabinet portfolios also played a role in this uptick, as noted by the head of research at Profitmart Securities. Domestically focused small-cap and mid-cap stocks recorded gains close to 0.9% each, with 12 out of the 13 major sectors in the green. Consumer stocks, however, slipped by 0.37% due to inflation concerns.\n\nInvestors are keeping a close eye on the Federal Reserve's updated projections and comments. While US consumer price inflation could ease, a strong jobs report suggests ongoing inflation and economic growth. This has reduced the likelihood of a Fed rate cut in September to 56%, down from 78% a week ago. In India, inflation expectations have climbed to 4.89%, ending a four-month downtrend and indicating potential delays in interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India. Rate-sensitive financials rose by 0.4% amid this context.\n\nThe bigger picture: The dual dance of inflation and growth.\n\nGlobally, financial markets are navigating between the prospects of inflation easing and persistent growth. In the US, reduced expectations of a near-term rate cut underline investor caution about inflationary pressures. In India, while the rise in IT stock suggests optimism, the uptick in inflation highlights underlying economic concerns.

Source: Lumen roma, shared under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license. / Lumen roma\n\nThis week, the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) will decide whether to follow the European Central Bank (ECB) in reducing interest rates, a move that is widely anticipated by analysts.\n\nThe executive board of the NBS will convene on June 13 to determine the course of interest rates. Most analysts predict that Serbia's monetary institution will mirror the ECB's recent decision and cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points.\n\nSerbia has been waiting for the major central banks to make a move before making any decisions. In May, the NBS executive board chose to maintain borrowing costs, keeping the reference interest rate steady at 6.5%, with deposit rates at 5.25% and credit facility rates at 7.75%.\n\nThis week will also bring critical inflation data for May, set to be released by the Statistical Office (RZS) on June 12. The NBS has projected that inflation will fall within the target range this month. Earlier forecasts anticipated that inflation would return to around 4.5% by mid-year.\n\nIn April, year-on-year inflation remained stable at 5%, unchanged from March. The drivers of inflation shifted, with gas and services replacing food as the primary contributors.\n\nTotal inflation in April was significantly lower than its peak in March last year, when it was more than three times higher. This decline was due to slower food price growth, which, due to easing global cost pressures, fell below the overall inflation level and registered a year-on-year increase of 2.9% in April.\n\n\"Last week, the ECB cut interest rates by 25 basis points, paving the way for the Serbian central bank to begin monetary easing. Serbia made it clear that it was waiting for the major central banks to make a move before making any decisions,\" said a note from Erste emailed to bne IntelliNews.\n\n\"One day prior to the central bank meeting in Serbia, the headline inflation for May will be released. If it falls within the tolerance band around the inflation target, we may see an interest rate cut as a highly probable scenario at the upcoming meeting.\"\n\nNBS governor Jorgovanka Tabakovic noted that core inflation, a critical measure excluding volatile items such as food and energy, had decreased by 6.5 percentage points to 4.8% in April.

Food costs also increased, up 0.6% on last month, and 0.5% in April.\n\nHowever, the prices of goods saw a slowdown, inching up 1% in May, compared with 1.2% in the previous month, with energy prices continuing to fall further, at -1.1%, down from -1.2%.\n\nThis was in spite of some German energy price subsidies and caps being recently wound up, as well as the country launching an increased carbon price at the beginning of the year. Germany also ended the temporary VAT discount for district heating and gas in April this year.\n\nYear-on-year core inflation, which does not take into account energy and food prices due to their inherent volatility, came in at 3% in May. Month-on-month inflation was 0.1% for May, a five-month low and in line with market forecasts. April's figure, in contrast, was 0.5%.\n\nRuth Brand, President of the Federal Statistical Office said, in a press release: \"The inflation rate is slightly up again, mainly due to the continued increase in service prices. By contrast, energy and food prices have had a dampening effect on overall inflation since the beginning of the year.\"\n\nThe German economy has been struggling, due to higher inflation, higher interest rates and economic uncertainty, which has led to dampened consumer sentiment.\n\nHowever, as inflation began to fall, consumers and businesses alike had started seeing signs of optimism pointing towards Germany's recovery. Although in line with analysts' forecasts, May's figure may lead to increased worries about the economy backtracking.\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) recently cut its interest rates from a record high of 4% to 3.75% at its June meeting. With Germany, the second largest economy in Europe, still seeing a rise in inflation, the ECB's move could cause concern about further cuts in interest rates.\n\nThe ECB has so far held back about its future plans.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 57 points, or 0.2%, as of 1:11 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.8% higher.\n\nThe action was even stronger in the bond market, where Treasury yields tumbled after the report showed U.S. consumers paid prices that were 3.3% higher for food, insurance and everything else last month, versus a year earlier. Economists had been expecting to see the inflation rate stuck at 3.4%.\n\nFor Wall Street, a slowdown in inflation not only helps U.S. households struggling to keep up with fast-rising prices, it also opens the door for the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate. Such a move would ease pressure on the economy and give a boost to investment prices.\n\nEverything from bitcoin to gold to copper rallied after the inflation data raised expectations for coming cuts to interest rates. A measure of nervousness among investors in U.S. stocks also eased.\n\nVirtually no one expects the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates at its latest meeting, which is scheduled to end Wednesday afternoon. The Fed has been adamant that it needs an accumulation of data showing inflation is sustainably heading toward its 2% target.\n\nRelated Story: Stock Market Today: AI Stocks Leap as Interest-Rate Worries Hold Back the Rest ...\n\n\"This is good news, but we will need more of it,\" according to Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing within Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\n\nBut it's welcome news after progress on bringing inflation down seemed to stall early this year. Some stronger-than-expected reports recently on the job market also raised worries about upward pressure remaining on inflation. Of course, too quick a slowdown in inflation could also raise worries that spending by U.S. consumers is falling off too sharply, which could lead to a recession.\n\nBets among traders built for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates as soon as September, according to data from CME Group.\n\nThat had areas of the stock market that tend to benefit most from lower interest rates doing the best amid a widespread rally.\n\nSmaller companies that need to borrow to grow and feel the pinch of higher interest rates more than their larger rivals were leading the market. The smaller stocks in the Russell 2000 index jumped 2.6%.\n\nReal-estate stocks were also shooting higher. Lower interest rates mean bonds are paying less in interest, which can send potential investors to dividend-paying real-estate owners instead. Office owner Boston Properties jumped 4.8%.\n\nLower interest rates could also pull down mortgage rates and inject energy into the housing market. Homebuilder D.R. Horton climbed 4.8%.\n\nOracle helped lead Wall Street higher with a jump of 12.1% even though it reported weaker profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Financial analysts pointed to strong bookings, including contracts related to artificial-intelligence training.\n\nA furor around AI has helped send stocks to records despite worries about high interest rates and the slowdown in the economy that they induce. Nvidia again was one of the strongest forces pushing the S&P 500 higher, with a gain of 4.4%. The chip company has become the poster child of the AI rush, and its total market value has topped $3 trillion.\n\nThe only company to push more on the S&P 500 than Nvidia was Apple, which jumped 4.4%. Its stock has been jumping the last two days after getting a cool initial reception to the announcement of several AI-related offerings coming to its operating systems.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.26% from 4.40% late Monday and from 4.60% a couple weeks ago. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, slumped to 4.68% from 4.83% late Monday.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, European indexes jumped following the release of the encouraging U.S. inflation data. In Asia, where markets closed before the data came out, indexes were mixed. Japan's Nikkei 225 index lost 0.7% as investors wait for the Bank of Japan's latest announcement on interest rates due Friday.", "source": {"uri": "gvwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GV

It's always great to be back in Montr\u00e9al, my hometown. And I could not be more pleased to be here with Joachim Nagel, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank. Thank you for visiting us in Canada.\n\nSince I'm on my home turf, let me start us off with a few words about where we find ourselves in economic history.\n\nCanada and Germany have just come through the biggest inflation we've experienced in 40 years. And as painful as this has been, it has highlighted some lessons. I will focus on three in the Canadian context.\n\nFirst, we ignore the supply-side of the economy at our peril. As central banks, we tend to focus on the demand side because that's what we influence with interest rates. But coming out of the pandemic, we learned that it is much easier to restore demand than supply. High inflation was a stark reminder that supply shocks can cumulate and persist -- and when they intersect with periods of strong demand, the inflationary consequences can be large. Looking ahead, technological change, geopolitical tensions, climate change, and shifting trade and investment flows all suggest we may experience more supply shocks than we did in the past. Businesses and central banks need to be ready.\n\nSecond, inflation is painful -- that's not a new lesson, but for many of our citizens it was their first experience with high inflation. And it has been painful. Inflation harms people and the economy, and it corrodes trust in our market-based system. The rising cost of living made life harder for everyone, especially those who had less to start with. People were working hard, but their paycheques didn't buy what they used to. That made people feel cheated and angry. Recent history has been a stark reminder that inflation is our common enemy.\n\nThe third lesson is the value of central bank credibility and public trust. We did not have that in the 1970s, and the costs of unwinding inflation were very high. This time, our track record on inflation control combined with our forceful monetary response brought inflation back down at much lower economic cost. But public trust and central bank credibility have been dented by the post-pandemic inflation. To keep the trust we have and to restore what trust we've lost, we need to continue delivering for our citizens. And we need to communicate clearly and broadly. We need to find ways to explain ourselves to a wide range of audiences -- from financial market participants and business owners to families and individuals trying to navigate uncertain economic times. We need to meet people where they are and ensure that they understand what we're doing and why we're doing it.\n\nThat brings me to the present and to the Bank of Canada's immediate focus.\n\nMonetary policy has cooled the economy, inflation has come down, and underlying inflation continues to ease gradually. Last week, the Bank cut its policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.75%. With further and more sustained evidence that underlying inflation is easing, monetary policy no longer needs to be as restrictive as it has been. And last week the European Central Bank also lowered its policy rate. We have come a long way in our collective fight against inflation.\n\nLooking ahead, we still need to get inflation down further to our targets. And I will say that the shared resolve to restore price stability across major central banks has helped us all get inflation down without causing large increases in unemployment.\n\nWe've also learned some lessons from the post-pandemic inflation, and we will take these to heart.\n\nBut the challenges of the future are rarely the same as those of the past. Supply shocks are more likely in the future. New technologies not only have the potential to increase prosperity but also to disrupt. Interest rates may be easing in many economies, but global interest rates are unlikely to return to pre-pandemic levels. The new normal won't be the old normal. And if we're not going back, we'll all need to adjust.\n\nThese shared challenges are why discussions like this one are so important. They help each of us prepare to navigate in a new world.", "source": {"uri": "bankofcanada.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Canada - Bank of Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_shock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supply shock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_Nagel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joachim Nagel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply-side_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply-side economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bundesbank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Bundesbank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_stability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price stability"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/default-og-image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

For the real-time coverage, read our US CPI report from senior strategist Nicholas Cawley.\n\nOn the face of it, it was a good report, seeing headline measures of core and headline inflation come in below expectations on a yearly and monthly basis. Fed officials look to services inflation and super core inflation (services excluding housing and energy) as key gauges of inflation momentum. More recently, officials have been interested to see monthly core cpi breaking the trend of successive 0.4% prints which has now materialized after April's 0.3% and now May's 0.2% .\n\nSource: Refinitiv, Prepared by Richard Snow\n\nLearn how to prepare for high impact economic data or events:\n\nIn the lead up to the inflation print, it is fair to say US equity markets were tentative, consolidating around the recent high. Now, with inflation heading in the right direction again, markets have put a second rate cut back on the table - providing stocks with new vigor.\n\nThe Fed is due to update their dot plot projection of the likely Fed funds rate for 2024. In March, officials projected three quarter-point rate cuts but May's inflation data could see that revised to just two or in an extreme case, one.

Support sits at 1.0795.\n\nYen depreciation and undesirable volatility has plagued Japanese officials for some time now but the latest US CPI data provided some breathing room. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) is due to meet in the early hours of Friday morning where there is likely to be more focus on easing up on aggressive bond buying, allowing the Japanese Government bond yield to rise freely above 1%.

You can, I guess, understand people focusing on inflation, but that should not mean forgetting that an economy is a bit more than how fast prices are rising.\n\nThe shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, displayed his inflation myopia when he recently retweeted a chart showing that among \"peer\" countries of the US, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the eurozone, Australia has had inflation accelerate since December last year.\n\nSuch political lines are understandable, but less clear is why commentators and economists would parrot them.\n\nLast week came the news that Canada's central bank and the European Central Bank (ECB) had cut their interest rates by 25 basis - this, commentators were quick to argue, proved we need higher rates to get inflation below 3%.\n\nFor example, the Australian Financial Review's economics editor, John Kehoe, tweeted in excitement: \"Canada becomes first major economy to cut rates, lifting market mood. This is what happens when you get inflation down to 2.7% and lift the cash rate to 5%. You can cut interest rates! Australia inflation is 3.6% and cash rate 4.35%.\"\n\nFirstly, Canada's cash rate has now been lowered to 4.75%, which is still higher than Australia's current cash rate.\n\nI'm not sure that cutting interest rates to a level still higher than Australia's counts as a win.\n\nAlso, it is worth remembering Australia's inflation began to consistently rise above 3% later than other nations such as the US, UK and Canada. It peaked later as well, and other than the December 2022 jump due to one-off travel prices, our inflation peaked lower:\n\nIf the graph does not display click here\n\nSo it's not surprising that Canada's inflation might have come down earlier. Also given Canada's inflation rose sooner than ours, its central bank (and others) began raising rates sooner than the Reserve Bank of Australia.\n\nThe ECB raised rates to 4.5% - marginally above Australia's current cash rate of 4.35%. Is anyone really arguing that 15 basis points is the difference between getting inflation below 3%?\n\nIf the graph does not display click here\n\nAnd as for the RBA not being tough enough, in the first six months after raising rates, Australia went harder than the US, UK or Canada:\n\nIf the graph does not display click here\n\nSure, the RBA (thankfully) did not increase rates by as much as they did in the US or Canada or the UK, but this is not surprising because our economy is rather different.\n\nRemember that only two months ago the International Monetary Fund released a report that looked at the impact of interest rate rises in 25 major economies.\n\nAustralia was rated as the economy in which monetary policy had the strongest power. The US came in 10th, the UK 17th and Canada 18th.\n\nThe main reason is that a lot more people have fixed rate mortgages in those countries:\n\nIf the graph does not display click here\n\nArguing Australia' interest rates should have gone up as fast and as high as they did in Canada is to argue that Australians should have been hurt more than those in Canada for no reason other than to be able to walk around talking about how tough our central bank is.\n\nEven worse, since March 2022, when inflation began to rise around the world and central banks began raising rates, Canada's unemployment rate rose 0.7 percentage points from 5.4% while Australia's has thus far risen just 0.1 percentage point.\n\nIs this a situation Angus Taylor would like to see occur here, given he seems to envy other \"peer\" economies?\n\nIf the graph does not display click here\n\nWhile Italy's unemployment rate has dropped considerably, it also has the highest rate across all G7 nations. And yes, the ECB cut rates, but the unemployment rate in the eurozone is 6.4%. Does anyone want to change places? Angus?\n\nSimilarly, the percentage of people aged 15-64 with a job in Australia has risen from 76.4% in the March quarter of 2022 to 76.9%, while in Canada it has fallen from 75.2% to 75%:\n\nIf the graph does not display click here\n\nOne very salient point though regarding Canada is that in the past year its wages have risen 5.2% while here they grew 4.1%. That Canada can have stronger wage growth while also having lower inflation than Australia rather dents the argument that wages are the main driver of inflation.\n\nStill, if conservative commentators and politicians here want to call for Australians to get wage rises above 5%, I am all for it!\n\nNone of this is to say Canada's economy is in dire shape, or that the RBA have been geniuses or Australians are doing better than anyone else.\n\nBut this is what a soft landing mostly looks like - inflation coming down slowly while unemployment does not rise too significantly.\n\nThose who salivate over other nations' inflation and interest rates with barely any care for people losing their jobs really need to think about their priorities.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "greg_jericho@theguardian.com", "name": "Greg Jericho", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_Australia", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reserve Bank of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Financial_Review", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Financial Review"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "G20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Taylor_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angus Taylor (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Monetary Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Travel", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7d774b3258d3aea4290d1f6b496fd2423409a0e/549_880_7707_4624/master/7707.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=37cd49084e2ae70e548468d65e351968", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

Their inflation rate is lower than ours, and their unemployment rate has picked up quite a bit more substantially than ours.\n\n\"I think if you took those data out of Canada and you plugged them into the Australian context, you might well see a different policy stance.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the European Central Bank followed suit with a rate cut of its own, lowering its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.75 per cent, even as recent economic data suggested the eurozone was facing a similar scenario to Australia in the form of sticky inflationary prices.\n\nBut Mr Hauser said there was no guarantee that the ECB would continue cutting rates.\n\n\"When I talk as I do to some of the people on the ECB board, they're not all sure where rates are going next,\" he said.\n\n\"So they've been keen, I think, to start the rate cutting cycle to show that they're independent of the US.\n\n\"But whether that goes a lot further and where it goes from here I'm not so sure.\"\n\nIndeed, Europe's measure of underlying inflation, which strips out more volatile food and energy prices, re-accelerated last month to 2.9 per cent, up from 2.7 per cent in April.\n\nInvestors are closely watching for widening dissimilarities between the world's major central banks, which are a major driver in movements across equity and currency markets.\n\nTraders are betting the divergence will be limited so far.\n\nWhile the ECB and the BOC have already moved to cut rates, the BOE and the US Federal Reserve are each expected to also ease monetary policy.\n\nLocally, however, the RBA is expected to be one of the last central banks to lower interest rates, with money markets not pricing in an easing of monetary policy until May 2025.\n\nIn Australia, underlying inflation remains elevated than its international peers. In April, monthly inflation excluding volatile items and holiday travel rose to 4.1 per cent, up from 4 per cent in March.\n\nFresh data released earlier this week showed the RBA's aggressive run of rate hike in the past two years has slowed economic growth to a near standstill in Australia, falling calls from some quarters that governor Michele Bullock and the RBA board should cut rates earlier than anticipated to avoid pushing the economy into a recession.\n\nGDP figures released on Wednesday showed the economy grew by an anaemic 0.1 per cent in the March quarter, a reading which brought annual growth to just 1.1 per cent - its weakest annual result since the early 1990s recession outside the pandemic.", "source": {"uri": "au.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo7 Finance"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_Australia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reserve Bank of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Australian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_1990s_recession_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Early 1990s recession in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Money market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/WJfRElmwCwbTSZX4BixWPg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/nca_newswire_finance_105/9e84aa4493d2708d202b37609e231f8a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

Inflation has cooled since its post-pandemic peak.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that inflation rates across the U.S. cooled in April and May, but it varies by state.\n\nHowever, four years later, consumers are still feeling the effects of inflation in everyday budgeting. Has it gotten any better in Colorado?\n\nA recent study by WalletHub analyzed how inflation rates differ across 23 of the country's major metro areas.\n\nThe nationwide year-over-year inflation rate sits at 3.3% as of May, according to the study, which, despite the recent cooling, is still above the target rate of 2%. Meanwhile, some metro areas are seeing a year-over-year inflation rate of 5% and higher.\n\nAccording to WalletHub, prices have been inflating at a rate of 0.6% locally from March to May.\n\nThe course of last year is a different story. The year-over-year inflation rate in Denver, according to WalletHub, is at 2.6% as of May.\n\nWhile the inflation rate is enough for Denverites and their wallets to feel the impact, it's not nearly as bad as it is in many other metro areas across the country.\n\nOut of the 23 cities WalletHub analyzed, the Denver-Lakewood-Aurora metro area tied with the Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Massachusetts and Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, California metro areas for the fifth lowest inflation rate over the last few months.\n\nAs for last year, the Denver metro area's 2.6% inflation rate tied with that of the Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, Arizona and Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, Minnesota/Wisconsin metro areas for the second lowest rate. The only lower year-over-year rate in the study was at 1.8% in the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida metro area.\n\nAccording to the study, inflation rates over the last year around Denver were half that of inflation rates near Honolulu and just over half that of Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, Texas.\n\nCities with the highest year-over-year inflation:\n\nCities with the lowest year-over-year inflation:\n\nCities with the highest inflation rate since March:\n\nCities with the lowest inflation rate since March:\n\nThe Denver metro area ranked 21 overall on WalletHub's list of 23 major U.S. metro areas with the biggest inflation problems.

Subscribe now to Alpha Reports and up your game!\n\nThe prices of Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies popped Wednesday after a widely watched inflation gauge showed that U.S. consumer prices increased last month by less than economists had expected.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.3% in the 12 months through May, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said Wednesday, coming in slightly below economists' forecast of 3.4%. Previously, the index tracking American goods and services showed that consumer prices rose 3.4% annually.\n\nImmediately following the report's release, Bitcoin jumped 2.8% to around $69,500 from $67,900. Other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum and Solana, showed gains of over 3% over the past day, but their prices had still fallen over the past week after Friday's flash crash.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite opened in the green. The move came just hours before the Federal Reserve's June policy meeting, where the U.S. central bank is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady for an 11th straight month.\n\nAs the Fed's decision loomed, Bitcoin is nearing a price of $70,000 as of this writing, showing gains of over 4% over the past day, according to CoinGecko.\n\nOn a month-to-month basis, U.S. inflation was flat. The reading followed a 0.3% bump in consumer prices in April and a 0.4% increase in March and February.\n\nWhile investors had already anticipated that Fed policymakers would leave interest rates untouched Wednesday, rate cut hopes for September strengthened, however. That chance rose after the report's release to 62% from 46%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n\nLikely delivering a boost to the U.S. economy through lower borrowing costs, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last month that policymakers need \"greater confidence\" that inflation is heading to its target of 2% annually before loosening monetary policy through rate cuts.\n\nShifting rate cut expectations dented Bitcoin's price in April, knocking the cryptocurrency away from all-time highs above $73,000 a month prior. However, analysts say Bitcoin could test those prices again as a path toward rate cuts emerges with more certainty and a weaker U.S. dollar.\n\n\"At this point, my confidence in Fed rate cuts is pretty high,\" Grayscale's Head of Research Zach Pandl said on Twitter (aka X), adding that rate cuts becoming a base case again is good for the strength of Bitcoin relative to the dollar in a separate post.\n\nMarkets largely shrugged at hotter-than-expected U.S. job growth last Friday. Still, hours after the figures were released, Bitcoin plunged alongside the rest of the crypto market, causing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of liquidations in leveraged crypto positions.\n\nOn Wednesday, the dollar value of liquidated positions was comparatively muted. Within the past four hours, $10 million worth of crypto long positions have been purged, while bearish traders saw $39 million worth of short positions be closed, per data from CoinGlass.", "source": {"uri": "decrypt.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Decrypt"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andre_beganski@decrypt.co", "name": "Andr\u00e9 Beganski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goods and services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_flash_crash", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2010 flash crash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq_Composite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq Composite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Short (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/height/512/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/prices-bitcoin-market-inflation-gID_7.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

The decision comes after US stocks earlier touched record highs on softer-than-expected inflation data. Economists have widely been expecting officials to pencil in one or two rate cuts this year, instead of the three they forecast in March.\n\nUAE holds interest rates steady\n\nShortly after the Fed's announcement, the UAE Central Bank said it's keeping its interest rate unchanged.\n\n\"The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has decided to maintain the Base Rate applicable to the Overnight Deposit Facility (ODF) without change at 5.40 per cent,\" it said in a statement.\n\n\"This decision was taken following the US Federal Reserve's announcement today to keep the interest on Reserve Balances (IORB) unchanged.\"\n\nThe CBUAE has also decided to maintain the interest rate applicable to borrowing short-term liquidity from the CBUAE at 50 basis points above the Base Rate for all standing credit facilities.\n\n(The Base Rate, which is anchored to the US Federal Reserve's IORB, signals the general stance of monetary policy and provides an effective floor for overnight money market interest rates in the UAE.)\n\nWary of cutting rates too soon\n\nThe latest announcement suggests that the US central bank officials remain wary about cutting rates too soon, despite consumer inflation data published earlier Wednesday, which pointed to a slowdown in the rate of price increases in May.\n\nAlongside its interest rate decision, the Fed also updated economic forecasts from the members of its rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Policymakers lowered their individual forecasts for the number of rate cuts they expect this year.\n\nThis means that FOMC participants only expect one 0.25 percentage point cut before year-end, two less than in the last update in March.

U.S. motorists have benefited from cheaper gasoline in recent weeks, with the average price of regular around the U.S. at $3.45, down from $3.62 a month ago and from $3.59 at the same time in 2023, according to AAA.

The base case for most equity investors on the FOMC meeting was: 1) few if any changes in the economic outlook, and 2) the majority of Fed officials indicating they supported two rate cuts this year. Policymakers delivered on the former, but not the latter. The economic outlook was essentially unchanged, though the 12-member committee did change the inflation outlook, saying \"there has been modest further progress\" rather than an earlier view that \"there has been a lack of further progress\" in capping inflation. On rate cuts, the majority supported only one rate cut, not two, and four were in favor of no rate cuts. That is a disappointment. It's a disappointment because so much of an additional leg up in the market is centered around this \"Fed pivot,\" where the Fed moves from keeping rates high to cutting rates. That would be the signal they are winning the fight against inflation. So why was the S & P 500, up 56 points prior to the announcement, only off a few points from that level immediately after? I think it has to do with the market conditions. Here is what we have: disinflation, still-strong jobs, rising earnings and a big new tech paradigm in the form of Artificial Intelligence that is powering much of the gains. That is not a recipe for a declining market. Many have taken to comparing 2024 to 1995. There are some similarities: the Fed began cutting rates that year, inflation (as measured by the personal consumption expenditures index, the Fed's preferred gauge) was falling, earnings were rising, and there was also a shiny new tech paradigm, this one called the internet, that had just begun to capture the public's imagination ( Netscape had just gone public in a sensational debut in August of that year). So investors did not get the two rate cuts they wanted. What's the implication? For the short term, it likely means that a lot of money sitting on the sidelines waiting for that \"Fed pivot\" will likely stay on the sidelines. But when compared to the main drivers of this market (disinflation, still-strong jobs, rising earnings, and a big new tech paradigm in the form of Artificial Intelligence) it's only a modest disappointment.", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bob_pisani@cnbc.com", "name": "Bob Pisani", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paradigm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disinflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107390096-17109471052024-03-20t100145z_1159386497_rc2lp6atrkcn_rtrmadp_0_usa-fed.jpeg?v=1713976464&w=1920&h=1080", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

Everything is more expensive, and unless you are extremely wealthy, there's no real way to escape the repercussions.\n\nOf course, the fact that inflation has driven prices up over 20 percent since Joe Biden took office isn't it for American families, though that alone has caused enough pain. Because the Federal Reserve wants to lower inflation, they have more than doubled interest rates, leading to skyrocketing mortgage rates. In 2020, you could realistically get a 30-year fixed FHA loan for around 2.5 percent. Today, that number is closer to seven percent with conventional rates going even higher.\n\nFor many who had plans to buy a home, they simply can't anymore due to mortgage payments going up by as much as 60 percent. Unfortunately, no relief was found after the Fed finished meeting on Wednesday, and it looks like \"Bidenomics\" will continue to haunt Americans for the foreseeable future.\n\nRELATED: Biden Refuses to Own Up to Housing Inflation\n\nThe Federal Reserve said Wednesday it is keeping its benchmark lending rates at their current levels for the seventh time in a row, while signaling fewer rate cuts than previously estimated.\n\nThat means borrowing costs on everything from car loans to mortgages will remain elevated.\n\nOfficials penciled in just one rate cut this year, according to their latest economic projections, compared to the three they forecast in March. They also expect inflation to be more stubborn this year than they thought in the spring, according to their forecasts.\n\nThere is some talk of a single cut this year happening in the fall, but there's little reason to believe anything the Fed projects at this point. They projected three rate cuts at the beginning of the year. None of those have materialized yet.\n\nWhat does this all mean? It means that the primary way for middle-class (and ever lower-class) Americans to build wealth remains out of reach for most. Instead of building equity in a property, working-class people will be forced to keep setting their money on fire by paying ever-increasing rent payments. The rich have other ways of getting richer. Mere normals are stuck.\n\nNone of this had to happen. Biden could have come into office and made tough decisions regarding how to balance unemployment and inflation. Instead, he did what he thought was the easy thing, which is to pay trillions in new and completely unnecessary spending. That bill has come due, and Biden isn't the one paying it.

You'll be hearing about this report constantly for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Biden administration will use this data to project economic strength and argue that inflation is finally under control. The better than expected report deserves a closer look, however, and requires a perspective that yields analysis more nuanced than simply stating that \"inflation is down.\"\n\nThe slight cooling came predominantly from a 3.6% decrease in gas prices. A more important aspect of the consumer price index is shelter inflation, however, which broadly measures housing costs.\n\nThat figure rose 0.4% during the month of May and 5.4% over the year.\n\nInflation and cost of living are not the same thing. The former may have cooled last month, sure, but the latter did not. High rent prices have a far more significant impact on individuals and families than a slight drop in gas prices.\n\nTwo-thirds of the annual increase in inflation is due to shelter prices. The disproportionate impact this metric has on the consumer price index has been contributing significantly to the difficulty of reining in inflation.\n\nThe cost of a median-priced home has more than doubled since Biden took office, according to the Heritage Foundation. Combine that with high interest rates and the aforementioned rent increases, and it's easy to see why people aren't feeling too optimistic about their finances.\n\nThat disconnect between inflation and the cost of living is central to why Biden is struggling so much to convince the public that the economy is booming. He can cite job growth, a low unemployment rate, and this most recent inflation report as much as he wants, but those metrics aren't nearly as important as he would like to believe.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nA family with two children still won't be able to outbid a private equity firm on a house no matter how many jobs are added to the economy next month.

That's a welcome sign that tees up the possibility the Federal Reserve will signal plans to cut interest rates later today.\n\nA rare one-two punch of economic news that will indicate whether the fight against inflation is being won makes Wednesday one of the most important days of the year for economic news, CNBC reports. This morning's consumer price report from the Department of Labor was an encouraging sign, and all eyes now turn to this afternoon's decision by the central bank's officials. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates 11 times since March 2022 to help combat inflation, and those increases have made mortgage rates, car loans, and other forms of credit more expensive. The central bank has not raised rates since July, when it set the baseline interest rate just north of 5 percent, but it hasn't cut them either.\n\nFor the past year, the tug-of-war between inflation and interest rates has been a stalemate. After falling to a post-2022 low of 3 percent in June 2023, inflation has bubbled back upwards in recent months. At its last meeting in May, the Federal Reserve declared \"a lack of further progress\" in combating inflation.\n\nThis morning's consumer price index report showed prices holding steady after increasing by at least 0.3 percent in each of the past four months. Food prices remained mostly flat and energy prices fell during May, but services and housing continued to get more expensive.\n\nEven a hopeful inflation report is unlikely to have an immediate impact on the Fed's decision about interest rates. \"Officials are widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged, no matter what happens. But the fresh inflation reading could help shape officials' estimates of how many times they will cut rates this year, because policymakers will have a chance to update their forecasts in response to the data,\" writes Jeanna Smialek, The New York Times' Federal Reserve reporter.\n\nHowever, \"a well-behaved May inflation report is a likely prerequisite for the Fed to consider lowering interest rates after that, as officials have said they want to see a series of readings that rebuilds their confidence inflation will head lower,\" The Wall Street Journal explained.\n\nAmericans are understandably eager to see both inflation and interest rates fall toward the historically low levels that were enjoyed before the COVID-19 pandemic. We are likely still a long way from that point, but today may turn out to be a significant turning point in the ongoing battle against higher prices and more expensive debt.\n\nHunter Biden, the president's son, was convicted of three felony gun crimes on Tuesday. All three counts are related to the younger Biden's 2018 purchase of a handgun, which he was not legally allowed to own because of his track record of using illegal drugs.\n\nBiden was never accused of threatening or harming anyone with the handgun, and he likely never would have been prosecuted at all if he hadn't revealed in a 2021 memoir that he'd been addicted to crack cocaine around the time that he'd bought the gun. (Never memoir, kids.) Yes, there's arguably a good reason for the government to try to prevent reckless drug abusers from owning guns, but this overly broad intersection of federal anti-gun and anti-drug laws doesn't make much practical sense, as Reason's Jacob Sullum explained yesterday:\n\nJudging from survey data on drug use and gun ownership, something like 20 million Americans are committing that felony right now. The Justice Department prosecutes only a minuscule percentage of those potential defendants. That is partly because such cases are not a high priority, which tells you something about the logic of treating this offense as a felony that is currently punishable by up to 15 years in prison (thanks to legislation that Biden's father signed in 2022, which also created a new potential charge in cases like this).\n\nBiden could get up to 25 years in prison for these crimes, though it is unlikely that he'll be given the maximum penalty. Congress should change the law so that less privileged individuals are also spared the threat of federal prison simply in similar circumstances.\n\nAn end to gerontocracy? Voters in North Dakota on Tuesday approved a ballot measure that sets a maximum age for the state's U.S. representatives and senators. The ballot measure amends the state's constitution to prohibit candidates from running if they would turn 81 years old (or older) during their term in office.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution sets minimum ages for office-holders (25 for House, 30 for Senate, 35 for president), and I've argued before that setting upper limits on who can be elected to those positions makes a lot of sense. But North Dakota's anti-octogenarian rule will likely have to survive a court challenge. As The New York Times notes, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1995 that states may not restrict eligibility for federal offices beyond the age limits written into the Constitution.\n\nThere is, of course, one surefire way to free America from the doddering ancients who run much of the federal government: Stop voting for them.\n\nScenes from Washington, D.C.: A popular caf\u00e9 in Washington's ossified Georgetown neighborhood might be forced to close by a combination of stupid zoning laws and grumpy neighbors (who are eager to use those stupid zoning laws to drive away a successful business.) A neighborhood commission has formally asked the city government to yank Call Your Mother's permits and force it to close, Axios reports, due to \"large crowds\" and \"objectionable conditions.\"\n\nThis is, I hasten to note, a shop that primarily sells bagels and coffee -- not a raging nightclub or noisy bar. But, of course, Washington is a city populated almost entirely by people who desire to meddle in the affairs of others.", "source": {"uri": "reason.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reason"},

This needs to become the trend after a series of far too hot readings at the start of the year. We think it will be and with unemployment on the rise we expect the Fed to cut rates in September.\n\nAfter a string of far too high inflation prints at the start of the year we are now seeing some much better readings. The April core PCE deflator came in at 0.2% and today's core CPI for May has repeated the feat (0.2% versus the 0.3% consensus) and to 3 decimal places is even better at 0.163% month-on-month. At the same time headline consumer price inflation came in at 0.0% MoM versus the 0.1% consensus and is below every single forecast. The year-on-year headline rate slows to 3.3% from 3.4% and core slows to 3.4% from 3.6%, but the focus is on the MoM run rate and today's outcome has boosted the chances of a September start point for rate cuts considerably.\n\nLooking at the details we have to thank a 3.6% MoM drop in airfares for doing a lot of the heavy lifting in getting the soft core inflation print, but the prices of recreation, new vehicles and apparel all fell too. An important story is that motor vehicle insurance prices also dropped. This has been an 'engine' of inflation pressures in recent months and today's developments are a real relief (YoY it is still up 20.3% though).\n\nThere are areas of lingering strength in pricing power. The housing numbers aren't really showing any softening with owners' equivalent rent holding at +0.4% MoM for the fourth consecutive month and primary rents doing the same. Used car prices rose 0.6%, but this is unlikely to last given movement in Manheim used car auction prices which lead the used price car series by a couple of months. Medical care prices also remain hot, rising 0.5%.\n\nNonetheless all other components were in the 0-0.2% range, which is what we want to see and this ties in with what the Fed wrote about price pressures in its most recent Beige Book, \"prices increased at a modest pace over the reporting period. Contacts in most Districts noted consumers pushed back against additional price increases, which led to smaller profit margins as input prices rose on average\".\n\nToday's outcome following on from the April core PCE deflator and the Beige Book summary should give the Fed the confidence to amend the sentence in the FOMC statement that previously said \"In recent months, there has been a lack of further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective\". It should also allow a dovish spin from the Fed's Powell this afternoon even if the Fed themselves surprise and switch to projecting just one rate cut from the three cuts they projected at their March forecast update.\n\nWe think the Fed will opt for two in their forecast update, but remember the forecasts were submitted well ahead of the recent data prints. Expectations for a September rate cut have risen, but not significantly with 20bp of a 25bp cut now priced. A November cut is fully priced with 49bp of cuts priced by year-end.\n\nWe look for a September start point for rate cuts with additional cuts in November and December. What we think will generate such an outcome is 1) two or three more 0.2% MoM core inflation prints, 2) unemployment convincingly breaking above 4% to say 4.2% or 4.3% and 3) more softening in consumer spending.\n\nMore By This Author:", "source": {"uri": "talkmarkets.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TalkMarkets"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Spain", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Consumer Price Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Used_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Used car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beige_Book", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beige Book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Auction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vehicle insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clothing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Profit margin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Publishing_and_Printing/Printing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Publishing and Printing/Printing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Small_Business/Home_Office", "label": "dmoz/Business/Small Business/Home Office", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Laser_Games/Zone_Empire", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Laser Games/Zone Empire", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/590022/pexels-photo-590022.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=750&w=1260", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

At the same time, it would be only appropriate for Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb to remember that an important part of his job is preventing cuts in the Public Sector Development Plan. Already, the targeted growth of 3.6 percent seems anaemic, not just by the needs of the populace, but also by historical trends. It should not be forgotten that Investment + Savings = Gross National Product. Investment includes government development spending, so if the PDSP is cut, GDP growth is reduced. The government doesn't want that.\n\nAt the same time, it does not want inflation making a comeback. If the country had been in a recession, or even a depression, it might have taken the risk. However, pump-priming is something the IMF will not stand for. At the same time, Mr Aurangzeb would do well to keep reminding himself that everything is interconnected.

It angers them and angers me that you have to spend more. It's like 20% less for the same price. That's corporate greed. That's corporate greed. And we have got to deal with it. And that's what I'm working on.\" - President Biden via CNN\n\nYes, prices have certainly gone up due to inflation. However, that wasn't the fault of corporations. The surge in inflation directly resulted from the supply-to-demand imbalance caused by shutting down the economy (supply) and increasing household purchasing power by sending them checks (demand).\n\nFor the majority of Americans who now get their \"news\" from social media, the uneducated masses now have a new target of hatred for their financial woes - corporate greed.\n\nA Claim Of Absurdity\n\nThe problem, as with many of the narratives ramping up the ire of Americans on social media, is it is patently false.\n\nAs Michael Maharrey previously penned:\n\n\"One simply has to reason through the claim to uncover the absurdity. If corporations can willy-nilly raise prices and enjoy \"excessive\" profits, why don't they do it all the time? Did corporations suddenly get greedy in 2021? And why did the Federal Reserve spend a decade fretting about inflation being 'too low' as it struggled to hit its 2% target? Was there not enough corporate greed before coronavirus?\"\n\nWhen you think about it this way, something else apparently happened.\n\nLet's begin with Powell's assessment of the cause of inflation.\n\n\"The ongoing episode of high inflation initially emerged from a collision between very strong demand and pandemic-constrained supply. By the time the Federal Open Market Committee raised the policy rate in March 2022, it was clear that bringing down inflation would depend on both the unwinding of the unprecedented pandemic-related demand and supply distortions and on our tightening of monetary policy, which would slow the growth of aggregate demand, allowing supply time to catch up.\"\n\nIt's crucial to note the complete dismissal of the causes behind the \"collision between robust demand and pandemic-constrained supply.\" I suspect this was intentional in avoiding placing blame at the feet of the current or previous administrations or themselves. However, it muddies the impact of their actions that created the problem.\n\nThe following economic illustration is taught in every \"Econ 101\" class. Unsurprisingly, inflation is the consequence if supply is restricted and demand increases via monetary interventions.\n\nWho had the power to shut down the entire economy and force everyone into their homes using a fear-driven campaign? Was it the war, corporations, or the Government? Who then supplied trillions in stimulus checks directly to households to spend when no supply could be produced? Was that corporations? Russia? Or was it the Government? Who supported the issuance of trillions in debt issuance to fund those stimulus checks and keep interest rates suppressed? Was that the Federal Reserve, Russia, or corporations? Was it corporations that put a moratorium on student loans, rent, and mortgage payments, giving individuals a source of additional funds to spend? Or was it the Government?\n\nMilton Friedman also had much to say on this issue.\n\nCorporate Greed Does Not Cause Inflation\n\nRegarding inflation, many armchair economists are quick to quote Milton Friedman.\n\n\"Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.\"\n\nThe problem is there is much more to Friedman's statement on the cause of inflation.\n\nAs Milton Friedman once stated, corporations don't cause inflation; governments create inflation by printing money.\n\n\"It is always and everywhere a result of too much money, of a more rapid increase of money, than of output. Moreover, in the modern era, the important next step is to recognize that today the governments control the quantity of money so that, as a result, inflation in the United States is made in Washington and nowhere else. Of course, no government any more than any of us, likes to responsibility for bad things.\n\nAll of us are humans. If something bad happens, it wasn't our fault. And the government is the same way, so it doesn't accept responsibility for inflation. If you listen to people in Washington talk, they will tell you that inflation is produced by greedy businessmen, or it's produced by grasping unions, or it's produced by spendthrift consumers, or maybe its those terrible Arab sheiks who are producing it.\"\n\nAs he concludes:\n\n\"But none of them produce inflation, for the very simple reason that neither the businessmen, not the trade union, nor the housewife have a printing press in their basement on which they can turn out those green pieces of paper we call money. Only Washington has the printing press, and therefore, only Washington can produce inflation.\"\n\nThe inflation surge has nothing to do with corporate greed taking advantage of consumers but rather the actions of the Federal Reserve and the Government. The cause of inflation was the economic consequence of \"too much money chasing too few goods.\"\n\nMilton Friedman's statement is supported by the chart below showing the M2 money supply compared to inflation (with a 16-month lag).\n\nYou can watch Milton's entire speech on \"Money and Inflation.\"\n\nCorporations Respond to Inflation\n\nSo, if it isn't corporate greed, why are corporations raising prices so much on everything?\n\nCorporations have a responsibility to their shareholders to remain in business. If the costs to their business increase (i.e., wages, benefits, commodities, utilities, etc.), such must be factored into the selling price to maintain profitability. Crucially, corporations can only pass on higher input costs to consumers if demand remains higher than the available supply of those goods or services.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, corporations could pass on most of the inflationary increase to consumers as they were willing to spend the Government's money. However, as excess savings run out, inflation declines as consumers decrease spending. Corporate profits weaken as the ability to pass on higher input costs to customers fades. As shown, as inflation declines, the rate of change in corporate profits also weakens.\n\nWe see the same if you use a two-year average of corporate profits minus inflation. Again, when inflation surged in 2020, corporations could pass on the bulk of the cost increases to consumers. Today, as inflation slows due to declining demand, corporations must absorb the inflation to sell products or services.\n\nAnother way to view this issue is by comparing the spread between the consumer price index (what consumers pay for goods and services) and the producer price index (what corporations pay). When inflation rises, and consumer demand exceeds supply, corporations can pass on higher input costs to consumers. Corporations absorb higher input costs when inflation declines to sell products or services.\n\nHere is the crucial point:\n\n\"Corporations don't create inflation. They merely react to changes in demand and adjust pricing and supply to maintain profitability. When the consumer slows down, corporations cut prices to reduce supply.\"\n\nWho Is Responsible For Inflation?\n\nIf there is a \"greed factor\" in inflation, it is more of a function of political policy and Wall Street. Let's start with political policies.\n\nMost government policies are passed to appease the masses in one form or another, but mostly to appease those who fund campaigns to keep them in office. We have already addressed the side effects of shuttering the economy and sending checks to households while halting debt payments. That had nothing to do with corporate greed, but the voting base was happy getting \"free money.\"\n\nThere are also policies pushed at the state level that result in higher inflation but keep politicians in office. For example, California's minimum wage hike to $22/hour is an inflationary policy. Corporations' obvious response is to raise prices to offset the higher wage costs.\n\nAs discussed in \"$15/Hour Cost & Consequences,\" wage increases are not a \"free lunch.\" To wit:\n\n\"Labor costs are the highest expense to any business. It's not just the actual wages, but also payroll taxes, benefits, paid vacation, healthcare, etc. Employees are not cheap, and that cost must be covered by the goods or services sold. Therefore, if the consumer refuses to pay more, the costs have to be offset elsewhere.\n\nFor example, after Walmart and Target announced higher minimum wages, layoffs occurred and cashiers were replaced with self-checkout counters. Restaurants added surcharges to help cover the costs of higher wages, a \"tax\" on consumers, and chains like McDonald's, and Panera Bread, replaced cashiers with apps and ordering kiosks.\"\n\nFurthermore, Wall Street itself is a factor. Prices of commodities are controlled by traders on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Those traders look for opportunities to place bets on commodities based on many events that could impact supply, such as weather, transportation disruptions, or geopolitical conflicts. Take a look at the commodity index below.\n\nThat surge in commodity prices, which resulted from the economic shutdown, raises the cost of input prices to corporations. That additional cost must be accounted for in the production process and is ultimately passed on to the consumer.\n\nThis isn't corporate greed. The increased cost to consumers is a byproduct of Wall Street raising the price of commodities to gain profit from supply disruptions.\n\nWhile it is easy to blame corporate greed for higher prices, it is not the fault of corporations. As noted, corporations are responding to higher input costs to maintain profitability for both shareholders and to remain in business.\n\nNo, corporate greed is not responsible for inflation.\n\nYes, it is a nice fantasy that corporations should eat higher costs and be benefactors to consumers.\n\nHowever, corporations are not charities.\n\n________________\n\nLance Roberts is a Chief Portfolio Strategist/Economist for RIA Advisors.

Despite persistent wage and service inflation, the cooling job market and stalling economy suggest a need for rate cuts.\n\nThe Bank of England will start cutting interest rates in August, according to all but two of 65 economists polled by Reuters, and most of them expect at least one more reduction this year despite persistently high pay and services inflation.\n\nOne of the first central banks to start raising rates following the worst of the COVID pandemic, the BoE lifted Bank Rate by 515 basis points between December 2021 and August 2023 to a 16-year high of 5.25% to tackle soaring price pressures in the economy. Overall inflation eased to 2.3% in April, close to the central bank's 2.0% target, from a peak of 11.1% in October 2022. A hot job market has started slowing and official statistics on Wednesday showed the economy stalled in April, partly due to exceptionally rainy weather.\n\nHowever, wage and services inflation, both watched closely by the BoE, are still around 6%. Only two of 65 economists polled expected the BoE to wait until September to cut rates instead of August. But all 24 who participated in both the latest and last month's poll and had previously forecast a cut on June 20 moved their call to August.\n\nFinancial markets are pricing only one BoE rate cut this year, in September. \"While we are seeing some tentative signs of cooling in the labour market, service sector inflation remains persistently high and it is likely the MPC would want to wait until the next set of forecasts and a few more data points before it embarks on its first rate cut,\" said Yael Selfin, chief UK economist at KPMG.\n\nOne set of labour market data and two more inflation releases are due before the Monetary Policy Committee meets in August, when it next releases detailed quarterly forecasts. Asked if any other MPC members would vote for a rate cut in June - as Dave Ramsden and Swati Dhingra did in May - about three-quarters or 22 of 30 economists, who responded said No. The rest said Yes.\n\nThe poll median forecast showed Bank Rate would be a half-point lower at year-end. It was forecast at 5.00% at end-September and 4.75% at end-year, compared with 4.75% and 4.50%, respectively, in last month's poll. Just over half of economists, 35 of 65, forecast two 25 basis point Bank Rate reductions to 4.75% by end-2024. Over one-third, 24 of 65, predicted 75 basis points of cuts to 4.50%, with three economists expecting Bank Rate even lower at 4.25%. The remaining three expected only one cut this year to 5.00%.\n\nThat prediction was similar to expectations for two quarter-point cuts this year by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which will announce its latest policy decision later on Wednesday but is not expected to cut rates until September at the earliest. The European Central Bank started its cutting cycle on June 6 but with expectations policymakers there are in no hurry to follow up with a second one.\n\nUK inflation was predicted to average slightly above the BoE's target of 2.0% across all quarters until at least the end of 2025, according to the poll. Median forecasts showed inflation averaging 2.5% this year and 2.2% next. The economy was forecast to grow 0.3% in every quarter until end-2025, unchanged from last month's poll.\n\nOver 2024 the economy was forecast to expand 0.7%, faster than last month's 0.5% prediction. Growth was predicted to accelerate to 1.2% and 1.4% in the following two years, respectively.

Fed swaps showed traders still favored at least two rate cuts this year despite the central bank's guidance. As recently as this morning, swaps contracts were pricing in quarter-point rate cuts in November and December.\n\n\"The Fed adjusts their dot plots accordingly, so they change all the time and stock traders know that,\" Scott Colyer, chief executive at Advisors Asset Management, said over the phone. \"It's clear the Fed really wants to cut rates at least one time this year. And those cuts, even if just once, will still be supportive for stock prices.\"\n\nNow, investors are parsing Chair Jerome Powell's press conference in Washington, looking for signals on whether the market's aggressive dovish bid earlier this morning is now overdone after data released Wednesday morning showed inflation cooling for a second month in May.\n\nTraders had hoped that the encouraging consumer price index print represented the early stages of inflation resuming a downward trend after remaining stubbornly high for most of the year. However, the numbers also gave credence to the wait-and-see approach highlighted by Powell and a chorus of Fed speakers after the latest strong jobs report fueled the debate over how restrictive monetary policy actually is.\n\n\"Dots being more hawkish than anticipated has taken some of the fluff off the move today, but we need to see how the rest of the presser is digested,\" said Dave Lutz, head of ETFs at JonesTrading. \"Feels like with only the BOJ remaining this week, we could see the VIX fade, and stocks close near highs.\"\n\nDan Suzuki, deputy chief investment officer at Richard Bernstein Advisors:\n\n\"Investors need to come to terms with the fact that the Fed is not in the driver's seat. They are simply responding to inflation, which is responding to growth. Until growth breaks meaningfully to the upside or downside, inflation is likely to stay stubbornly above the Fed's target and you're unlikely to see any aggressive moves from the Fed.\"\n\nMarvin Loh, senior macro strategist at State Street Global Markets:\n\n\"The Fed seems increasingly divided on how the economy will evolve this year, which is shown in the nearly equally divided view on where funds will wind up this year. Looking into 2025 and 2026 however, the dots suggest that once they begin, they are increasingly comfortable that they can move towards normalization more quickly. This is neutral to dovish despite the reduction to only 1-cut this year.\"\n\nJay Hatfield, chief executive officer at Infrastructure Capital Advisors:\n\n\"We do need to at least get the first cut behind us, and then we think we'll be off to the races in a broader rally. It's going to come from weakening economic growth and weakening labor market. That's what's going to induce them to make the first cut. Because any reasonable forecast would show that -- I think the fed's too conservative at 2.8 -- but that we're going to stall out.\"\n\nMohamed El-Erian, the president of Queens' College, Cambridge and a Bloomberg Opinion columnist:\n\n\"The one question I would have for Chairman Powell is, 'Do those numbers and the expectations that four people had for no rate cuts reflect this morning's inflation data or not?'\"\n\nKevin Caron, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors\n\n\"Even though the dots plot says one cut this year, I don't think we should be surprised at that, given the fact that the Fed's message has not changed when it comes to inflation: they want convincing evidence that we're on a sustainable path to 2%. That is going to take several months.\n\nAlex Cohen, FX strategist, Bank of America Corp.\n\n\"The dots read hawkish -- or maybe cautious is the better word -- on the margin, with just one cut for 2024. I think that explains why the USD has pared back a bit of the more notable depreciation from CPI. Unclear though if members would have changed their dot on back of CPI or not, so maybe that's something that comes up in the presser.\"\n\nJason Barsema, president & co-founder of Halo Investing Inc.\n\n\"Today's revision to the Fed's dot plot, and likely more to come into '25, sets the market up for an entertaining tug-of-war between equity and bond traders this summer. With the rally to date in equity markets, investors should consider taking advantage of investment grade bonds in the middle of the curve to lock in yields and be 'cautiously defensive' within equity portfolios.\"\n\n--With assistance from Natalia Kniazhevich, Nazmul Ahasan, Carter Johnson, Matthew Griffin and Norah Mulinda.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq-100", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq-100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacifism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pacifism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "VIX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_investment_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief investment officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merchant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Choir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Street_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State Street Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens'_College,_Cambridge", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queens' College, Cambridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(statistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Normalization (statistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_A._El-Erian", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed A.

Housing costs also weighed on the poll participants. That's despite a majority of respondents reporting optimism about household finances over the next year thanks to stable employment and wage increases.\n\n\"The inflation rate is growing less quickly, but you're still finding things are much more expensive than they were just a couple of years ago,\" Charlie Wise, senior vice president at TransUnion, said in an interview. \"Consumers generally don't differentiate between inflation and prices. So inflation continues to be a bigger and bigger concern.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve is expected at its meeting Wednesday to maintain rates at a 23-year high as inflation remains stubbornly above its target. As a result, even consumers with good credit are seeing interest rates on bank loans that are more than twice as high as they were a few years ago.\n\nTo make ends meet, nearly six in 10 respondents said they cut back on discretionary spending -- like dining out, travel, and entertainment -- in the past three months. And about the same percentage plan to apply for a new credit card, the highest level of intent that the credit firm's quarterly survey has recorded. Indeed, government data is showing elevated amounts of debt on credit cards.\n\nIn the poll, 48% reported that the rate of inflation was outpacing their income. Older generations were the most stressed, with 56% of those born between 1965 and 1980 and 53% of baby boomers, who are older than 60, saying that their household finances haven't kept up.

Shortly afterward, Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman reacted to the data, expressing optimism about the economy's future.\n\nWhat Happened: Krugman posted on the social media platform X shortly after the report was released.\n\nCPI inflation slowed to 3.3% on a year-over-year basis in May and was 0% on a monthly basis. Krugman's post refers to inflation data excluding inflation from shelter costs. Since this adjusted rate falls below the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target, Krugman declared that \"inflation has basically been defeated.\"\n\nWhy it Matters: Many economists, including Krugman, have preferred core inflation excluding shelter and energy. Shelter inflation typically lags behind other changes in market prices. Research, including a 2022 study from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, suggests that shelter inflation artificially elevates core inflation data for several quarters.\n\nKrugman has been known for his previous dovish sentiment on inflation data and Federal Reserve interest rate policy; the economist similarly stated that the \"inflation bump is over\" following positive Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data in May. In September 2023, Krugman declared the war on inflation \"pretty much won.\"\n\nThe Federal Funds Rate has been at an elevated level for several quarters, but betting markets such as Kalshi now forecast two rate cuts by the end of the year.\n\nAlso Read: US Median Housing Rent Jumps To $1,653, Highest Since 2022: 'Demand From Young Renters Remains High'\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Krugman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Krugman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Consumer Price Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_consumption_expenditures_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal consumption expenditures price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Median"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Storage", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master_Data_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master Data Management", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Data_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Data Centers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Data_Administration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Data Administration", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXNPEB6R0AQ_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

Markets expect core inflation y/y to nudge 0.1% lower to 3.5%, while headline inflation is expected to remain unchanged at 3.4%. Any notable deviation from these forecasts would fuel a spike in market volatility.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, scheduled for later today, is expected to leave interest rates unchanged within the current range of 5.25% to 5.5%. However, the main event will revolve around the release of the latest Summary of Economic Projections and the closely watched \"dot plot\" visualization.\n\nThe dot plot is a crucial tool that illustrates where FOMC officials anticipate interest rates to be at the end of the current year and the subsequent two years. The March dot plot revealed a range of opinions, with two officials expecting rates to remain static, two anticipating a single rate cut, five projecting two rate cuts, and nine officials forecasting three rate cuts in 2024. Market analysts and economists will scrutinize the updated dot plot for shifts in these projections. A key area of focus will be whether officials who previously predicted three rate cuts have now moderated their expectations to one or two cuts. The consensus view among market participants will hinge on whether the dot plot signals a preference for one or two rate cuts by the end of the year, and if additional FOMC members have migrated to the no rate cut camp.\n\nThis FOMC meeting carries significant weight as it will shape market expectations regarding the Federal Reserve's monetary policy trajectory and the potential implications for the broader economy. Investors will closely monitor the dot plot and the accompanying statements for insights into the Fed's assessment of economic conditions and its plans for future rate adjustments.\n\nWhat are your views on the US Dollar - bullish or bearish??

Stocks jumped a snappy 1% on the news.\n\nConsumers should be cheered, too. One month's worth of economic numbers won't automatically ease the pressure on the family budget, but one important trend is convincingly going the right direction: Inflation in goods is finally getting back to normal.\n\nInflation came unleashed around this time three years ago, as vaccines helped end the COVID pandemic, cooped-up consumers started going out again, and trillions of dollars in stimulus money turbocharged spending. Since that coincided with Joe Biden's presidential term, many Americans blame Biden for eroding spending power. But it was mostly COVID-related factors that pushed goods prices up.\n\nThe pandemic triggered a huge shift in spending away from services toward goods since it was hard to travel or eat out but easy to order stuff online. Supply chain snafus also made some products scarce, and demand-supply imbalances sent prices soaring. In March of 2022, the one-year inflation rate for goods peaked at a whopping 14.2%.\n\nThe annual inflation rate for goods is now 0.1%. What matters most to consumers isn't the inflation number attached to any particular product; it's how much their paycheck buys. Here, the news is good too. During the last three years, the cost of all goods combined has risen by 14%. Earnings have risen by 14.9%. So goods are no longer taking an inordinately large bite out of the typical paycheck as they have been for much of the last two years.\n\nYes yes yes, some prices are still elevated, as the following chart shows. Food and energy are still up by more than earnings during the last three years. Those are staples that are hard to cut back on.\n\nBut other things have gone up in price by less than earnings, such as clothing, furniture, and appliances. The cost of electronics and toys actually declined during the last three years. People don't need to buy a new toaster or pair of shoes every month, but everybody needs to buy this kind of stuff sooner or later. Disinflation and deflation do help family budgets, even for non-staples.\n\nThere's more evidence that commodity prices should continue to moderate and, in some cases, decline. Gasoline prices, perhaps the best consumer proxy for overall inflation, have dropped since the government gathered the data on May inflation to a national average of around $3.45 per gallon.\n\nRetailers are cutting prices on thousands of items as shoppers get pickier and refuse to pony up for some things. Target (TGT),Walgreens(WBA), Ikea, Walmart (WMT),and other big chains have announced price cuts recently. McDonald's (MCD), Burger King, and KFC (YUM) have new bargain meal options. If the job market continues to soften, as many economists expect, that will cool demand even more and cement the return of goods inflation to normal levels.\n\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.\n\nAlas, inflation is not completely tamed. The overall inflation rate is now 3.3%, a huge improvement from the 9% peak in June 2022. But the Federal Reserve's target is 2%, and nobody complained during pre-COVID times when it was a bit lower than that.\n\nThe bogeyman is now services, in particular just a few service categories. Services inflation is 5.2%, still well above the Fed's target. During the last three years, the cost of all services combined rose by 18.3%, a bit more than incomes.\n\nRent is the big one, with rental inflation running 5.3% year over year. During the last three years, rents have risen 20.4%, 5.5 percentage points more than earnings. Since housing is most people's biggest expense, that has been a budget killer.\n\nRestaurant meals are up by 21% during the last three years, in part because a shortage of workers has pushed up wages, with the cost passed on to consumers. We didn't put auto insurance on the chart above because it would skew the scale, but those costs have soared by 47.1% since 2021, largely because fancier cars cost a lot more to fix and drivers are getting into more crashes.\n\nThe trend in services is also going the right way, however. The government's measure of rent prices doesn't take into account new leases, and many economists expect rent inflation to moderate during the coming months.\n\nThe Apartment List rental index, which does account for new leases, shows a modest decline in rents from the peak levels of 2022. The latest monthly report describes the rental market as \"sluggish,\" with \"seasonal declines steeper than usual and seasonal increases more mild.\" That means renters ought to have more leverage to negotiate cheaper rent when current leases expire.\n\nAs economists and politicians have learned, however, everybody has their own personal measure of inflation and rising prices can cause lasting consumer shell shock. Though the numbers show improvement, it could still be a while before Americans' estimation of the economy inflates.\n\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

I think there's definitely reasons to be excited. However, we've been excited for quite some time since November, really. In the S&P 500 (^GSPC), we rallied from 4,100 because of rate cuts right around the corner,\" Torres comments. \"At around 4,700, we started rallying because we didn't have rate cuts around the corner because earnings were strong.

But while the economy might be holding up just fine overall even with elevated borrowing costs, things are getting noticeably worse for those with lower incomes.\n\nThat's a troubling trend at any time, but particularly in an election year.\n\nPeople who max out their credit cards are increasingly having difficulty paying off their debt, according to a New York Fed report on the first quarter of the year. \"About a third of balances associated with maxed-out borrowers have gone delinquent in the last year, compared to less than a quarter of balances per year before the pandemic,\" researchers said in a recent blog post.\n\nAnd relief will be slow in coming. While new inflation data released this morning showed that prices were flat from April to May, prices are still up roughly 3 percent from a year ago -- and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will want to see more months of good data before letting up on the economy.\n\n\"Lower-income households felt the pain from the disease, which was higher inflation. And now they feel the pain from the cure, which is higher borrowing costs,\" said Beth Ann Bovino, chief economist at U.S. Bank.\n\nBovino said households on average spend about 10 percent of their income on debt payments -- but for lower-income people, it's more than 20 percent.\n\nThat's hardly the only area where they're feeling pinched. While overall price growth flatlined in May, shelter costs jumped 5.4 percent. Education and medical care costs also accelerated, although grocery prices have actually dropped modestly over the past few months.\n\nWealthier households, in contrast, are doing well, boosted by a buoyant stock market and higher yields on savings.\n\nThat spills over into how consumers view the political economy. Despite nearly three years of low unemployment and steady wage growth -- which dulls some of the pain of high debt costs -- Americans have given President Joe Biden low marks on his performance when it comes to the economy. Inflation and the economy's general health remain top priorities for many voters, and Biden's approval rating among those with household incomes of less than $75,000 stood at just 31 percent as of last month, according to Reuters.\n\nMarkets reacted to the May Consumer Price Index report by boosting the probability that the central bank could cut rates in September -- the rate-setting committee's last meeting before the presidential election in November. But the Fed might move more gradually. As Wells Fargo Investment Institute pointed out prior to Wednesday morning's release, investors have been overzealous in predicting rate cuts throughout the last year.\n\nAll of that means borrowing costs are likely to remain high for low-income consumers this year and into next, as the economy continues to be powered by those with more disposable income.\n\nThe wealthy are continuing to spend on services like travel and leisure, which has masked underlying weaknesses in other parts of the economy. Meanwhile, lower-income households are starting to tighten their belts. Wells Fargo Investment Institute President Darrell Cronk told reporters on a call Tuesday that this kind of bifurcation in consumer spending across income levels often occurs late in an economic cycle.\n\n\"It's like in 'Rocky.' Those high rates are body blows,\" the institute's senior global market strategist Sameer Samana said during the call. \"They don't show up as visibly as face shots,\" but they're just as damaging.\n\nHigh housing costs in particular have put a strain on lower-income and middle-class voters. Newer data suggests that rents have been cooling for months, but that can take a while to feed into official inflation numbers, since leases are often annual and data is collected from the same households every six months.\n\nHigher rates themselves are also making it more expensive for first-time homeowners to buy.\n\nBiden earlier this year proposed lowering housing costs by providing mortgage tax credits and eliminating title insurance on federally backed mortgages. But that can only help so much in a market where there simply isn't enough supply of homes -- a problem the administration has been also chipping at around the edges.\n\nThe contrasting effect that high rates have had on different income groups is clearly influencing how members of both parties have been tailoring their messaging. So far, neither one seems to have broken through.\n\nCertain Democrats like Sen. Elizabeth Warren -- ignoring the White House's piety when it comes to the Fed's independence -- are amplifying calls on the Fed's Powell to cut rates to preserve the labor market and boost investment in new housing. The Fed hasn't budged.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump in Las Vegas floated a plan this week to eliminate taxes on tipped income for service employees, making a direct play for a working-class voter bloc that serves as the backbone of Nevada's Democratic Party.\n\nThe powerful local culinary union was nonplussed.\n\n\"Some staffer somewhere did a good job suggesting to him that this would be a good way to split organized labor,\" said Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist and a top aide to former Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, adding: \"If past is prologue, the rank and file is never gonna go for it.\"\n\nWorkers' fortunes, in the meantime, are tied to the Fed's next steps. Powell has said that an unexpected weakening in the job market would push him to cut rates sooner; the central bank has mandates to pursue both price stability and maximum employment.\n\nBut he and his fellow policymakers are watching rising prices in labor-intensive services sectors, and Labor Department data last week showed wages were growing faster than expected, which could foreshadow further price increases.\n\nEssentially, the Fed hopes that wage growth will cool but price growth will cool more, such that people are ultimately better off.\n\n\"It's hard to tell somebody, 'I don't want to see wages climb higher,'\" Bovino said. \"We want to see wages in nominal terms soften, but real wages go up, because inflation is under control.\"", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve decided to keep rates unchanged at its meeting and revised lower interest rate cut expectations for 2024, tilting hawkish. The XAU/USD trades at $2,335, gains 0.81%.\n\nIn its monetary policy statement, the Fed mentioned they do \"not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\" They added that \"the Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.\"\n\nAside from this, the so-called 'dot-plot' showed that the median of the Fed officials upward revised their projections of the federal funds rate from 4.6% to 5.1%, toward the end of 2024. This means they are foreseen just one rate cut, compared to the current effective federal funds rate standing at 5.33%.\n\nFederal Reserve officials updated their economic projections for 2024. According to the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), they expect the economy to grow 2.1%, as foreseen in March, while the Unemployment Rate is estimated at 4%, unchanged from the previous SEP. PCE inflation is expected to edge higher from 2.4% to 2.6%, and Core PCE to rise from 2.6% to 2.8%.\n\nEarlier, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revealed that May's inflation in the US was unchanged compared to April's data, strengthening the golden metal as US Treasury bond yields plunged. The Greenback tumbled to a three-day low, as revealed by the US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the performance of the buck's value against a basket of six other currencies.\n\nThe US 10-year Treasury note yield edges down 14 basis points to 4.266%, a tailwind for the yellow metal. Consequently, the DXY plummeted 0.83% to 104.38.\n\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the latest US inflation report increased the odds of a Fed rate cut in September from 46.7% to 61.3%.\n\nGold remains neutral to downwardly biased after forming a Head-and-Shoulders chart pattern. Although it hints that the non-yielding metal could be headed to the downside, the Fed's decision could negate the chart pattern if XAU/USD climbs past the June 7 cycle high of $2.387, opening the door to test the $2,400 mark.\n\nConversely, if XAU/USD drops below the $2,300 figure, the next demand area would be the May 3 low of $2,277, followed by the March 21 high of $2,222. Further losses lie beneath, as sellers would eye the Head-and-Shoulders chart pattern objective at around $2170 to $2160.", "source": {"uri": "fxstreet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FXStreet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Treasury security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Dollar_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Dollar Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Commodities/Metals/Gold/stacked-gold-bars-13094022_Large.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640462", "eventUri": "eng-9640462", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 2509, "textEnd": 2515}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 2669, "textEnd": 2674}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-21", "textStart": 2706, "textEnd": 2714}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 105, "relevance": 1}

Stanley Australia Summit, Sydney", "body": "Thanks Tim for the introduction; to you and Richard and your team at Morgan Stanley in Australia; and to your colleagues here from around the world.\n\nCan I just say how grateful I am for the opportunity to speak to such a big and well\u2011informed crowd on Gadigal country today.\n\nI acknowledge elders, customs and custodians and I thank you all for being here.\n\nIt's been one month since the Budget, and one week since the latest National Accounts release gave us a good sense of how our economy was faring in the first 3 months of this year.\n\nGrowth has been weak, quarterly inflation has been moderating but it's still higher than we'd like, and the geopolitical situation has created an even more complex set of global influences.\n\nThese are the conditions we anticipated in the Budget, so they came as no surprise.\n\nWe saw them then and see them now as a very clear justification for our balanced approach to fighting inflation without smashing the economy.\n\nThat's why our fiscal strategy combines relief for people doing it tough, repair of the budget, and reform of our economy.\n\nI want to get us to questions on time, so I'm going to limit my contribution to 5 areas which illustrates these key goals and what we've tried to achieve in our Budget and broader plan.\n\nFirst, to fight inflation in a way that doesn't damage an already weak economy.\n\nSecond, to repair the budget to help insulate ourselves against uncertainty, pay down debt, and make room for our priorities, including our longer\u2011term growth agenda.\n\nThird, balancing our near and long\u2011term objectives, delivering cost\u2011of\u2011living relief that puts downward pressure on inflation, as we invest in renewable energy, human capital and the industries which will power a Future Made in Australia.\n\nFourth, making our economy more productive, more competitive and more dynamic.\n\nAnd finally, making our people beneficiaries not victims of all the churn and change happening in the global economy.\n\nI'll start by taking stock of the economic conditions we face and how they shaped our decisions in the Budget.\n\nAs you know, the global economic environment is complex and fragile.\n\nModerating but lingering global inflation, higher interest rates, fragmenting supply chains and conflicts in Europe and the Middle East are creating significant uncertainty.\n\nThe US is doing well but other economies are feeling the lagged impact of monetary policy tightening.\n\nAlmost three-quarters of the OECD have recorded a negative quarter over the past year.\n\nGlobal factors were playing out in last week's Australian National Accounts for March as well.\n\nThe Treasury forecasts in the Budget anticipated weak growth in our economy primarily because of higher interest rates, moderating but high inflation and global economic uncertainty - and that's what we saw.\n\nPerhaps the biggest part of that story is weak consumption growth, hammered by higher interest rates.\n\nThe Budget forecast consumption to grow by only \u00bc per cent this year - when it usually grows around 2 \u00bd per cent.\n\nWe saw this weakness play out in the National Accounts, with consumption growing below average for the last 5 quarters.\n\nAt the same time, people are saving less, with the household savings ratio falling to rates not seen in around 15 years.\n\nThe pressures on people are also clear in the shifting composition of consumption.\n\nAs you can see in the chart, not only has consumption growth slowed but it is now dominated by essential spending.\n\nSince the end of 2022, discretionary consumption has gone backwards, meaning any remaining consumption has been driven by essentials.\n\nThat's why the primary focus of the Budget was to tackle inflation and provide meaningful but responsible cost\u2011of\u2011living relief in the form of tax cuts, energy bill relief, cheaper medicines and help with rent and student debt.\n\nAnd build on our strengths, namely moderating inflation, real wages growth, historically low unemployment, record high participation and stronger public finances.\n\nAs you can see in the chart, inflation has moderated substantially off its 2022 peaks and Treasury now forecasts it will return to the RBA's target band sooner, perhaps by the end of the year.\n\nObviously, the outlook is uncertain and the Budget is not the only influence, but fiscal policy can assist in the fight against inflation.\n\nWe are already helping, but it's important to understand the impact of the May Budget won't show up in key economic data until the second half of the year.\n\nOur cost\u2011of\u2011living relief across 2 budgets is expected to reduce inflation by \u00be of a percentage point this year and by \u00bd of a percentage point next year.\n\nWe'll learn more about our labour market in tomorrow's data but the 820,000 jobs created since we were elected is already a record for a first term government, and we have seen stronger jobs growth than any major advanced economy.\n\nWages are growing at rates not seen for 15 years, real wages are now growing again, and the combination of a resilient labour market, wage growth and tax cuts will support real income growth in the coming year.\n\nThis should help underpin consumption and a broader recovery.\n\nThis is what a soft landing on a narrow runway looks like:\n\nAn economy still growing, inflation coming back to band, unemployment with a 4 in front of it, tax cuts and rising wages supporting a gradual recovery in consumption, and a sensible approach to budget repair to buffer us against uncertainty.\n\nThis is the soft landing we are cautiously confident of, but not complacent about.\n\nJust as a soft landing in the global economy is assumed, but not yet assured.\n\nWe only need to look abroad to see how difficult this is to achieve.\n\nThe task of taming inflation has halted growth in Europe, raised unemployment in Canada to its highest level in 2 years, and progress on inflation has slowed in the US - but we'll get an update on that tonight.\n\nAchieving a soft landing in this complicated environment is a focus of our Budget, and it shaped our fiscal strategy.\n\nOur responsible economic management is carefully calibrated for the combination of challenges that we confront.\n\nWith growth in the March quarter at only 0.1 per cent, and 1.1 per cent through the year, it is clear how misguided the hawkish pre\u2011Budget commentary was.\n\nIn this environment it would be irresponsible to slash and burn and cut too much.\n\nOur more balanced approach is tackling inflation without crunching the economy.\n\nOur approach has seen a substantial improvement in the budget position.\n\nWe are delivering a history\u2011making consolidation - and not at the expense of the economy.\n\nWe have turned 2 big deficits into 2 substantial surpluses.\n\nYou can see this in the chart.\n\nAnd the RBA Governor last week confirmed this is helping in the inflation fight.\n\nThe budget is already cumulatively $215 billion better than we inherited.\n\nWe've found $77.4 billion in savings and re\u2011prioritisations and debt to GDP is expected to peak almost 10 percentage points below what was forecast when we came to office.\n\nThis means less debt and lower interest payments.\n\nOur fiscal turnaround is already the biggest and fastest in the G20, and our fiscal balance is the second\u2011best as a share of GDP.\n\nThe budget improvement we delivered in our first year of office is a record for any first term Australian Government.\n\nOur 2.3 percentage point turnaround was more than double the Howard government's 1 percentage point, and better than the first year of any government of either political persuasion.\n\nDelivering a substantial consolidation at the same time as we support people doing it tough and make key investments in the foundations of future growth.\n\nThis is how we balance our near and longer term objectives.\n\nIn the near term that means fighting inflation and delivering cost\u2011of\u2011living relief, but also investing in housing and infrastructure and managing migration.\n\nWe're seeking to build 1.2 million new homes by 2029.\n\nWe've backed this in with $6 billion in new investment in the Budget, taking it to $32 billion in new money under this government, to build more homes, slash red tape and train more construction workers.\n\nWe are delivering our $120 billion infrastructure pipeline in a measured and coordinated way that gets us value for money and doesn't add to inflation.\n\nAnd we're managing the migration system in an orderly, responsible, methodical way, getting it back down to normal levels.\n\nLonger term, we have an ambitious investment agenda to get more capital flowing into our economy.\n\nThe world is changing, and the speed of that change is accelerating as we move towards net zero by 2050.\n\nAs the PM said on Friday, this transition will demand the biggest transformation in the global economy since the industrial revolution.\n\nOur Future Made in Australia agenda will help make us an indispensable part of the global economy, by attracting not replacing private investment in key industries and making our country a renewable energy superpower.\n\nTo realise this ambition, we need much more private capital, flowing much more efficiently in our economy.\n\nThat's why we're creating a front door for investors to accelerate and coordinate transformational projects and establishing a domestic National Interest Account, that adds discipline to investments in the national interest.\n\nThe global energy transformation represents a golden opportunity.\n\nAustralia needs an additional $225 billion of investment by 2050 to transition the energy system and realise net zero opportunities in heavy industries.\n\nThat's why we're investing $13.7 billion in production tax incentives for green hydrogen and processed critical minerals and $1.7 billion for an Innovation Fund, to develop new industries like green metals and low carbon fuels.\n\nThe financial services industry will play a central role in all of this, especially in the way that private capital is attracted and deployed.\n\nTo best utilise this investment we need to make our economy more productive, dynamic and competitive.\n\nAs we leverage the structural changes in the global economy and recognise the growing importance of services and the care economy.\n\nThis is a significant part of a broader reform agenda that aligns the interests of the government with all of you here, but which gets insufficient attention.\n\nIn the last few months we've made some significant announcements when it comes to competition policy.\n\nWe're making the biggest reforms to our merger regime in 50 years to create a faster, stronger, simpler, more targeted and more transparent system.\n\nFrom 1 July 2024, we will abolish almost 500 nuisance tariffs, streamlining $8.5 billion in annual trade.\n\nWe're strengthening and streamlining the foreign investment framework.\n\nLast year our government and all states and territories agreed to revitalise National Competition Policy - with Treasurers to agree new competition principles by the end of the year.\n\nWe're boosting competition in the financial system by modernising payments and supporting more participants to offer clearing and settlement services.\n\nAnd through our financial sector regulatory initiatives grid to make it simpler for smaller banks to comply and compete.\n\nOur competition policies are just one part of our broader productivity agenda we outlined last year and significantly advanced in the Budget.\n\nOur productivity agenda has 5 key pillars.\n\nOne, creating a more dynamic and resilient economy, through a Future Made in Australia, our competition reforms and our regulatory reform agenda.\n\nTwo, building a skilled and adaptable workforce through investments in skills and the University Accord reforms, and tax reforms that will boost labour supply by almost one million hours per week.\n\nThree, harnessing data and the digital economy, by investing in the world's first commercial grade quantum computer, our AI strategy and expanding the Digital ID.\n\nFour, investing in cheaper and cleaner energy and the net zero transformation through our Future Made in Australia plan, funding the capacity investment scheme and reforms to investment vehicles like the Net Zero Economy Authority.\n\nAnd five, as our population ages and the care economy expands, delivering quality care more efficiently.\n\nBy reforming the NDIS to ensure its sustainability, reforming aged care and investing in home care, so Australians can choose the care that best suits them.\n\nTogether, this agenda constitutes more significant reform in 2 years, than our predecessors managed in the decade before.\n\nSo in all of these areas:\n\nA budget that fights inflation, while investing in future growth and strengthening our fiscal buffers.\n\nA growing economy with moderating inflation and solid job creation.\n\nAnd a reform and investment agenda that not only attracts capital but better deploys it in a more productive, more competitive and more dynamic economy.\n\nYou can see our plan to successfully navigate the economic upheaval and the uncertainty we face.\n\nSo that our people, our businesses and investors become the primary beneficiaries of a changing and churning global economy.\n\nIn a way that makes us confident but not complacent of a soft landing on a narrow runway.", "source":

However, the sustainability of these gains and potential for further upside hinges largely on two key events: the upcoming inflation report due before the market opens and the Federal Reserve's June rate decision, along with commentary regarding the near-term interest rate trajectory. Investors will be hanging on to every word from Fed Chair Jerome Powell when he hosts the post-meeting press conference shortly after the rate decision.\n\nPositive sentiment generated by Oracle Corp.'s (NYSE:ORCL) earnings may also provide support for tech stocks. While bond yields remained subdued, commodities prices firmed up.\n\nStocks closed Tuesday's session on a mixed note as tech strength mitigated jitters about the Fed's rate decision. Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) led the tech charge, in apparently a late reaction to its Worldwide Developers Conference keynote. The Nasdaq Composite spent the better part of the session in positive territory before ending moderately higher, while the S&P 500 Index languished in the red before making a comeback in late trading.\n\nBoth the averages hit intraday and closing records.\n\nOn the other hand, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the small-cap-focused Russell 2,000 Index had a weak outing on Tuesday.\n\nCommenting on the market move, fund manager Louis Navellier said, \"Tech has become the safe ground for growth, and the early beneficiaries of the ongoing AI rollout.\"\n\nInsights From Analysts:\n\nAhead of the Fed decision, Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, said, \"Market participants believe the Fed is committed to conquering inflation, which partially explains the range-bound yield on the 10-year treasury.\" The Fed's job is made tougher because of the less interest-rate sensitive economy, he said.\n\n\"Inflation is cooling and the Fed should be in a position to begin their rate-cutting cycle this year, although the magnitude and speed of cuts will continue to frustrate investors,\" the economist said.\n\nUpcoming Economic Data:\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release its May consumer price inflation report at 8:30 a.m. EDT. The key numbers to watch for are:\n\nThe Fed will announce its interest rate verdict at 2 p.m. EDT via the post-meeting policy statement. The central bank will also release the Summary of Economic Projections, which comprises the all-import dot-plot chart -- a projection of rate expectations of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nFed Chair Powell will host a press conference at 2:30 p.m. EDT to explain the rate decision and offer commentary on the rate outlook.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury will release its monthly budget statement for May at 2 p.m. EDT.\n\nStocks In Focus:\n\nCrude oil and gold futures rose ahead of the Fed decision, potentially factoring in a dovish tone from the Fed. The yield on the 10-year note remained unchanged at 4.402%.\n\nBitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) climbed more than a percent and was striving to break above the $68K level.\n\nMost Asian markets retreated as traders moved to the sidelines ahead of the U.S. Fed decision, although the Chinese, South Korean, Taiwanese, and Indian markets gained ground. The European market recovered from a three-session sell-off.\n\nRead Next: JPMorgan's Top Strategist Sticks To Bearish S&P 500 Forecast, Warns Of 2008-Like Crash: 'Equities Continue To Price In Little

Since the Governing Council meeting in September 2023, inflation has fallen by more than 2.5 percentage points and the inflation outlook has improved markedly.\n\nUnderlying inflation has also eased, reinforcing the signs that price pressures have weakened, and inflation expectations have declined at all horizons. Monetary policy has kept financing conditions restrictive. By dampening demand and keeping inflation expectations well anchored, this has made a major contribution to bringing inflation back down.\n\nAt the same time, despite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year. The latest Eurosystem staff projections for both headline and core inflation have been revised up for 2024 and 2025 compared with the March projections. Staff now see headline inflation averaging 2.5% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. For inflation excluding energy and food, staff project an average of 2.8% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025 and 2.0% in 2026. Economic growth is expected to pick up to 0.9% in 2024, 1.4% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026.\n\nThe Governing Council is determined to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. It will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim. The council will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, its interest rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path.\n\nThe council notes that the asset purchase programme portfolio is declining at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem no longer reinvests the principal payments from maturing securities. On the pandemic emergency purchase programme, the council intends to continue to reinvest, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until the end of June 2024.\n\nOver the second half of the year, it intends to reduce the PEPP portfolio by \u20ac7.5 billion per month on average. The council intends to discontinue reinvestments under the PEPP at the end of 2024. The council will continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.\n\nAs banks are repaying the amounts borrowed under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, the council will regularly assess how targeted lending operations and their ongoing repayment are contributing to its monetary policy stance.\n\nThe council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% target over the medium term and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission.\n\nMoreover, the Transmission Protection Instrument is available to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across all euro area countries, thus allowing the council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate.\n\nOn June 3, the ECB announced the seven-day MRO. The operation was conducted on June 4 and attracted bids from euro area eligible counterparties of \u20ac2,327 million, \u20ac2,575 million less than the previous week. The amount was allotted in full at a fixed rate equivalent to the prevailing MRO rate of 4.50%, in accordance with current ECB policy.\n\nOn June 5, the ECB conducted a seven-day US dollar funding operation through collateralised lending in conjunction with the US Federal Reserve. This operation attracted bids of $114.10 million, which were allotted in full at a fixed rate of 5.58%.\n\nIn the domestic primary market for Treasury bills, the Treasury invited tenders for 91-day and 182-day bills for settlement value June 6, maturing on September 5 and December 5, respectively.\n\nBids of \u20ac81.62 million were submitted for the 91-day bills, with the Treasury accepting \u20ac25.37 million, while bids of \u20ac34.75 million were submitted for the 182-day bills, with the Treasury accepting \u20ac4.11 million. Since \u20ac55.02 million worth of bills matured during the week, the outstanding balance of Treasury bills decreased by \u20ac25.54 million, standing at \u20ac547.69 million.\n\nThe yield from the 91-day bill auction was 3.558%, increasing by 0.30 basis point from bids with a similar tenor issued on May 30, representing a bid price of \u20ac99.1086 per \u20ac100 nominal. The yield from the 182-day bill auction was 2.998%, decreasing by 8.30 basis points from bids with a similar tenor also issued on May 30, representing a bid price of \u20ac98.5070 per \u20ac100 nominal.\n\nDuring this week, secondary market turnover in Malta Government Treasury bills amounted to \u20ac350,000, all executed on the On-exchange market of the Malta Stock Exchange.\n\nToday, June 11, the Treasury will invite tenders for 91-day and 182-day bills maturing on September 12 and December 12, respectively.", "source": {"uri": "timesofmalta.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Wholly contrary to popular belief, he assures us, \"Inflation Is Not Destroying Joe Biden.\" So why can't the rest of America see it? 'Tis a mystery to be solved, and he buries us under \"data\" to make his point. Ultimately, his piece is a primal scream of horror that Americans insist on believing the realities of their wallets over the cherry-picked data in his analysis.\n\nFirst, Carter first declares that inflation os a thing of the past. \"According to the Federal Reserve's preferred measure, prices rose just 2.7 percent between April of 2023 and April of 2024.\"\n\nThe problem with the Fed is that its \"core\" inflation number excludes the cost of food, housing, and energy - the things that average Americans spend the vast majority of their income purchasing. When those numbers are added in, things change:\n\nJason De Sena Trennert of Strategas Research Partners constructed a Common Man Inflation index of items that people must buy regularly -- food, energy, shelter, clothing, utilities and insurance. Nothing discretionary is included. In April, Common Man CPI grew at 3.8% year on year, higher than headline CPI for the ninth consecutive month. Common Man CPI so defined has topped headline inflation in 34 of the 40 months of the Biden administration to date.\n\nSecond, inflation is cumulative. Prices that rose with Biden's double digit inflation are now baked into the cake and don't decline merely because inflation slows month to month:\n\nThird, Carter sees inflation in primary consumer goods as unimportant because other presidents, despite similar inflationary price rises, were seen as far better on the economy than Biden. For instance, he points to Ronald Reagan. Prices rose 17% during his first three years in office.\n\nWhat Carter ignores about Reagan's economy is that real wealth was expanding as the economy expanded. Thanks to economic expansion, tax cuts, and job growth, the net worth of families earning between $20,000 and $50,000 increased by 27%, far exceeding inflation. None of that is happening under Biden. Indeed, it is the opposite.\n\nThe WSJ recently compared the Trump and Biden presidencies on the stock market and household wealth to measure the economy's health. The two administrations were roughly equal in market performance but they were as different as night and day when it came to household wealth.\n\nThus, with no adjustment for inflation, Biden has \"overseen a 19 percent increase in total household net worth compared to the 23 percent growth experienced in the first three years of the Trump administration.\" However, once you factor in inflation, though, and all of Biden's gains prove illusory:\n\nAfter several other similarly misguided arguments, Carter finally settled on one possible cause of discontent: increased housing costs.\n\nMy best guess is that housing is a significant part of it. Housing has been unusually expensive since the pandemic due to two mass moving events -- city people running to the country, then running back to the city.\n\nHowever, it appears that Carter does not believe that either inflation or uncontrolled illegal immigration (which wreaks havoc with housing in minority communities) plays any role in housing costs.

Is this cost-push inflation or demand-pull inflation? Typically cost-push inflation is where you start getting worried about wage-price spirals. I don't think this is what we experienced in the U.S. I think we very much experienced demand-pull inflation where demand is so strong and firms are able to pass on price cost increases as well as maintaining a healthy profit margin. Wage pressures also increased. And what drove the acceleration in wages, I think, was the fact that we had a lot of vacancies per unemployed workers. We had two job postings for every unemployed worker. And what we also know is that workers that switch jobs get higher wage increases. So, in an economy with many vacancies, with many workers moving to higher-paid jobs, we also saw an acceleration in wage pressures. As vacancies have come down and labour market churn has slowed, we are also seeing wage inflation come down. And this is happening even as the unemployment rate hasn't increased. So this makes me think that this is demand-pull inflation, not a wage-price spiral.\n\nConfusing market readings\n\nBU: We are grappling right now with why the U.S. economy and demand in general was so strong in the second half of last year, and why the economy is not slowing down as much as one would have expected even if interest rates have increased to 5.5%. I think, there is a big debate whether this is because the economy is less interest-rate sensitive. For example, a lot of consumer and corporate debt has been locked in at lower interest rates. So that means we're not feeling the pain from higher interest rates. Or whether there has been a dynamic shift in the U.S. economy, where the equilibrium interest rate -- or the neutral interest rate -- is higher than we thought. And what that means is that perhaps potential growth and productivity and labour supply in the U.S. might be increasing in a way that means central banks will have to keep interest rates higher for longer.\n\nAnd finally, what's the takeaway for wealth professionals?\n\nBU: Let's not just focus on the consensus narrative. Because oftentimes we'll have outsized positive or negative returns when we miss the consensus narrative. So let's position our portfolios in a way that we have hedges if inflation were to remain higher for longer. And those short-dated credit assets would perform well in this world, as well as inflation-linked bonds that hedge investors toward higher inflation.

Is there any worry for you that we're headed towards even a mild form of stagflation, 70s style?\n\nCHALMERS:\n\nThat's not our expectation and we do have a remarkably resilient labour market still and that's one of the big differences here. We'll learn more about our labour market tomorrow when we get our labour force data. We have had slower growth but we've had inflation moderating to almost half what it was 2 years ago, more than half what it was - less than half what it was at its peak. So, we've got moderating inflation, we've got a resilient labour market, we've got relatively weak growth and in all of these circumstances, it was really important in our Budget that we carefully calibrated our fiscal settings to respond to those economic conditions and those economic challenges. And I'm confident, but not complacent, that we can achieve a soft landing here in Australia on that narrow runway that our Reserve Bank Governor has described.\n\nSTROUD\u2011WATTS:\n\nAnd the energy rebates obviously were a core part of your Budget recently. Do you expect that's going to give the room for the RBA to start cutting?\n\nCHALMERS:\n\nWell, it remains to be seen and I try not to predict or pre\u2011empt decisions taken by our independent central bank. My job is to focus on the fight against inflation, we've made welcome and encouraging progress on that front but as we're seeing around the world, inflation doesn't always moderate in a perfectly straight line, it zigs and zags, we're seeing that in the US and elsewhere. And so overall, inflation has moderated considerably, but we need it to moderate further and faster. Our Budget will help play a role in that by the way we've designed our cost\u2011of\u2011living help to take the pressure off inflation and also the responsible way that we're managing the budget. The bottom lines in our Budget are substantially stronger than they were a couple of years ago and that's important too.\n\nSTROUD\u2011WATTS:\n\nYou just referenced the zigs and zags that we've seen. When it comes to kind of the structural uncertainty that have been paid out for inflation, how fine is the balance of risks for policymaking?\n\nCHALMERS:\n\nOh, there is a balance that needs to be struck responding to these risks in the economy. As you said before rightly, we've had slowing growth. Consumption is especially weak when it comes to discretionary spending. Our labour market is a little bit softer, but still remarkably resilient. So, we need to balance all of these considerations, all of these factors and influences including global influences, China and the US and around the world and in doing that, what we're trying to do and what I'm confident we are doing is we are fighting inflation without smashing our economy. We're achieving that balance pretty effectively so far, but there are no shortage of challenges in the economy, global and domestic, and we're cognisant of those too.\n\nSTROUD\u2011WATTS:\n\nIs it a risky time to be running a procyclical campaign policy at this point? Does that make it sort of harder potentially, if there is a risk of a downturn?\n\nCHALMERS:\n\nI don't see it the way that you've described it and our Reserve Bank Governor was before the Parliament last week and said the fact that we had turned 2 very big deficits into 2 substantial surpluses was helping in the fight against inflation. We've made really quite substantial progress, historic progress in Budget repair and that's helping in the fight against inflation and our overall approach which has been responsible, the way we've designed our cost\u2011of\u2011living help, our budget is taking the edge off inflation rather than adding to it. The Budget is not the only influence, obviously, on our monetary policy, on our interest rate settings, or indeed on our trajectory of inflation but it does have a role to play, and we are doing our bit.\n\nSTROUD\u2011WATTS:\n\nDo you think this is a time where we need to see more revenue raising by Australia? Would you see at some point a broadening of the tax base, for example?\n\nCHALMERS:\n\nI think in any budget you need to do a combination of things. You need to make sure the revenue base is sustainable and we've done a number of things over the first 3 budgets of our government to make the tax base more sustainable, to pay for aged care and disability care and pay for the debt, the interest on our debt, pay for defence and healthcare, these big pressures, structural pressures in our Budget. We are making our tax system more sustainable to help pay for that but we're also finding savings in our Budget, almost $80 billion in savings. We're also banking the majority of the upward revisions to revenue to make sure we're getting the budget into much better condition and all of that together helps to make room to fund our priorities, to pay down debt and also to buffer ourselves against some of this global uncertainty that we're seeing.\n\nSTROUD\u2011WATTS:\n\nAnd on the monetary side. Are you happy with Michelle Bullock and the job that she's doing? It's been about 9 months now since she's taken the helm.\n\nCHALMERS:\n\nI'm obviously very proud of the appointment that we made of Governor Bullock. I think people are seeing some of the reasons why we're proud of that appointment. The clear speaking, the communication has been an important part of that but it's not really for me to kind of engage in an ongoing performance review of Governor Bullock or any other governor in our system - the governor does her job independently. The Reserve Bank board takes decisions independently from the government. But we are doing our bit in all of the ways that you and I have talked about today.\n\nSTROUD\u2011WATTS:\n\nIt's going to be a busy weekend with the Chinese Premier's visit. What are the economic stakes for Australia?\n\nCHALMERS:\n\nObviously, this is an incredibly important economic relationship for Australia and Premier Li's visit will be a really welcome opportunity for us to continue to engage, to continue to stabilise a relationship which has no shortage of challenges and complexities. It can be a complex relationship to manage but what we've shown, I think, in the last 2 years is that by engaging, by standing up for our interests when it's necessary to do so, but also looking for ways to engage and stabilise the relationship, there can be good economic dividends from that. We're very pleased to see almost all of the trade restrictions lifted over the past couple of years - that's important for our employers and our industries and our exporters. We recognise and understand how important that economic relationship is and Premier Li's visit will be an opportunity to advance that even further.\n\nSTROUD\u2011WATTS:\n\nWe were talking about the inflation numbers for China and obviously for Australia. We're closely watching the developments when it comes to the economic recovery, we hope is an economic recovery. Do you think the recovery is on foot? Do you think the property sector is at least out of structural levels of direness that we've seen? And do you think that translates to still a longer\u2011term demand for Australian commodities?\n\nCHALMERS:\n\nWe've acknowledged and understood and felt some of the weakness in the Chinese economy in recent times, recent quarters and that won't fix itself overnight. Even with some of the interventions by the authorities, we're still seeing some underlying weakness in the Chinese economy, and that does impact on our commodity prices and on our economy more broadly, so we watch that very closely. The thing about the global economy, it's a mixed bag - China has been a bit weaker, the American economy has been a bit stronger, Canada's got higher unemployment, Europe has seen almost no growth, and so all together, this is a difficult global environment to navigate. And again, it's why it's so important we engage with our trading partners, we get the budget in better nick to buffer ourselves against this global uncertainty, we fight inflation without smashing growth. All of these conditions we're seeing around the world and around our country justify the approach that we've taken in our Budget.\n\nSTROUD\u2011WATTS:\n\nThere's been quite a bit of interest around Northern Minerals and the shareholders thereof. How do you engage with China when it comes to strategic minerals given that we know that the Premier is likely to visit a lithium refinery in WA?\n\nCHALMERS:\n\nWe've been very upfront about our interests here and where we need to advance our interests, we'll do so. Whether it's in the Foreign Investment Review Board process or in other ways, we see critical minerals really as the opportunity of a century for Australia. There's a lot of interest from around the world, not just from China, in our critical minerals, and that's because they are such a crucial part of the future economy. And so my job in addition to engaging with the Chinese, in addition to making sure that our Foreign Investment regime is robust and implemented properly, is to make sure we make the most of this critical minerals opportunity. We want to make Australia an indispensable part of the global shift to net zero, this big energy transformation that's happening around the world and critical minerals are an important part of that.\n\nSTROUD\u2011WATTS:\n\nChina could make or break that, though. If you take a look at the Indonesian nickel impact on Australia's nickel boom, you can't beat them. Do you join them? Do you work together with Beijing?\n\nCHALMERS:\n\nObviously there have been some concerning developments in the global nickel market, and we've been upfront about that as well. We engage with our own exporters and employers, businesses substantially on that question. We want to make sure that these global markets for critical resources are operating efficiently and we want to make sure that Australia is a successful part of that.\n\nSTROUD\u2011WATTS:\n\nClearly, the antenna is up there when it comes to foreign interest in strategic areas of investment, is this something that's going to be a key focus do you think going forward?\n\nCHALMERS:\n\nWell, when we announced our changes to the Foreign Investment Review Board process, the regime, we made it very clear that in some areas we'll be strengthening the regime, in other areas, we'll be streamlining the regime, whether it's critical infrastructure or critical minerals or critical technology. Obviously, like any country, we'll be looking to strengthen that regime to make sure that any investment in those critical areas is in our national economic interest.\n\nSTROUD\u2011WATTS:\n\nThere's already been a number of overtures in the setup to the [INAUDIBLE] visit in terms of reducing the tariffs and sort of smoothing out that relationship. Do you think that relationship is on a steadier footing? What are you hoping to take away from the visit?\n\nCHALMERS:\n\nCertainly the relationship is on a steadier footing but we are not naive or unrealistic about the challenges of managing what is a complex relationship in our region and we've been upfront about that as well. Our job is to engage, to do that in a meaningful and respectful way, to speak up for and stand up for our national interests when that's necessary, but overwhelmingly to manage that relationship in the interests of our people and our economy and I think we have made some good progress there, and we see Premier Li's visit as an opportunity to advance that progress even further.\n\nSTROUD\u2011WATTS:\n\nYou've also said that Australia will be fine in the case of another Trump presidency. But, you know, history tells us that left\u2011leaning governments tend to fare not that well under Trump in terms of a global context. Are you wargaming for what might happen, obviously, with respect to what would happen with America's policies towards China, Australia is a vulnerable proxy there, too.\n\nCHALMERS:\n\nWell, a couple of things about that. Obviously, we follow the political developments in the United States very closely, as everyone does around the world but we are confident that the relationship will be strong no matter who the Americans choose to lead them. We play the cards that we're dealt when it comes to decisions taken by democracies around the world and we will engage enthusiastically with our American friends no matter what the outcome of the election is and I think what we showed when President Trump was president last time is that Australia has an important role to play in that relationship. When it comes to the description that you applied to our government, I see our government as a real centrist, middle\u2011of\u2011the\u2011road government, taking decisions in our national economic interest, not overloading on ideology in either direction and I think that is a useful way to think of us and certainly that's the way that we engage with friends around the world.\n\nSTROUD\u2011WATTS:\n\nTreasurer, it's a pleasure having you with us. We appreciate your time.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name":

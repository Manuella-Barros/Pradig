Cory Booker plans to introduce a bill to remove statues from the US Capitol honoring Confederate soldiers despite President Donald Trump calling these memorials \"beautiful.\"\n\n\"I will be introducing a bill to remove Confederate statues from the US Capitol building. This is just one step. We have much work to do,\" the New Jersey Democrat tweeted Wednesday.\n\nThere are at least 10 Confederate statues in the Capitol, distributed between the Hall of Columns, the Capitol Visitor Center and other locations, most notably Statuary Hall, where each state chooses two statues to be on display.\n\nBooker said in a statement to CNN that having to see Confederate statues in a position of honor in a place as public as the Capitol can be \"painful.\"\n\n\"The Capitol is a place for all Americans to come and feel welcomed, encouraged, and inspired,\" he said. \"Confederate statues do the opposite.\"\n\n\"They are, unequivocally, not only statues of treasonous Americans, but are symbolic to some who seek to revise history and advance hate and division,\" the lawmaker added. \"To millions of Americans, they are painful, injurious symbols of bigotry and hate, celebrating individuals who sought to break our nation asunder and preserve the vile institution of slavery and white supremacy.\"\n\nWhen asked about the inclusion of Confederate statues in the Capitol, Doug Andres, a spokesman for House Speaker Paul Ryan said \"These are decisions for those states to make.\" CNN has also reached out to the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and has not yet received a response.\n\nBooker's communications director said that the senator will introduce the bill after Labor Day, as the Senate is currently on recess.\n\nSen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, told a local radio station that what statues are included in the Capitol should face more discussion but did not endorse a plan that removes Confederate statues.\n\n\"I know Cory Booker, one of the Senators I work with, is trying to say, at the federal level, we ought to have the same process, where we look at monuments that have federal jurisdiction, and I'm talking to him about how we might move forward on that. So this is a conversation that is going to, I think, go on now for some time, but I think that everybody needs to have a chance to be heard,\" Warner told WRVA radio on Thursday.\n\nBooker is getting support from Democrats in the House, including from Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who said in a statement, \"The Confederate statues in the halls of Congress have always been reprehensible.\"\n\n\"If Republicans are serious about rejecting white supremacy, I call upon Speaker Ryan to join Democrats to remove the Confederate statues from the Capitol immediately,\" she added.\n\nRELATED: Trump calls removal of Confederate monuments 'so foolish'\n\nAs a growing number of American cities work to remove statues commemorating the Confederacy, Trump defended the statues again Thursday, arguing that removing them uproots American \"culture\" and history.\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he said in a series of tweets. \"You ... can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also ... the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\" he tweeted.\n\nActivists expressed interest and support for removing statues honoring Confederate soldiers and the Mississippi state flag, which includes a Confederate symbol, after the June 2015 massacre in Charleston, South Carolina, where Dylann Roof, a white supremacist who was photographed with Confederate memorabilia, killed nine black Americans during a church prayer service.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley signed a bill in July 2015 to bring down the Confederate flag on the statehouse grounds, less than a day after lawmakers in the state House of Representatives voted to remove it.\n\nCentered in the Deep South but stretching from California to Massachusetts, roughly 1,500 Confederate symbols still exist on public land more than 150 years after the conclusion of the Civil War, according to 2016 data from the Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama-based advocacy nonprofit organization that tracks civil rights and hate crimes in the United States.\n\nRoughly half of those symbols -- 718 of them as of last year -- are monuments and statues. Three in four of them were built before 1950, but at least one in 10 of them were dedicated during the civil rights movement or since the year 2000.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri":

Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. said it was important to work toward the goal of Booker's legislation, but he also sought to keep the attention on Trump's comments about what occurred in Charlottesville.\n\n\"We must continue to denounce and resist President Trump for his reprehensible actions,\" Schumer tweeted.\n\nSimilarly, an aide to Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said the senator supports Booker's proposal, but he is focused on other issues as well.\n\nA spokeswoman for Kaine, Sarah Peck, said the senator \"also believes the Senate needs to work to combat hate crimes and address the fundamental inequities in our society that have left African-Americans and families of color in this country with far less wealth, higher unemployment rates, fewer opportunities and less protection under the law.\"\n\nDemocratic lawmakers are also calling for Congress to focus more attention on the threat of domestic terrorism. The House Homeland Security Committee will hold a hearing on Sept. 12, with the panel's chairman urging lawmakers to question witnesses on the dangers posed by domestic terrorists and other extremist groups. But Democrats complained that the hearing was part of an annual review that had already been scheduled before the Charlottesville events. They wanted more time to go into detail to address the threat from white supremacists and neo-Nazi groups.\n\n\"After years of requests for congressional hearings and the deaths of many, this is nothing more than attempt to distract from a topic the Republicans are unwilling to address,\" said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, the committee's ranking Democratic member.\n\nRep. Mike McCaul, the Republican chairman of the committee, said of the hearing: \"Racial intolerance deserves no place in America, and it is imperative that we find ways to rid our nation of the scourge

So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. said it was important to work toward the goal of Booker's legislation, but he also sought to keep the attention on Trump's comments about what occurred in Charlottesville.\n\n\"We must continue to denounce and resist President Trump for his reprehensible actions,\" Schumer tweeted.\n\nSimilarly, an aide to Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said the senator supports Booker's proposal, but he is focused on other issues as well.\n\nA spokeswoman for Kaine, Sarah Peck, said the senator \"also believes the Senate needs to work to combat hate crimes and address the fundamental inequities in our society that have left African-Americans and families of color in this country with far less wealth, higher unemployment rates, fewer opportunities and less protection under the law.\"\n\nDemocratic lawmakers are also calling for Congress to focus more attention on the threat of domestic terrorism. The House Homeland Security Committee will hold a hearing on Sept. 12, with the panel's chairman urging lawmakers to question witnesses on the dangers posed by domestic terrorists and other extremist groups. But Democrats complained that the hearing was part of an annual review that had already been scheduled before the Charlottesville events. They wanted more time to go into detail to address the threat from white supremacists and neo-Nazi groups.\n\n\"After years of requests for congressional hearings and the deaths of many, this is nothing more than attempt to distract from a topic the Republicans are unwilling to address,\" said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, the committee's ranking Democratic member.\n\nRep. Mike McCaul, the Republican chairman of the committee, said of the hearing: \"Racial intolerance deserves no place in America, and it is imperative that we find ways to rid our nation of the scourge of white supremacism.\"", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States",

So foolish!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nA growing number of Democratic lawmakers have called for the removal of Confederate monuments across the nation following a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that resulted in death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer.\n\nOn Aug. 16, Democratic Sen.

We have much work to do.\"\n\nIn 2016, the Southern Poverty Law Center estimated there were roughly 1,500 Confederate symbols in public spaces across the country, with nearly one-half in the form of statues, according to CNN.\n\nVirginia is host to more Confederate statues than any other state. Following the violence in Charlottesville, Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia called for all of the monuments to be torn down, the Washington Examiner reports.\n\n\"I hope we can all now agree that these symbols are a barrier to progress, inclusion and equality in Virginia and, while the decision may not be mine to make, I believe the path forward is clear,\" McAuliffe said.\n\nA spokesperson for Democratic Sen.

This is just one step. We have much work to do. -- Cory Booker (@CoryBooker)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nThere are at least 10 Confederate statues in the Capitol, distributed between the Hall of Columns, the Capitol Visitor Center and other locations, most notably Statuary Hall, where each state chooses two statues to be on display. When asked about the inclusion of Confederate statues in the Capitol, Doug Andres, a spokesman for House Speaker Paul Ryan said \"These are decisions for those states to make.\" CNN has also reached out to the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and has not yet received a response.Booker's communications director said that the senator will introduce the bill after Labor Day, as the Senate is currently on recess.Read MoreRELATED: Trump calls removal of Confederate monuments 'so foolish'As a growing number of American cities work to remove statues commemorating the Confederacy, Trump defended the statues again Thursday, arguing that removing them uproots American \"culture\" and history.\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he said in a series of tweets. \"You ... can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also ... the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\" he tweeted.Activists expressed interest and support for removing statues honoring Confederate soldiers and the Mississippi state flag, which includes a Confederate symbol, after the June 2015 massacre in Charleston, South Carolina, where Dylann Roof, a white supremacist who was photographed with Confederate memorabilia, killed nine black Americans during a church prayer service. RELATED: Here are 1,500 symbols of the Confederacy in the USFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley signed a bill in July 2015 to bring down the Confederate flag on the statehouse grounds, less than a day after lawmakers in the state House of Representatives voted to remove it.Centered in the Deep South but stretching from California to Massachusetts, roughly 1,500 Confederate symbols still exist on public land more than 150 years after the conclusion of the Civil War, according to 2016 data from the Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama-based advocacy nonprofit organization that tracks civil rights and hate crimes in the United States.Roughly half of those symbols -- 718 of them as of last year -- are monuments and statues. Three in four of them were built before 1950, but at least one in 10 of them were dedicated during the civil rights movement or since the year 2000.\n\nCNN's Deirdre Walsh contributed to this

So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. said it was important to work toward the goal of Booker's legislation, but he also sought to keep the attention on Trump's comments about what occurred in Charlottesville.\n\n\"We must continue to denounce and resist President Trump for his reprehensible actions,\" Schumer tweeted.\n\nSimilarly, an aide to Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said the senator supports Booker's proposal, but he is focused on other issues as well.\n\nA spokeswoman for Kaine, Sarah Peck, said the senator \"also believes the Senate needs to work to combat hate crimes and address the fundamental inequities in our society that have left African-Americans and families of color in this country with far less wealth, higher unemployment rates, fewer opportunities and less protection under the law.\"\n\nDemocratic lawmakers are also calling for Congress to focus more attention on the threat of domestic terrorism. The House Homeland Security Committee will hold a hearing on Sept. 12, with the panel's chairman urging lawmakers to question witnesses on the dangers posed by domestic terrorists and other extremist groups. But Democrats complained that the hearing was part of an annual review that had already been scheduled before the Charlottesville events. They wanted more time to go into detail to address the threat from white supremacists and neo-Nazi groups.\n\n\"After years of requests for congressional hearings and the deaths of many, this is nothing more than attempt to distract from a topic the Republicans are unwilling to address,\" said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, the committee's ranking Democratic member.\n\nRep. Mike McCaul, the Republican chairman of the committee, said of the hearing: \"Racial intolerance deserves no place in America, and it is imperative that we find ways to rid our nation of the scourge of white supremacism.\"\n\n___\n\nOn Twitter, reach Kevin Freking at https://twitter.com/APkfreking\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Cory Booker, D-N.J., will introduce legislation after Congress reconvenes next month calling for the removal of at least a dozen statues of Confederate soldiers and politicians located inside the U.S. Capitol.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi wants to remove the statues, too, calling on House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, to support legislation to do so. Ohio Democratic U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan made a similar request.\n\nThe move follows similar action by many city officials around the country who are considering removal of Confederate statues and other memorials in an effort to avoid the kind of unrest that occurred in Charlottesville as alt-right and white nationalist groups across the country vow to stage more rallies.\n\nBooker made the announcement Wednesday night on Twitter, saying, \"This is just one step. We have much work to do.\"\n\n\"I will be introducing a bill to remove Confederate statues from the US Capitol building. This is just one step. We have much work to do.\n\n- Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) August 17, 2017\"\n\nPelosi and Ohio's Ryan followed with their support Thursday. Pelosi said that when she was House speaker, \"we relocated Robert E. Lee out of a place of honor in National Statuary Hall - a place now occupied by the statue of Rosa Parks.\"\n\n\"The halls of Congress are the very heart of our democracy,\" Pelosi said in a statement. \"The statues in the Capitol should embody our highest ideals as Americans, expressing who we are and who we aspire to be as a nation.\"\n\nRyan said that statues of Confederates \"or Confederate sympathizers have no place in the Halls of Congress and should be removed immediately.\"\n\n\"The cause that these Confederate leaders supported would have seen the Capitol building burned to the ground, the Republic which it represents torn apart, and the countless African American Representatives, Senators, staffers, and visitors who work and visit there every day viewed as property simply because of the color of their skin,\" Ryan said in a statement. \"Those are not values worthy of display in this Capitol or any corner of our nation.\"\n\nThe monuments include statues of Robert E. Lee, Edward Douglass White and Joseph Wheeler, which are part of the Capitol's National Statuary Hall Collection. There are a dozen statues of Confederate soldiers and politicians in that collection alone, compared to just four of black leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. that are sprinkled throughout the entire complex, according to the Architect of the Capitol.\n\nAt the local level, city and civil leaders are concerned the presence of Confederate monuments might make their cities a flash point for future demonstrations by white nationalist groups. That fear prompted the city of Baltimore to remove four Confederate monuments in the darkness early Wednesday morning.\n\nHours after the monuments' removal, more than 1,000 people gathered at a memorial service for Heather Heyer in Charlottesville, who was killed last week when a car allegedly driven by a Nazi sympathizer plowed into a crowd of counterprotesters at a white supremacist rally at the University of Virginia. The rally was organized to condemn a decision by the city to remove a statue of Lee.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "wgt": 100, "id": 393, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "wgt": 100, "id": 757, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death_Care", "wgt": 100, "id": 927, "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death Care"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "type": "loc", "id": "189313"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "200134"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219910"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "loc", "id": "235649"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302546", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302944", "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303774", "label": {"eng": "Statue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303921", "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304050", "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304059", "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304323", "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304393", "label": {"eng": "African American"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ryan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304743", "label": {"eng": "Paul Ryan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304752", "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305004", "label": {"eng": "Legislation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "305157", "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305960", "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "314096", "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "314772", "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "321793", "label": {"eng": "Martin Luther King, Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "340176", "label": {"eng": "Cory Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Parks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "352826", "label": {"eng": "Rosa Parks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "360432", "label": {"eng": "Robert E.

Lee from a public park, before the rally turned violent and resulted in the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer when a driver plowed through a sea of counter-protesters. The events in Charlottesville have sparked some local, state and national politicians to call for the removal of Confederate memorials.\n\nPelosi did not remove the Confederate symbols when she was speaker from 2007 to 2011. When she was speaker, she said, Democrats did relocate a statue of Lee \"out of a place of honor\" in National Statutory Hall. Rosa Parks now has that place.\n\n\"There is no room for celebrating the violent bigotry of the men of the Confederacy in the hallowed halls of the United States Capitol or in places of honor across the country,\" Pelosi said.\n\nBut states decide what statutes they want to send to the Capitol to honor notable people in their history. For Congress to have a say in the matter, Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, said he will introduce legislation to remove Confederate statutes from Capitol grounds.\n\nPresident Trump on Twitter early Thursday morning decried the removal of \"beautiful\" statues and monuments that depict \"history and culture.\"\n\nThe president on Tuesday said he feared the removal of Confederate statutes might lead to the removal of other statues, like those of former presidents Thomas Jefferson and George Washington.\n\n\"Not all those people [at the rally] were white supremacists. Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue Robert E. Lee,\" Mr. Trump said in remarks to the press at Trump Tower in New York City on Tuesday.\n\n\"So, excuse me, when you take a look of some of the groups and you see, and you'd know if if you were honest reporters and many of you are not, many of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi also called for the statues to be removed, calling the Confederate symbols 'reprehensible.'\n\nThis would force states to replace 12 of the 100 statues from the National Statuary Collection.\n\nPresident Trump and several other Republicans have spoken out against removing Confederate statues, claiming doing so erases history and opens the floodgates to have other historical figures deemed racist scrutinized. Trump doubled down on his claims Thursday calling the monuments 'beautiful.'\n\nBooker, a New Jersey Democrat, tweeted Wednesday: 'I will be introducing a bill to remove Confederate statues from the US Capitol building. This is just one step. We have much work to do.'\n\nScroll down for video\n\nMany of the statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection were donated as early as the 1860s. Ten states chose to honor a figure who supported the Confederacy\n\nUnder the new proposed legislation, South Carolina would have to chose two new figures to represent it in the Capitol. Currently, statues of Confederate Cavalry Lieutenant General Wade Hampton (left) and John Caldwell Calhoun (right), whose beliefs influenced the state to secede, are included in the National Statuary Collection\n\nMississippi would have to find two new figures to replace its statues of Confederate President Jefferson Davis (left) and Private James Zachariah George (right)\n\nConfederate General Robert E Lee (left) represents state state of Virginia in the statue collection. It would have to be replaced along with Confederate Lieutenant General Joseph Wheeler (right), a gift from Alabama\n\nOn Thursday, Pelosi echoed his sentiments in a statement, saying: 'The halls of Congress are the very heart of our democracy. The statues in the Capitol should embody our highest ideals as Americans, expressing who we are and who we aspire to be as a nation.'\n\n'The Confederate statues in the halls of Congress have always been reprehensible. If Republicans are serious about rejecting white supremacy, I call upon Speaker Ryan to join Democrats to remove the Confederate statues from the Capitol immediately.'\n\n'Under the leadership of Democrats in Congress, we have recognized more women and people of color in Congress's collection of statues, including Rosa Parks, Sojourner Truth and Helen Keller. As Speaker, we relocated Robert E. Lee out of a place of honor in National Statuary Hall - a place now occupied by the statue of Rosa Parks.'\n\n'There is no room for celebrating the violent bigotry of the men of the Confederacy in the hallowed halls of the United States Capitol or in places of honor across the country.'\n\nSenator Cory Booker, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, proposed removing Confederate statues from the Capitol on Thursday\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the statues 'reprehensible' Thursday and echoed Booker's call to have them removed\n\nThe code related to the collection was on enacted on July 2, 1864 and gives the President the authorization to invite states to select two statues each, meaning this legislation could challenge Trump's power.\n\nToday, 35 of these statues are displayed in the Statuary Hall and the rest are scattered throughout the Capitol.\n\nThe figure must be 'illustrious for their historic renown or for distinguished civic or military services.' Ten states chose to honor a figure who supported or fought for the Confederacy.\n\nThe call from members of the Congressional Black Caucus to remove the statues comes in the wake of the riots in Charlottesville, where white nationalists traveled to protest the removal of a statue honoring Confederate General Robert E Lee.\n\nCurrently, there are no African Americans represented in the collection.\n\nThe concept of having states donate statues to represent them originated in 1857 before the completion of the House wing. States are allowed to replace statues with approval from the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress. Some of them were donated as early as the 1860s.\n\nThis new legislation would force 10 states to pick a new statue and South Carolina and Mississippi would have to chose two new statues entirely.\n\nIt is likely the legislation will be met with opposition considering every state with a Confederate statue is majority Republican.\n\nZebulon Vance (left) fought as a Confederate military officer and later became the governor of North Carolina. While Arkansas lawyer Uriah Milton Rose (right) did not fight for the Confederacy, he was loyal to Arkansas during the Civil War and collected records of the soldiers\n\nConfederate General Edmund Kirby Smith's (left) inscription reads he is Florida's 'most distinguished soldier.' Louisiana Senator and Supreme Court justice Edward Douglass White (right) was an infantryman in the Confederate army\n\nWest Virginia native John Kenna (left) fought in the Confederate army and went on to be a senator. Alexander Hamilton Stephens was the Vice President of the Confederacy and represents Georgia (right)\n\nOn Thursday Trump tweeted: 'Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments.'\n\n'You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish'!\n\n'Also, the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!'\n\nIn 2015, House Republicans blocked legislation proposed by CBC Chairman Representative Bennie Thompson to remove Confederate flag symbols from the Capitol.\n\nThis came as a response to the tragedy at a historically black Charleston church where white supremacist Dylann Roof murdered nine African Americans.\n\nSTATES WITH CONFEDERATE STATUES IN THE CAPITOL\n\nGeorgia\n\nAlexander Hamilton Stephens: state representative before becoming the Confederate vice president through the entire Civil War\n\nFlorida\n\nEdmund Kirby Smith: Confederate general, commanded the Army of East Tennessee, president of the Atlantic and Pacific Telegraph Company\n\nLouisiana\n\nEdward Douglass White: infantryman in the Confederate army, later became a senator and a Supreme Court chief justice\n\nMississippi\n\nJames Zachariah George: Confederate colonel who was captured twice during the Civil War, later became a senator, championed 'restoring white supremacy'\n\nJefferson Davis: senator who became the President of the Confederate States who was jailed for two years after the Civil War, later wrote 'Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government'\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nJohn Caldwell Calhoun: Though he died in 1850 before the Civil War, his strong belief in slavery inspired the Southern separatism 15 years after his death.

This is just one step. We have much work to do,\" the New Jersey Democrat tweeted Wednesday.\n\nThere are at least 10 Confederate statues in the Capitol, distributed between the Hall of Columns, the Capitol Visitor Center and other locations, most notably Statuary Hall, where each state chooses two statues to be on display.\n\nWhen asked about the inclusion of Confederate statues in the Capitol, Doug Andres, a spokesman for House Speaker Paul Ryan said \"These are decisions for those states to make.\" CNN has also reached out to the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and has not yet received a response.\n\nBooker's communications director said that the senator will introduce the bill after Labor Day, as the Senate is currently on recess.\n\nRELATED: Trump calls removal of Confederate monuments 'so foolish'\n\nAs a growing number of American cities work to remove statues commemorating the Confederacy, Trump defended the statues again Thursday, arguing that removing them uproots American \"culture\" and history.\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he said in a series of tweets. \"You ... can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also ... the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\" he tweeted.\n\nActivists expressed interest and support for removing statues honoring Confederate soldiers and the Mississippi state flag, which includes a Confederate symbol, after the June 2015 massacre in Charleston, South Carolina, where Dylann Roof, a white supremacist who was photographed with Confederate memorabilia, killed nine black Americans during a church prayer service.\n\nRELATED: Here are 1,500 symbols of the Confederacy in the US\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley signed a bill in July 2015 to bring down the Confederate flag on the statehouse grounds, less than a day after lawmakers in the state House of Representatives voted to remove it.\n\nCentered in the Deep South but stretching from California to Massachusetts, roughly 1,500 Confederate symbols still exist on public land more than 150 years after the conclusion of the Civil War, according to 2016 data from the Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama-based advocacy nonprofit organization that tracks civil rights and hate crimes in the United States.\n\nRoughly half of those symbols -- 718 of them as of last year -- are monuments and statues. Three in four of them were built before 1950, but at least one in 10 of them were dedicated during the civil rights movement or since the year 2000.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri":

Cory Booker (D-N.J.) plans to craft legislation that would remove the Capitol's statues lionizing supporters of the slave-holding era and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called for their elimination.\n\nPelosi on Thursday urged Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and other Republicans to join her in supporting removal of the Confederate figures from the Capitol, lending new momentum to Booker's effort. Only a few Democrats had previously called for the statues' removal after white supremacists staged a violent rally in Charlottesville over that city's likeness of Robert E. Lee.\n\n\"The Confederate statues in the halls of Congress have always been reprehensible,\" Pelosi said in a statement. \"If Republicans are serious about rejecting white supremacy, I call upon Speaker Ryan to join Democrats to remove the Confederate statues from the Capitol immediately.\"\n\nCongressional GOP leaders have previously stated that decisions on replacing Capitol statues should rest with individual states, and Ryan's office affirmed that stance earlier this week, POLITICO reported. A Ryan spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment on Pelosi's entreaty.\n\nThe push to remove the Capitol's Confederate iconography promises to reopen an emotional debate that presents pitfalls for both parties.\n\nIn the wake of the Charlottesville rally, which left one woman dead and more than a dozen injured, Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D-Va.) and Ralph Northam, the Democratic nominee in November's election to replace him, have come out in favor of replacing the state's Confederate monuments.\n\nThe issue is more complicated for members of Congress, however, thanks to long-standing guidelines that empower state legislatures to select the statues in the Capitol that honor prominent citizens from their states.\n\nEven so, Congress could eliminate all Confederate statues via legislation and Booker said Wednesday night that he would propose that move. \"This is just one step,\" Booker tweeted. \"We have much work to do.\"\n\nPelosi, who orchestrated the movement of Lee's likeness from Statuary Hall near the Capitol Rotunda to a less prominent spot on the first floor of the building, took a firm stance on Thursday.\n\n\"There is no room for celebrating the violent bigotry of the men of the Confederacy in the hallowed halls of the United States Capitol or in places of honor across the country,\" she said.\n\nThere are 10 statues in the Capitol's National Statuary Hall Collection honoring individuals who served in the Confederate army or government. Others depict supporters of slavery or the Confederacy, such as former Secretary of State and Sen. John C. Calhoun and Uriah Milton Rose of Arkansas.\n\nLeaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus are also backing removal of the Capitol's Confederate statues. A spokeswoman for the Congressional Black Caucus said Tuesday the group is not presently proposing any legislative solution because GOP leaders back leaving the decisions to individual states.\n\nBooker's legislation promises to put Virginia Democratic Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine in the spotlight given the sensitivity of the issue in their state.\n\nWarner said Thursday that he and Booker are talking \"about how we might move forward on\" the Confederate statues housed within Congress.\n\n\"[T]his is a conversation that is going to, I think, go on now for some time, but I think that everybody needs to have a chance to be heard,\" Warner told a radio station in Richmond. The former Virginia governor also noted that \"there's going to have to be a local process in every community, and we're going to have to have tough, and in many ways overdue conversations, about race.\"\n\nWhile serving as Richmond mayor in the 1990s, Kaine spearheaded the installation of a statue commemorating African-American tennis champion Arthur Ashe and released an official apology for the city's participation in slavery -- but he also has supported local conversations about potential monument removal.\n\n\"Sen. Kaine thinks Sen. Booker's proposal is a good idea, and he plans to work with him on the bill and support it,\" a Kaine spokesperson said Thursday. \"He also believes the Senate needs to work to address the fundamental inequities in our society that have left African-Americans and families of color in this country with far less wealth, higher unemployment rates, fewer opportunities and less protection under the law.\"\n\nDemocrats are also facing a growing push from civil rights groups and outside-the-Beltway activists to take a stronger stand on the remaining statues in the Capitol as cities from Baltimore to Jacksonville take on removal of their Confederate monuments.\n\n\"This is a moment for members of Congress to come together to show that they are not complicit with those who sow hate and division,\" Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said in a statement. \"One way to show they do not support white nationalists would be to take a serious look at symbols of hate and monuments to racial discrimination that are enshrined in our nation's Capitol.\"\n\nIn addition, Trump's alignment with supporters of maintaining the Confederate iconography could influence Democratic decision-making. Trump's call on Thursday to maintain Confederate monuments, comparing Lee and Stonewall Jackson to the Founding Fathers, mark an escalation from remarks earlier this week in which he said the issue should be discussed on a case-by-case basis.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place",

Flake's Primary Foe]\n\n\"I will be introducing a bill to remove Confederate statues from the US Capitol building,\" Booker wrote.\n\nHe called the potential move \"just one step,\" adding the country has \"much work to do\" on race relations and related topics.\n\nI will be introducing a bill to remove Confederate statues from the US Capitol building. This is just one step. We have much work to do. --\n\nCory Booker (@CoryBooker) August 17, 2017\n\nThere are a dozen Confederate statues in the Capitol's National Statuary Hall Collection, according to the Architect of the Capitol. That list includes statues of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee, who commanded the secessionist states' military during the Civil War.\n\nEach state is allotted two statues in the Capitol building. State governments decide their statues and whether the statues should be replaced.\n\nCongress set the parameters for replacing Capitol statues in 2000. The rules tate that a state can say permission to replace a statue as long as the state legislature and governor have approved a resolution asking that the state be replaced, and that the statue being replaced has been in the Capitol for at least 10 years.\n\nIt was a plan by Charlottesville officials to take down a Lee statute there that drew the white supremacist groups to organize their Friday night torch march and Saturday protest.\n\nOther African-American lawmakers this week have said they want the Capitol's Confederate statues to be removed. A Congressional Black Caucus spokesperson told Roll Call, however, that the group is not crafting any legislation to that end.\n\n[Trump Hits Lindsey Graham Over Alleged 'Disgusting Lie']\n\nWhether any such bill could pass both chambers is questionable. It is not clear Republicans, especially ones hailing from southern states where Confederate figures remain iconic, would risk angering constituents by voting to remove the statues heading into the 2018 midterm election cycle.\n\nWhat's more, President Donald Trump would have to sign the legislation into law. But he made his view of Confederate statutes clear during a combative press conference on Tuesday, during which the president appeared to give cover to Confederate Flag-toting white supremacists who participated in the Charlottesville protests and are part of his political base -- which he talks about and praises often.\n\n\"This week it's Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down,\" Trump fumed. \"I wonder is it George Washington next week and is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\"\n\nThe president did say that is should be up to local officials to decide whether to take down Confederate statues.\n\nBut in Thursday morning tweets, the president said that the history and culture of the country was being \"ripped apart\" by removing \"our beautiful statues and monuments.\"\n\nSad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You..... -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\n...can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also... -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\n...the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nBooker could be playing right into the White House's hands. Trump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, who has been accused by Republicans and Democrats alike for alleged ties to alt-right and pro-white groups, this week made clear he welcomes debates about race.\n\n\"The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em,\" he told the American Prospect publication -- though he has since claimed he did not know the conversation was on the record.\n\n\"I want them to talk about racism every day,\" Bannon said. \"If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"", "date":

The legislation can't pass without support from Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress.\n\nPelosi said the statues in the Capitol should \"embody our highest ideals as Americans, expressing who we are and who we aspire to be as a nation.\"\n\nPelosi's challenge comes as violence during a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, has stoked calls to remove Confederate statues elsewhere. About 10 statues in the Capitol's Statuary Hall are of men who served as Confederate soldiers or politicians.\n\n\"The Confederate statues in the halls of Congress have always been reprehensible,\" Pelosi said in a statement. \"If Republicans are serious about rejecting white supremacy, I call upon Speaker Ryan to join Democrats to remove the Confederate statues from the Capitol immediately.\"\n\nEach state is allowed to place two statues in the Capitol's National Statuary Hall. Doug Andres, a spokesman for Ryan, said the display of statues is a decision for the states to make.\n\nThe statues in Statuary Hall are required to be of someone deceased for at least 10 years and must be made of marble or bronze. An exception was made for the statue of Rosa Parks, which was moved to its current location in 2013, as well as for any replacement statues, according to a Congressional Research Service report.\n\nAmong the statues present are of those of Gen. Robert E. Lee, Virginia; Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederate States of America, Mississippi; and Alexander Hamilton Stephens, the Confederate vice president, Georgia.\n\nSen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, announced earlier that he would be sponsoring legislation to remove Confederate statues from the Capitol.\n\n\"This is just one step,\" Booker said. \"We have much work to do.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump is strongly criticizing efforts to remove memorials and tributes to the Confederacy.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted Thursday. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. said it was important to work toward the goal of Booker's legislation, but he also sought to keep the attention on Trump's comments about what occurred in Charlottesville.\n\n\"We must continue to denounce and resist President Trump for his reprehensible actions,\" Schumer tweeted.\n\nSimilarly, an aide to Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said the senator supports Booker's proposal, but he is focused on other issues as well.\n\nA spokeswoman for Kaine, Sarah Peck, said the senator \"also believes the Senate needs to work to combat hate crimes and address the fundamental inequities in our society that have left African-Americans and families of color in this country with far less wealth, higher unemployment rates, fewer opportunities and less protection under the law.\"\n\nDemocratic lawmakers are also calling for Congress to focus more attention on the threat of domestic terrorism. The House Homeland Security Committee will hold a hearing on Sept. 12, with the panel's chairman urging lawmakers to question witnesses on the dangers posed by domestic terrorists and other extremist groups. But Democrats complained that the hearing was part of an annual review that had already been scheduled before the Charlottesville events. They wanted more time to go into detail to address the threat from white supremacists and neo-Nazi groups.\n\n\"After years of requests for congressional hearings and the deaths of many, this is nothing more than attempt to distract from a topic the Republicans are unwilling to address,\" said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, the committee's ranking Democratic member.\n\nRep. Mike McCaul, the Republican chairman of the committee, said of the hearing: \"Racial intolerance deserves no place in America, and it is imperative that we find ways to rid our nation of the scourge of white supremacism.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\nOn Twitter, reach Kevin Freking at https://twitter.com/APkfreking", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country",

The legislation can't pass without support from Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress.\n\nPelosi said the statues in the Capitol should \"embody our highest ideals as Americans, expressing who we are and who we aspire to be as a nation.\"\n\nPelosi's challenge comes as violence during a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, has stoked calls to remove Confederate statues elsewhere. About 10 statues in the Capitol's Statuary Hall are of men who served as Confederate soldiers or politicians.\n\n\"The Confederate statues in the halls of Congress have always been reprehensible,\" Pelosi said in a statement. \"If Republicans are serious about rejecting white supremacy, I call upon Speaker Ryan to join Democrats to remove the Confederate statues from the Capitol immediately.\"\n\nEach state is allowed to place two statues in the Capitol's National Statuary Hall. Doug Andres, a spokesman for Ryan, said the display of statues is a decision for the states to make.\n\nThe statues in Statuary Hall are required to be of someone deceased for at least 10 years and must be made of marble or bronze. An exception was made for the statue of Rosa Parks, which was moved to its current location in 2013, as well as for any replacement statues, according to a Congressional Research Service report.\n\nAmong the statues present are of those of Gen. Robert E. Lee, Virginia; Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederate States of America, Mississippi; and Alexander Hamilton Stephens, the Confederate vice president, Georgia.\n\nSen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, announced earlier that he would be sponsoring legislation to remove Confederate statues from the Capitol.\n\n\"This is just one step,\" Booker said. \"We have much work to do.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump is strongly criticizing efforts to remove memorials and tributes to the Confederacy.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted Thursday. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. said it was important to work toward the goal of Booker's legislation, but he also sought to keep the attention on Trump's comments about what occurred in Charlottesville.\n\n\"We must continue to denounce and resist President Trump for his reprehensible actions,\" Schumer tweeted.\n\nSimilarly, an aide to Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said the senator supports Booker's proposal, but he is focused on other issues as well.\n\nA spokeswoman for Kaine, Sarah Peck, said the senator \"also believes the Senate needs to work to combat hate crimes and address the fundamental inequities in our society that have left African-Americans and families of color in this country with far less wealth, higher unemployment rates, fewer opportunities and less protection under the law.\"\n\nDemocratic lawmakers are also calling for Congress to focus more attention on the threat of domestic terrorism. The House Homeland Security Committee will hold a hearing on Sept. 12, with the panel's chairman urging lawmakers to question witnesses on the dangers posed by domestic terrorists and other extremist groups. But Democrats complained that the hearing was part of an annual review that had already been scheduled before the Charlottesville events. They wanted more time to go into detail to address the threat from white supremacists and neo-Nazi groups.\n\n\"After years of requests for congressional hearings and the deaths of many, this is nothing more than attempt to distract from a topic the Republicans are unwilling to address,\" said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, the committee's ranking Democratic member.\n\nRep. Mike McCaul, the Republican chairman of the committee, said of the hearing: \"Racial intolerance deserves no place in America, and it is imperative that we find ways to rid our nation of the scourge of white supremacism.\"\n\n___\n\nOn Twitter, reach Kevin Freking at https://twitter.com/APkfreking", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label":

The legislation can't pass without support from Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress.\n\nPelosi said the statues in the Capitol should \"embody our highest ideals as Americans, expressing who we are and who we aspire to be as a nation.\"\n\nPelosi's challenge comes as violence during a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, has stoked calls to remove Confederate statues elsewhere. About 10 statues in the Capitol's Statuary Hall are of men who served as Confederate soldiers or politicians.\n\n\"The Confederate statues in the halls of Congress have always been reprehensible,\" Pelosi said in a statement. \"If Republicans are serious about rejecting white supremacy, I call upon Speaker Ryan to join Democrats to remove the Confederate statues from the Capitol immediately.\"\n\nEach state is allowed to place two statues in the Capitol's National Statuary Hall. Doug Andres, a spokesman for Ryan, said the display of statues is a decision for the states to make.\n\nThe statues in Statuary Hall are required to be of someone deceased for at least 10 years and must be made of marble or bronze. An exception was made for the statue of Rosa Parks, which was moved to its current location in 2013, as well as for any replacement statues, according to a Congressional Research Service report.\n\nAmong the statues present are of those of Gen. Robert E. Lee, Virginia; Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederate States of America, Mississippi; and Alexander Hamilton Stephens, the Confederate vice president, Georgia.\n\nSen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, announced earlier that he would be sponsoring legislation to remove Confederate statues from the Capitol.\n\n\"This is just one step,\" Booker said. \"We have much work to do.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump is strongly criticizing efforts to remove memorials and tributes to the Confederacy.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted Thursday. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. said it was important to work toward the goal of Booker's legislation, but he also sought to keep the attention on Trump's comments about what occurred in Charlottesville.\n\n\"We must continue to denounce and resist President Trump for his reprehensible actions,\" Schumer tweeted.\n\nSimilarly, an aide to Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said the senator supports Booker's proposal, but he is focused on other issues as well.\n\nA spokeswoman for Kaine, Sarah Peck, said the senator \"also believes the Senate needs to work to combat hate crimes and address the fundamental inequities in our society that have left African-Americans and families of color in this country with far less wealth, higher unemployment rates, fewer opportunities and less protection under the law.\"\n\nDemocratic lawmakers are also calling for Congress to focus more attention on the threat of domestic terrorism. The House Homeland Security Committee will hold a hearing on Sept. 12, with the panel's chairman urging lawmakers to question witnesses on the dangers posed by domestic terrorists and other extremist groups. But Democrats complained that the hearing was part of an annual review that had already been scheduled before the Charlottesville events. They wanted more time to go into detail to address the threat from white supremacists and neo-Nazi groups.\n\n\"After years of requests for congressional hearings and the deaths of many, this is nothing more than attempt to distract from a topic the Republicans are unwilling to address,\" said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, the committee's ranking Democratic member.\n\nRep. Mike McCaul, the Republican chairman of the committee, said of the hearing: \"Racial intolerance deserves no place in America, and it is imperative that we find ways to rid our nation of the scourge of white supremacism.\"\n\n___\n\nOn Twitter, reach Kevin Freking at https://twitter.com/APkfreking\n\nPublished: August 17, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 3:01 AM EDT | Updated: August 17, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 4:14 PM EDT\n\nThanks for your continued support...\n\nWe recently asked you to support our journalism.

The statues in the Capitol should embody the highest ideals as Americans, expressing who we are and who we aspire to be as a nation,\" she said.\n\nPelosi called on House Speaker Paul Ryan to join the Democrats in supporting legislation to remove Confederate statues from the Capitol.\n\n\"The Confederate statues in the halls of Congress have always been reprehensible. If Republicans are serious about rejecting white supremacy, I call upon Speaker Ryan to join Democrats to remove the Confederate statues from the Capitol immediately,\" Pelosi said.\n\nPelosi said under the leadership of Democrats in the Congress, they have recognised more women and people of colour in Congress's collection of statues, including Rosa Parks, Sojourner Truth and Helen Keller.\n\n\"As Speaker, we relocated Robert E Lee out of a place of honour in National Statuary Hall a place now occupied by the statue of Rosa Parks,\" she said.\n\nCongresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton called on House and Senate leaders to create a special committee in Congress to encourage States with statues of confederate figures to take advantage of a federal law that allows states to replace their statues for any reason.\n\nThere are 12 Confederate statues in the Statuary Hall Collection from Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia.\n\nNorton said that the special committee could help states follow in the footsteps of Alabama, which has already replaced one of its statues of a Confederate soldier with one of Helen Keller, and of Florida, which is working to replace its statue of a Confederate general with a more appropriate alternative.\n\nEach of the 50 states has two statues that are representative of their home states, and the District of Columbia has one.\n\nCongressman Tim Ryan said statues of Confederates or Confederate sympathisers have no place in the Halls of Congress and should be removed immediately.\n\n\"Taking down monuments of confederate leaders and sympathisers is not erasing history; it is taking a stand against the glorification of those who fought to end our nation as we know it for the purpose of subjugating an entire race of people,\" Ryan said.\n\nCongressmen Adriano Espaillat and Dwight Evans introduced a legislation to prohibit Federal funds from being used to create, maintain, or display, as applicable, any Confederate symbol on Federal public land, including any highway, park, subway, Federal building, military base, street, or other Federal property.\n\nThere are at least 1,503 remaining symbols of the Confederacy in public spaces, including 109 public schools named after prominent Confederates, many with large African- American student populations; more than 700 Confederate monuments and statues on public property throughout the country, the vast majority in the South that include 96 monuments in Virginia, 90 in Georgia, and 90 in North Carolina.\n\nAdditionally, there are 17 US military bases named in honour of Confederate military leaders.\n\n\"These hateful symbols are a constant reminder of what our ancestors endured. No federal funding should be utilised for any Confederate symbol on Federal public lands. If we want our nation to heal and move forward, we must remove these abhorrent symbols at once,\" said Congressman Dwight Evans.\n\nA Republican lawmaker also joined the anti-confederate statue call.\n\n\"When they're in the Capitol, they're almost in a place of reverence. And I don't think that we should revere what those guys stood for. I think the right side won the war,\" Congressman Tom Rooney told The Hill in an interview.\n\n\"If the context was right in describing who he was and what he was fighting for, so people understand that he was fighting to keep slavery as part of this country I guess as long as it's put in context but I don't like the site of the one in Charlottesville where he's way up on a pedestal,

Also ... the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\" he tweeted.\n\nActivists expressed interest and support for removing statues honoring Confederate soldiers and the Mississippi state flag, which includes a Confederate symbol, after the June 2015 massacre in Charleston, South Carolina, where Dylann Roof, a white supremacist who was photographed with Confederate memorabilia, killed nine black Americans during a church prayer service.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley signed a bill in July 2015 to bring down the Confederate flag on the statehouse grounds, less than a day after lawmakers in the state House of Representatives voted to remove it.\n\nCentered in the Deep South but stretching from California to Massachusetts, roughly 1,500 Confederate symbols still exist on public land more than 150 years after the conclusion of the Civil War, according to 2016 data from the Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama-based advocacy nonprofit organization that tracks civil rights and hate crimes in the United States.\n\nRoughly half of those symbols -- 718 of them as of last year -- are monuments and statues.

If Republicans are serious about rejecting white supremacy, I call upon Speaker Ryan to join Democrats to remove the Confederate statues from the Capitol immediately,\" Pelosi said.\n\nPelosi said under the leadership of Democrats in the Congress, they have recognised more women and people of colour in Congress's collection of statues, including Rosa Parks, Sojourner Truth and Helen Keller.\n\n\"As Speaker, we relocated Robert E Lee out of a place of honour in National Statuary Hall a place now occupied by the statue of Rosa Parks,\" she said.\n\nCongresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton called on House and Senate leaders to create a special committee in Congress to encourage States with statues of confederate figures to take advantage of a federal law that allows states to replace their statues for any reason.\n\nThere are 12 Confederate statues in the Statuary Hall Collection from Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia.\n\nNorton said that the special committee could help states follow in the footsteps of Alabama, which has already replaced one of its statues of a Confederate soldier with one of Helen Keller, and of Florida, which is working to replace its statue of a Confederate general with a more appropriate alternative. Each of the 50 states has two statues that are representative of their home states, and the District of Columbia has one.\n\nCongressman Tim Ryan said statues of Confederates or Confederate sympathisers have no place in the Halls of Congress and should be removed immediately.\n\n\"Taking down monuments of confederate leaders and sympathisers is not erasing history; it is taking a stand against the glorification of those who fought to end our nation as we know it for the purpose of subjugating an entire race of people,\" Ryan said.\n\nCongressmen Adriano Espaillat and Dwight Evans introduced a legislation to prohibit Federal funds from being used to create, maintain, or display, as applicable, any Confederate symbol on Federal public land, including any highway, park, subway, Federal building, military base, street, or other Federal property.\n\nThere are at least 1,503 remaining symbols of the Confederacy in public spaces, including 109 public schools named after prominent Confederates, many with large African- American student populations; more than 700 Confederate monuments and statues on public property throughout the country, the vast majority in the South that include 96 monuments in Virginia, 90 in Georgia, and 90 in North Carolina.\n\nAdditionally, there are 17 US military bases named in honour of Confederate military leaders.\n\n\"These hateful symbols are a constant reminder of what our ancestors endured. No federal funding should be utilised for any Confederate symbol on Federal public lands. If we want our nation to heal and move forward, we must remove these abhorrent symbols at once,\" said Congressman Dwight Evans.\n\nA Republican lawmaker also joined the anti-confederate statue call.\n\n\"When they're in the Capitol, they're almost in a place of reverence. And I don't think that we should revere what those guys stood for. I think the right side won the war,\" Congressman Tom Rooney told The Hill in an interview.\n\n\"If the context was right in describing who he was and what he was fighting for, so people understand that he was fighting to keep slavery as part of this country I guess as long as it's put in context but I don't like the site of the one in Charlottesville where he's way up on a pedestal, literally,\" he said.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location":

Flake and attacks Sen. Graham Trump laments removal of Confederate monuments as loss to history, cultureWhite House strategist Stephen Bannon unloads in unsolicited call to liberal writerTrump plans Arizona rally, his first in West, but mayor says don't come All updates Congress Economy Immigration Media Watch: On the Right North Korea Obamacare Russia White House Aug. 17, 2017, 11:21 a.m. Nancy Pelosi calls on Speaker Ryan to remove Confederate statues from the Capitol Lisa Mascaro\n\nThe fight over Confederate statues is coming to the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe marbled halls have long been home to memorials for leaders of the Confederacy, and opposition to them has flared from time to time.\n\nBut now, in the aftermath of deadly violence in Charlottesville and President Trump's defense of what many see as nods to the country's segregated and slave-holding past, some lawmakers want them out.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday called on Speaker Paul Ryan to start the process for their removal.\n\n\"The Confederate statues in the halls of Congress have always been reprehensible,\" said Pelosi, the San Francisco Democrat.\n\n\"If Republicans are serious about rejecting white supremacy, I call upon Speaker Ryan to join Democrats to remove the Confederate statues from the Capitol immediately.\"\n\nA day earlier, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) announced he would file legislation to take the Confederate statues down.\n\nRyan's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRemoving the statues could allow Republicans in Congress to distance themselves from their uneasy relationship with Trump on the issue of race.\n\nRepublicans in Congress often try to ignore Trump's impolitic outbursts as they rely on him to help advance their legislative agenda into law.\n\nBut Trump's call for keeping Confederate statues in communities around the country - he tweeted Thursday that the nation's culture is being \"ripped apart\" by their removal -- after he had blamed \"both sides\" for the violence in Charlottesville, is forcing Republicans to respond.\n\nMoving statues out of the Capitol may be politically easier for Republicans to consider than calls for them to censure Trump himself.\n\nEvery state sends two statues to the Capitol's corridors, including its stately Statuary Hall. Most represent noted historical figures.\n\nCalifornia sent Ronald Reagan and Father Junipero Serra, Oklahoma has Will Rogers, Hawaii has among the most ornate towering figures, Kamehmeha I.\n\nNo state has sent a statue of an African-American. Congress has tried to remedy that in recent years with statues to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Frederick Douglass and others.\n\nOne analysis showed three times as many Confederates as black Americans fill the Capitol halls, according to the Washington Post.\n\nWhen Pelosi was House Speaker, from 2007 to 2011, the Democratic-led Congress relocated Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee out of the hall and a statue of civil rights heroine Rosa Parks now has the spot.\n\n\"There is no room for celebrating the violent bigotry of the men of the Confederacy in the hallowed halls of the United States Capitol or in places of honor across the country,\" Pelosi said.\n\nLatest updates Copyright \u00a9 2017, Los Angeles Times", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri":

About 10 statues in the Capitol's Statuary Hall are of men who served as Confederate soldiers or politicians.\n\n\"The Confederate statues in the halls of Congress have always been reprehensible,\" Pelosi said in a statement. \"If Republicans are serious about rejecting white supremacy, I call upon Speaker Ryan to join Democrats to remove the Confederate statues from the Capitol immediately.\"\n\nEach state is allowed to place two statues in the Capitol's National Statuary Hall. Doug Andres, a spokesman for Ryan, said the display of statues is a decision for the states to make.\n\nThe statues in Statuary Hall are required to be of someone deceased for at least 10 years and must be made of marble or bronze. An exception was made for the statue of Rosa Parks, which was moved to its current location in 2013, as well as for any replacement statues, according to a Congressional Research Service report.\n\nAmong the statues present are of those of Gen. Robert E. Lee, Virginia; Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederate States of America, Mississippi; and Alexander Hamilton Stephens, the Confederate vice president, Georgia.\n\nSen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, announced earlier that he would be sponsoring legislation to remove Confederate statues from the Capitol.\n\n\"This is just one step,\" Booker said. \"We have much work to do.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump is strongly criticizing efforts to remove memorials and tributes to the Confederacy.\n\n\"You can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted Thursday. \"Robert E. Lee. Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish. ...\n\n\"Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. said it was important to work toward the goal of Booker's legislation, but he also sought to keep the attention on Trump's comments about what occurred in Charlottesville.\n\n\"We must continue to denounce and resist President Trump for his reprehensible actions,\" Schumer tweeted.\n\nSimilarly, an aide to Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said the senator supports Booker's proposal, but he is focused on other issues as well.\n\nA spokeswoman for Kaine, Sarah Peck, said the senator \"also believes the Senate needs to work to combat hate crimes and address the fundamental inequities in our society that have left African-Americans and families of color in this country with far less wealth, higher unemployment rates, fewer opportunities and less protection under the law.\"\n\nDemocratic lawmakers are also calling for Congress to focus more attention on the threat of domestic terrorism. The House Homeland Security Committee will hold a hearing on Sept. 12, with the panel's chairman urging lawmakers to question witnesses on the dangers posed by domestic terrorists and other extremist groups. But Democrats complained that the hearing was part of an annual review that had already been scheduled before the Charlottesville events. They wanted more time to go into detail to address the threat from white supremacists and neo-Nazi groups.\n\n\"After years of requests for congressional hearings and the deaths of many, this is nothing more than attempt to distract from a topic the Republicans are unwilling to address,\" said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, the committee's ranking Democratic member.\n\nRep. Mike McCaul, the Republican chairman of the committee, said of the hearing: \"Racial intolerance deserves no place in America, and it is imperative that we find ways to rid our nation of the scourge of white supremacism.\"", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country",

Mic counts at least 39 movements nationally that have removed or are pushing to remove Confederate monuments on public land in 2017. At least eight monuments have been removed since Saturday's violence.\n\nFor his part, President Donald Trump reiterated his support for preserving the monuments in three Thursday tweets.\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" Trump said.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Hazardous_Materials", "wgt": 100, "id": 130, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Hazardous Materials"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious_Software", "wgt": 100, "id": 626, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious Software"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death_Care", "wgt": 100, "id": 927, "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death Care"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "200134"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "type": "loc", "id": "226024"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "type": "loc", "id": "227084"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "302942", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302944", "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304050", "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304059", "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304270", "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304323", "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304393", "label": {"eng": "African American"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ryan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304743", "label": {"eng": "Paul Ryan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304752", "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "305157", "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305165", "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305960", "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Davis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "306385", "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311590", "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "314096", "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314772", "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "314809", "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "315934", "label": {"eng": "Bicameralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "340176", "label": {"eng": "Cory Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Records", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "352240", "label": {"eng": "Capitol Latin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "360432", "label": {"eng": "Robert E.

I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down,\" he said during his shocking press conference on Tuesday. \"I wonder is it George Washington next week and is it Thomas Jefferson the week after?\n\n\"You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\"", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "wgt": 100, "id": 393, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious_Software", "wgt": 100, "id": 626, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious Software"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Building_Types", "wgt": 100, "id": 845, "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Building Types"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death_Care", "wgt": 100, "id": 927, "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death Care"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "type": "loc", "id": "189313"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "type": "loc", "id": "193144"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "200134"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "loc", "id": "235649"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "242096"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302546", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304262", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304736", "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305165", "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305960", "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "314772", "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "337858", "label": {"eng": "George Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "340176", "label": {"eng": "Cory Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "360432", "label": {"eng": "Robert E.

Cory Booker, D-N.J., said Wednesday he would introduce legislation that would mandate the removal of those statues, saying they \"should not be afforded such a rare honor in this sacred space.\"\n\n\"They are, unequivocally, not only statues of treasonous Americans, but are symbolic to some who seek to revise history and advance hate and division,\" he said.\n\nBooker's proposal comes after other calls for the elimination of Confederate iconography from the Capitol and other federal property. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus, for instance, successfully petitioned last year to have the state flag of Mississippi, which includes the Confederate battle herald, removed from display in a tunnel in the Capitol complex.\n\nSeparate efforts have aimed to remove the display of Confederate flags at federal cemeteries and to rename military posts that carry the names of Confederate generals.\n\nRep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., who has previously led efforts to attach a provision to prevent the display of Confederate flags at federal cemeteries to spending legislation, said Thursday that he anticipated that push would expand to other places under federal purview.\n\nThe deadly violence in Charlottesville \"reminds us how dangerous it is to indulge in revisionist history or euphemisms about what these symbols mean,\" he said. \"There's an interest at looking at all of it, not just the statutes or the military bases, but all of it.\"\n\nBut the top Democrat in the U.S. Senate struck a wary note Thursday, warning members of his party to keep their focus on Trump rather than on efforts to scrub Confederate monuments. At a news conference Tuesday, Trump said \"both sides\" were to blame for the violence in Virginia and that some \"very fine people\" were among the white-nationalist marchers, who were drawn to Charlottesville by an effort to relocate a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer , D-N.Y., said Trump's tweets Thursday attacking efforts to remove the Confederate statues represented an attempt to \"divert attention away from the President's refusal to unequivocally and full-throatedly denounce white supremacy, neo-Nazism, and other forms of bigotry.\"\n\n\"While it is critical that we work towards the goal of Senator Cory Booker's legislation, we must continue to denounce and resist President Trump for his reprehensible actions,\" he said.\n\nA poll released Thursday showed reasons for Democrats to proceed carefully. A NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll indicated that more Americans are dismayed by Trump's response to the violent march than are supportive of efforts to remove or relocate Confederate monuments.\n\nJust over half of poll respondents said Trump's response to Charlottesville was not strong enough, compared to 27 percent who felt it was sufficient. But 62 percent of respondents said statues of Confederate leaders should remain as historical symbols - including 44 percent of Democrats.\n\nDemocrats have taken aim at Trump: More than 60 House Democrats signed on to a censure resolution floated on Wednesday, and one member, Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., said he would introduce articles of impeachment over Trump's Charlottesville response.\n\nBut Pelosi endorsed only the push to remove the statues Thursday, though she and other top leaders have previously handled the issue with kid gloves.\n\nWhen Pelosi served as speaker, she quietly had the Lee statue moved from Statuary Hall, just off the House chamber, to a less prominent place in the Capitol crypt. But other statues remained in the hall, including that of Alexander Stephens, a Georgian who fiercely defended slavery and famously invoked the \"peculiar institution\" as the basis for the secession of the Confederate states.\n\n\"Our new government,\" he said in 1861, \"is founded upon . . . the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition.\"\n\nAnd in 2015, when the issue of the Confederate statues was last thrust into the spotlight by the murder of nine South Carolina churchgoers at the hands of a white supremacist, top Democrats pushed to remove the Confederate flag from public places but stopped short when it came to the statues.\n\n\"I think that we need to make sure the states understand who they have here,\" said then-Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United

Cory Booker said he would introduce a bill to remove the monuments to white supremacy, a move backed by Rep. Nancy Pelosi.\n\nWhile President Donald Trump spent Thursday morning tweeting about the \"beauty\" of monuments to slavery, at least two politicians are calling to remove them from the U.S. Capitol building.\n\nSenator Cory Booker (D-NJ) tweeted on Wednesday night that he would introduce a bill taking down Confederate statues in the building, though he did not give a specific timeline or indicate when the bill would be brought forward.\n\n\"I will be introducing a bill to remove Confederate statues from the US Capitol building,\" he wrote. \"This is just one step. We have much work to do.\"\n\nI will be introducing a bill to remove Confederate statues from the US Capitol building. This is just one step. We have much work to do.\n\n-- Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) August 17, 2017\n\n\"If Republicans are serious about rejecting white supremacy, I call upon Speaker Ryan to join Democrats to remove the Confederate statues from the Capitol immediately,\" Pelosi said.\n\nBooker's and Pelosi's statements come days after a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, which sprung up in response to the city's plans to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. The violence at the rally -- which ultimately resulted in three deaths, including a woman who was hit with a car by a white supremacist -- has renewed the effort to take down monuments to slavery around the country.\n\nThe president -- who has been slow to condemn the white supremacists in Charlottesville, initially accusing \"many sides\" of escalating the violence -- has maintained support for Confederate monuments, referring to the city's statue of Lee as \"a very, very important statue.\"\n\nThe president doubled down on that rhetoric Thursday morning, speaking out against efforts to take down symbols of the Confederacy.\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nSad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\n\nTrump's tweets seem unlikely to sway the growing calls to remove the monuments across the country. Efforts to remove some Confederate statues were already underway in some areas, including New Orleans, Louisiana, but the tragedy in Charlottesville has spurred swifter action.\n\nIn Baltimore, Maryland, statues were removed quietly in the dead of night on Tuesday, while in Durham, North Carolina activists took matters into their own hands and took a statue down themselves on Monday. Governors in both North Carolina and Virginia have also called for all Confederate monuments in their states to come down. Adding to the growing clamor, New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio announced Wednesday evening that the city will conduct a 90-day review of \"all symbols of hate on city property.\" While it is not immediately clear which symbols will be targeted, some have pointed to plaques and sidewalk markers memorializing Nazi collaborators.\n\nDeBlasio's comments have drawn attention to a truth not often discussed outside of the South: Confederate statues and other monuments to white supremacy dot enclaves all over the United States -- including the U.S. Capitol building, the target of Booker's proposed bill.\n\nIn the National Statuary Hall Collection alone, there are three times as many monuments to the Confederacy as there are of black people in the entirety of the Capitol. The Collection contains 100 statues -- two from each state. While state governments are responsible for the offerings, not a single one has called for a state commemorating a historical black figure. Twelve statues, by contrast, honor people connected to the Confederacy. Both Mississippi and South Carolina are exclusively represented by Confederate figures, with the latter having notably chosen white supremacist paramilitary group member Wade Hampton and the pro-slavery politician John Calhoun.\n\nThat reality doesn't seem to be lost on Booker, who followed up his initial tweet announcing the bill with several links expanding on the history of slave rebellions and uprisings in the South, many of which lack commemorative statues and monuments. Booker also elevated unmarked incidents of white brutality against black people. Sharing one tweet about the 1873 Colfax Massacre, which saw 150 black men murdered by white Southerners, Booker expressed his remorse.\n\nMost do not know of this tragic episode in American history and how it was rewritten by white supremacy. https://t.co/I8b31KKbQH\n\n-- Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) August 17, 2017\n\n\"Most do not know of this tragic episode in American history and how it was rewritten by white supremacy,\" Booker commented.\n\nWhile Booker has Pelosi's support, he is likely to meet resistance elsewhere. A spokesperson for Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) said that the removal of such monuments are \"decisions for those states to make,\" not something Congress can decide. Trump has yet to weigh in on Booker's proposed bill, or on the issue of Confederate monuments in the U.S. Capitol building specifically.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri":

By the way, thank god, they lost,\" CBC Chairman Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-Louisiana, told ABC News in a statement on Monday.\n\nBooker's announcement comes in wake of a violent weekend protest in Charlottesville, Virginia -- which began in protest of the planned removal of a monument of Confederate General Robert E. Lee -- that left one dead and 19 injured after a car-ramming attack. Police arrested James Alex Fields, 20, and charged him with second-degree murder in the incident.\n\nConfederate monuments are being removed around the country under pressure from those who consider them symbols of racism and white supremacy.\n\nFour Confederate-era monuments were removed late Tuesday night and early Wednesday in Baltimore, Maryland, and the governors of Virginia and North Carolina requested the removal of Confederate monuments in their states this week.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, however, has pushed back against the initiatives to remove the memorials, saying the removal of such monuments is \"changing history.\"\n\n\"This week it's Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down. I wonder is it George Washington next week and is it Thomas Jefferson the week after?

Ryan (R-Wis.) indicated that congressional Republicans would not intervene to remove the statues without the states' consent. \"These are decisions for those states to make,\" said the spokesman, Doug Andres.\n\nBut Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said Wednesday he would introduce legislation that would mandate the removal of those statues, saying they \"should not be afforded such a rare honor in this sacred space.\"\n\n\"They are, unequivocally, not only statues of treasonous Americans, but are symbolic to some who seek to revise history and advance hate and division,\" he said.\n\nBooker's proposal comes after other calls for the elimination of Confederate iconography from the Capitol and other federal property. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus, for instance, successfully petitioned last year to have the state flag of Mississippi, which includes the Confederate battle herald, removed from display in a tunnel in the Capitol complex.\n\nSeparate efforts have aimed to remove the display of Confederate flags at federal cemeteries and to rename military posts that carry the names of Confederate generals.\n\nRep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), who has previously led efforts to attach a provision to prevent the display of Confederate flags at federal cemeteries to spending legislation, said Thursday that he anticipated that push would expand to other places under federal purview.\n\nThe deadly violence in Charlottesville \"reminds us how dangerous it is to indulge in revisionist history or euphemisms about what these symbols mean,\" he said. \"There's an interest at looking at all of it, not just the statutes or the military bases, but all of it.\"\n\nBut the top Democrat in the U.S. Senate struck a wary note Thursday, warning members of his party to keep their focus on Trump rather than on efforts to scrub Confederate monuments. At a news conference Tuesday, Trump said \"both sides\" were to blame for the violence in Virginia and that some \"very fine people\" were among the white-nationalist marchers, who were drawn to Charlottesville by an effort to relocate a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\n[Trump mourns loss of 'beautiful statues and monuments' in wake of Charlottesville rally over Robert E. Lee statue]\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Trump's tweets Thursday attacking efforts to remove the Confederate statues represented an attempt to \"divert attention away from the President's refusal to unequivocally and full-throatedly denounce white supremacy, neo-Nazism, and other forms of bigotry.\"\n\n\"While it is critical that we work towards the goal of Senator Cory Booker's legislation, we must continue to denounce and resist President Trump for his reprehensible actions,\" he said.\n\nA poll released Thursday showed reasons for Democrats to proceed carefully. A NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll indicated that more Americans are dismayed by Trump's response to the violent march than are supportive of efforts to remove or relocate Confederate monuments.\n\nJust over half of poll respondents said Trump's response to Charlottesville was not strong enough, compared to 27 percent who felt it was sufficient. But 62 percent of respondents said statues of Confederate leaders should remain as historical symbols -- including 44 percent of Democrats.\n\nDemocrats have taken aim at Trump: More than 60 House Democrats signed on to a censure resolution floated on Wednesday, and one member, Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), said he would introduce articles of impeachment over Trump's Charlottesville response.\n\nBut Pelosi endorsed only the push to remove the statues Thursday, though she and other top leaders have previously handled the issue with kid gloves.\n\nWhen Pelosi served as speaker, she quietly had the Lee statue moved from Statuary Hall, just off the House chamber, to a less prominent place in the Capitol crypt. But other statues remained in the hall, including that of Alexander Stephens, a Georgian who fiercely defended slavery and famously invoked the \"peculiar institution\" as the basis for the secession of the Confederate states.\n\n\"Our new government,\" he said in 1861, \"is founded upon .\u2009.\u2009. the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition.\"\n\nAnd in 2015, when the issue of the Confederate statues was last thrust into the spotlight by the murder of nine South Carolina churchgoers at the hands of a white supremacist, top Democrats pushed to remove the Confederate flag from public places but stopped short when it came to the statues.\n\n\"I think that we need to make sure the states understand who they have here,\" said then-Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.).\n\nKimberly Kindy and Ed O'Keefe contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label":

In all, 100 statues from the 50 states recognizing notable historic figures in their history have been placed in the U.S. Capitol, according to the Architect of the Capitol.\n\nIt was such an effort to remove a Lee statue from a Charlottesville, Va., park that led to Saturday's violent demonstration pitting white supremacists, neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members against opponents of racism and anti-Semitism. One counterprotester was killed.\n\n\"These statues must be moved not just because of who they were in the past, but because of who we are now as a nation and who we must be to ensure an even better and brighter future,\" Booker said.\n\nI will be introducing a bill to remove Confederate statues from the US Capitol building.

Lee.\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" Trump tweeted. \"You can't change history, but you can learn from it.

North Carolina sent a statue of Zebulon Vance to be displayed, Florida sent a statue of Edmund Kirby Smith, the last Confederate general to surrender, Alabama sent a statue of Confederate cavalryman Joseph Wheeler, South Carolina sent a statue of Wade Hampton, Georgia sent a statue of Confederate vice president Alexander Stephens. In 1931, Mississippi chose both Confederate president Jefferson Davis and Confederate colonel James Z. Georg, according to The Washington Post.\n\nPelosi mentioned in her statement that when she was speaker of the house she successfully had Robert E. Lee's relocated to another area in the capitol replacing Lee's statue with a Rosa Parks statue.\n\n\"Under the leadership of Democrats in Congress, we have recognized more women and people of color in Congress's collection of statues, including Rosa Parks, Sojourner Truth and Helen Keller,\" she said. \"As Speaker, we relocated Robert E. Lee out of a place of honor in National Statuary Hall - a place now occupied by the statue of Rosa Parks.\"\n\n\"There is no room for celebrating the violent bigotry of the men of the Confederacy in the hallowed halls of the United States Capitol or in places of honor across the country,\" Pelosi said.\n\nFollow Henry Rodgers On Twitter", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri":

Sherrod Brown has joined a growing number of Democrats in calling to get Confederate statues out of the U.S. Capitol\n\nBrown plans on joining Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., in supporting a bill to remove statues of Confederate politicians and soldiers.\n\n\"Symbols of the confederacy should be removed from taxpayer-funded public property and put in museums where they belong,\" the Ohio Democrat said in a statement.\n\nFor Ohio, the issue had already been decided. The state decided in 2010 to replace a statue of former Ohio Gov. William \"Earthquake\" Allen with inventor Thomas Alva Edison. Allen, the state's governor from 1874 to 1876, never fought in the Civil War, but was an outspoken opponent of President Abraham Lincoln and was sympathetic to slavery.\n\nState leaders gathered votes to determine who should replace Allen, and Edison beat out the likes of the Wright Brothers and Olympic athlete Jesse Owens to become one of 35 statues in Statuary Hall. Allen's statue is now in Chillicothe.\n\nIn all, 100 statues in the Capitol Building -- some are scattered in hallways or in the Capitol Visitors Center -- represent the achievements of the 50 states. Edison is accompanied by former President James A. Garfield in representing Ohio.\n\nBut some of the statues have garnered additional scrutiny in the days since violent protests erupted last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the decision to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee, who led Confederate troops during the Civil War. Lee is one of the statues representing Virginia; it now stands in the crypt of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nA Washington Post analysis of statues in the Capitol found that there are 12 statues of Confederate soldiers and politicians. There are only four of African-Americans: Civil rights pioneers Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks and abolitionists Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth.\n\nLee appeared to discourage memorials to the war and those involved in its aftermath.\n\n\"I think it wiser, moreover, not to keep open the sores of war but to follow the examples of those nations who endeavored to obliterate the marks of civil strife, to commit to oblivion the feelings engendered,\" he wrote in an 1869 letter published in a Virginia newspaper.\n\nBooker, D-N.J., announced late Wednesday he would introduce a bill seeking the removal of the Confederate statues. One day later, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., echoed his call, saying the statues are \"reprehensible.\"\n\n\"The halls of Congress are the very heart of our democracy,\" she said, calling upon Speaker Paul Ryan to remove the Confederate statues \"immediately.\" \"The statues in the Capitol should embody our highest ideals as Americans, expressing who we are and who we aspire to be as a nation.\"\n\nFor his part, President Donald Trump defended the memorials Thursday, tweeting in part, \"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments.

(Alex Pappas/Fox News)\n\nNancy Pelosi and other Democratic lawmakers are ramping up calls to remove Confederate statues on display in the halls of Congress, bringing the raging debate over Civil War symbols across the South to Capitol Hill.\n\nNearly 10 Confederate-era figures are memorialized in the U.S. Capitol, each sponsored by a state. Mississippi displays Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, in Statuary Hall, for example. Virginia displays Gen. Robert E. Lee in the Capitol's crypt.\n\n\"There is no room for celebrating the violent bigotry of the men of the Confederacy in the hallowed halls of the United States Capitol or in places of honor across the country,\" House Minority Leader Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday.\n\nBut even as numerous cities consider taking down monuments in the wake of the Charlottesville violence at a white supremacist rally, the Democrat-led effort on Capitol Hill faces slim chances of success.\n\nThe 100 total statues on display are part of the National Statuary Hall Collection and aren't chosen by Congress. Each state contributes two statues, chosen by their state governments, according to the Architect of the Capitol.\n\n\"These are decisions for those states to make,\" Doug Andres, a spokesman for Speaker Ryan, told Fox News.\n\nOne Democrat suggests he wants to change that.\n\nNew Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker, believed to be mulling a possible run for president in 2020, said Wednesday he plans to introduce a bill to remove the statues from the Capitol building.\n\n\"This is just one step,\" Booker tweeted. \"We have much work to do.\"\n\nOn Thursday, tourists packed into the halls of the Capitol on a hot August afternoon to see the monuments. Standing in Statuary Hall by the Jefferson Davis statue, one Capitol tour guide, wearing the customary red coat, informed one tour group about the latest calls to remove some of the statues.\n\n\"So we will see,\" the guide told the group.\n\nThe tourists who visited the Capitol on Thursday expressed varying opinions about the proposal.\n\n\"They shouldn't be removed. It's part of history, whether you like it or not,\" said Gary Kincaid, 82, of Sedona, Ariz.\n\nOthers said it's time to make a change.\n\n\"It probably shouldn't have been allowed to be put up anyway,\" said Mark Armstrong, 54, an Illinois resident who is retired from the Army.\n\nSpeaking of the Confederates memorialized by the statues, Armstrong, who is black, said: \"I mean, they seceded from the Union. It's being a traitor, basically.\"\n\nAnother tourist outside the Capitol said he didn't feel strongly one way or the other about the issue, but he appreciated both sides of the debate.\n\n\"It's tough to say,\" said Damian, who declined to give his last name. \"It's part of our history, but it's part of our history many people aren't proud of.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz called on her state to remove its statue of Confederate general Edmund Kirby Smith in the Capitol.\n\n\"It's time for Florida lawmakers to call a special session to replace Florida's Confederate statue in our nation's Capitol,\" Wasserman Schultz said.\n\nOther Confederates memorialized in the Capitol include: Alexander Stephens (Georgia), Joseph Wheeler (Alabama), James Z. George (Mississippi), Wade Hampton III (South Carolina), and Zebulon Baird Vance (North Carolina).\n\nAfter the 2015 mass shooting at a black church in Charleston, S.C., Mississippi Democratic Rep. Bennie G. Thompson unsuccessfully pushed legislation to remove Confederate imagery from the Capitol. This week, he renewed his call.\n\n\"Confederate memorabilia have no place in this country and especially not in the United States Capitol,\" Thompson said. \"These images symbolize a time of racial discrimination and segregation that continues to haunt this country and many African-Americans who still to this day face racism and bigotry.\"\n\nPresident Trump on Thursday tweeted his displeasure with the recent push to remove Confederate symbols in cities across the country.\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" Trump said. \"You can't change history, but you can learn from it.\"\n\nThe president argued made a slippery slope argument, asking: \"Who's next, Washington, Jefferson?\"\n\nRICHMOND MAYOR WANTS CONFEDERATE STATUES ON MONUMENT AVENUE REMOVED\n\nThe push has accelerated in recent days after a rally of white supremacists, protesting the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee, turned violent in Charlottesville last weekend. Since then, politicians in a number of states, including Virginia, Kentucky and Maryland have called for the removal of statues.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History",

Just 27 per cent of people said that the monuments should be removed. Pictured above, demonstrators protest for the against Confederate monuments across the country\n\nThe SPLC identified Confederate monuments in 31 states and the District of Columbia, with Virginia, Georgia and North Carolina having the most - at 96, 90 and 90, respectively\n\nThese are the locations as of Thursday where a Confederate monument has either been removed or there has been a proposal to remove the monument\n\nAnd, in a striking breakdown, 44 per cent of African Americans agreed the statues should stay, against 40 percent who said they should be removed.\n\nLocated mostly in the southeastern United States, there are some 1,500 symbols of the pro-slavery Confederacy which fought and lost a war to secede from 1861-65.\n\nAn estimated 750,000 people, or more than two percent of the US population at the time, were killed in the conflict.\n\nThe monuments, as well as the names of many roads, schools, and public buildings, mostly celebrate Lee, the leader of the Confederate forces; Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy; and General Thomas 'Stonewall' Jackson, one of Lee's top commanders.\n\nIn the poll of 1,125 people nationwide, Republicans overwhelmingly supported keeping the statues in place, with only six per cent in favor of removing them.\n\nBut Democrats were almost evenly divided: 47 per cent favored pulling them down, while 44 per cent support leaving them in place for history's sake.\n\nThe poll appeared to lend support to Trump's controversial stance on the issue.\n\nMoves to remove statues honoring leaders of the Confederacy have gained momentum since the Charlottesville violence with monuments coming down in Baltimore and other cities.\n\nA statue of Jefferson Davis, second from left, president of the Confederate States from 1861 to 1865, is on display in Statuary Hall on Capitol Hill in Washington. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is calling for the removal of Confederate statues from the US Capitol as the contentious debate over the appropriateness of such memorials moves to the halls of Congress\n\nSince Monday, officials in Baltimore and Gainesville, Florida, have taken down statues while another was torn from its plinth by protesters in Durham, North Carolina. Calls for more to be removed have grown louder.\n\nThis has created an additional headache for cities and spurred another debate: how to dispose of the statues once they are taken down.\n\nSome have suggested museums, others putting them in Confederate cemeteries and one city councilman proposed using their metal to make likenesses of civil rights leaders.\n\n'Melting them down and using the materials to make monuments for Frederick Douglass, Thurgood Marshall, Harriet Tubman would be powerful!' Baltimore city councilman Brandon Scott wrote on Twitter this week. The mayor's office said that was unlikely.\n\nThe debate contrasts sharply with how Eastern Europe handled thousands of statues following the collapse of Communism in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nOften pulled down by angry mobs, some of the statues ended up in dumpsters and others in museums to teach people the evils of totalitarian regimes.\n\nIn Budapest, a for-profit park hosts about 40 statues of communist heroes such as Karl Marx.\n\nA monument dedicated to soldiers of the Confederate States of America stands at Santa Ana Cemetery, in Santa Ana, California\n\nIn the US South, the debate still rages between those nostalgic for the past and those who view the monuments as painful reminders of slavery.\n\nThere are more than 700 Confederate statues in the United States according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, most of them created in the 1910s and 1920s, decades after the Civil War ended.\n\nThey were intended to reassert the power of white people, said Jonathan Leib, Chair of Political Science and Geography at Old Dominion University in Virginia.\n\nIn Birmingham, Alabama, Mayor William Bell ordered workers to hide a Confederate statue behind plywood boards, while the city challenges a state law banning the removal of such monuments.\n\nBut sympathies persist, as both lawmakers and citizens resist plans to remove them.\n\n'I absolutely disagree with this sanitization of history,' Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin, a Republican, told WVHU radio on Tuesday.\n\nFor now, many of the removed statues gather dust in warehouses or, as in the case of New Orleans, sit disassembled in a city scrap yard, where two were found by local reporters.\n\nIn Baltimore, statues are now in storage, according to the mayor's spokesman Anthony McCarthy, who said they will likely end up in a Confederate cemetery or a museum.\n\nA statue of Confederate Gen Thomas 'Stonewall' Jackson in Charleston, W. Va. Most of the 11 Southern states that seceded prior to and during the Civil War have rebel monuments on or near the grounds of their state Capitol buildings\n\nMany city legislators have expressed interest in relocating statues to museums, where they might be viewed as historical artifacts and not rallying points for racism.\n\nAnna Lopez Brosche, city council president in Jacksonville, Florida, encouraged the removal of Confederate statues from public property on Monday and proposed placing them where they will be 'historically contextualized.'\n\nIn Lexington, Kentucky, Mayor Jim Gray has proposed removing statues from one city park, formerly the site of a slave auction block and whipping post.\n\nMeanwhile, a statue removed in Gainesville, Florida, on Monday is being returned to a local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, which erected it in 1904.\n\nThe group, founded in 1894 by women descended from Confederate soldiers, put up many of the statues as part of their goal to display what they call 'a truthful history' of the Civil War and mark places 'made historic by Confederate valor'.\n\nTrump, echoing remarks he first made earlier this week, made it clear on Thursday that he opposed the campaign to remove statues.\n\n'Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,' Trump said.\n\nEmployees work to relocate the Confederate monument, known by locals as Old Joe, near the corner of West University Avenue and South Main Street in Gainesville, Florida, on Monday\n\n'You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!' he said.\n\n'Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!' he said.\n\nLee and Thomas 'Stonewall' Jackson were Confederate generals while George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were among the Founding Fathers of the United States.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center last year identified more than 1,500 symbols of the Confederacy in public spaces, though some have been removed in recent days and weeks.\n\nThey include monuments and statues, flags, named schools and public works, many in honor of key figures such as Stonewall Jackson, Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis - while others memorialize lesser-known cult figures or an anonymous soldier meant to symbolize the average Confederate fighter.\n\nThe SPLC found 718 monuments and statues; 109 public schools named for Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis or other Confederate icons; 80 counties and cities named for Confederates; and 10 US military bases named for Confederates.\n\nA protester kicks the toppled statue of a Confederate soldier after it was pulled down in Durham, North Carolina, on Monday\n\nThe report highlighted Virginia, Georgia and North Carolina as having far more monuments than others, with 96, 90 and 90, respectively.\n\nOf the eight other states that seceded from the Union, Alabama had 48, Arkansas had 36, Florida had 25, Louisiana had 37, Mississippi had 48, South Carolina had 50, Tennessee had 43, and Texas had 66.\n\nThe center reported monuments in a total of 31 states and the District of Columbia. Most were located in the South, though states further afield such as Arizona, and even Massachusetts, harbored monuments - hosting two and one, respectively.\n\nWhile the dedication of monuments peaked, according to the SPLC, in the early and mid-1900s, the organization's research shows that - like in St. Cloud - monuments were still being erected well into the 21st century, and not only in the South.\n\nConfederate memorials were erected in Iowa in 2005 and 2007; Oklahoma in 2004; Delaware in 2007; and Florida in 2007 and 2009.\n\nMissouri also erected a statue of a Confederate general in 2009, a development celebrated by Confederate enthusiasts in neighboring Kentucky, as well.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 100, "id": 285, "label":

Amy Newman/Northjersey.com\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nPresident Donald Trump used a series of tweets Thursday to defend Confederate statues, hours after Sen. Cory Booker used his own Twitter feed to announce legislation to have them removed from the Capitol.\n\nTrump's tweets appeared to be aimed at decisions by cities such as Charlottesville, Va., and Baltimore to remove statues and monuments connected with Civil War generals and other figures.\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our country being ripped apart,\" Trump said, predicting \"the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed.\"\n\nSad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You..... -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nHe also warned that if statues of Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson were removed, tributes to Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who were slave owners, could be next.\n\nTrump made similar comments on Tuesday during a news conference in which he said \"both sides\" shared blame for violence that happened in Charlottesville on Saturday after a \"Unite the Right\" rally was held to protest the removal of statue of Lee.\n\nI will be introducing a bill to remove Confederate statues from the US Capitol building. This is just one step. We have much work to do. -- Cory Booker (@CoryBooker)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nBooker's legislation could move the debate from city halls to the Capitol when Democrats return to Washington after Labor Day.\n\nDemocrats are in the minority in both chambers, so senators like Booker, of Newark, would have little leverage to force action on the bill.\n\nBut Congress has a heavy agenda this fall and will likely need Democratic support to get some bills to Trump's desk, including measures to raise the debt ceiling and keep the government operating beyond the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year.\n\nIn Statuary Hall, the room near the House chamber where each state has the power to place two statues, there are twelve of people who fought for the Confederacy or were active in Confederate politics, according to the Washington Post.\n\nStates have the authority under federal law to choose two statues to represent them in the Capitol. New Jersey's two statues are of Richard Stockton, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and Philip Kearny, a general for the North in the Civil War.\n\nUnder current law, a state official such as a governor would have to make a request to replace a statue.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: https://njersy.co/2x7pRLe", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories":

So foolish!\"\n\n\"The beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\" he continued.\n\nThe president's tweets came amid criticism Trump has received over his response to the Charlottesville, Va., attack last weekend.\n\nDuring a press conference on Tuesday, Trump defended his initial responsethat \"many sides\" were responsible for violence that resulted from protests and counter-protests in Charlottesville -- clashes sparked by the removal of a Confederate statue there, and which resulted in the death of 32-year-old counter-protester Heather Heyer.\n\nPoliticians from both parties reacted differently.\n\nMaine Gov. Paul LePage, an outspoken conservative, hailed Trump's stance. He condemned the Ku Klux Klan, members of which were in attendance in Charlottesville, but said counter-protesters who incited violence were \"equally as bad.\"\n\nHe also likened the removal of Confederate statues to taking down monuments honoring victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n\n\"Whether we like it or not this is what our history is and to me it's just like going to New York City right now and taking down the monument of those who perished in 9/11,\" LePage told WGAN radio during a weekly interview. \"It will come to that.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., though, called on House Speaker Paul Ryan to remove all Confederate monuments from the grounds of the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"The Confederate statues in the halls of Congress have always been reprehensible,\" Pelosi said in a statement. \"If Republicans are serious about rejecting white supremacy, I call upon Speaker Ryan to join Democrats to remove the Confederate statues from the Capitol immediately.\"\n\nPelosi pointed out that when Democrats were in control of Congress, they moved a statue of Lee, the Confederate general, out of Statuary Hall in the Capitol and replaced it with one of civil rights activist Rosa Parks.\n\nAt the local level, cities have grappled with how to handle Confederate statues that have the potential to become flash points for racial animus. The city of Baltimore removed multiple Confederate monuments in the early morning hours Wednesday with no warning.\n\nThe fallout from Trump's press conference includes the dismantling of two of his advisory boards -- the American Manufacturing Council and the Strategic and Policy Forum.\n\n\"Racism and murder are unequivocally reprehensible and are not morally equivalent to anything else that happened in Charlottesville,\" Campbell Soup President and CEO Denise Morrison wrote after she left the manufacturing council Wednesday. \"Following [Tuesday's] remarks from the president, I cannot remain on the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative. I will continue to support all efforts to spur economic growth and advocate for the values that have always made America great.\"", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri":

Trump said removing the statues of Confederate generals meant removing \"beauty\" -- that would \"never able to be comparably replaced\" -- from American cities. As he did in a Tuesday press conference, he also attempted to equate some Confederate generals with some of the Founding Fathers.\n\nStrung together, the tweets read:\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\" [ellipses removed for clarity]\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters declined to discuss the tweets with reporters on Thursday morning, saying, \"The tweets speak for themselves.\"\n\nThe online postings come after days of the president whipsawing back and forth on his response to the violence in Charlottesville, Va., that led to the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer after a man who had attended the white supremacist rally drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters.\n\nShortly after that incident, Trump condemned both the white nationalist protesters and the counterprotesters, saying there was an \"egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides.\"\n\nAfter Democrats and Republicans alike castigated him for those remarks, the president came out more forcefully against racist groups on Monday, declaring that \"racism is evil\" and characterizing members of the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis as \"criminals and thugs.\"\n\nBut Trump's impromptu remarks at a Tuesday press conference -- originally intended to focus on infrastructure -- represented a strong swing back to his original position, which suggested equivalency between white supremacist groups and the \"alt-right,\" on the one hand, and the groups who opposed them like Black Lives Matter and leftist anti-fascist protesters, on the other hand.\n\nLeadership from both parties in the House of Representatives also joined the growing debate over Confederate statues.\n\nMinority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Thursday for Confederate statues to be removed from the halls of the Capitol building.\n\n\"If Republicans are serious about rejecting white supremacy, I call upon Speaker Ryan to join Democrats to remove the Confederate statues from the Capitol immediately,\" the California Democrat said, in a statement. \"There is no room for celebrating the violent bigotry of the men of the Confederacy in the hallowed halls of the United States Capitol or in places of honor across the country.\"\n\nThe people portrayed in the statues in question are selected by the states. Each state government gets to pick two statues.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., said the decision to rid the Capitol of Confederate heroes would be a decision \"for those states to make,\" according to a statement from his spokesman provided to Bloomberg.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has sometimes been a critic of the president, said in a series of tweets Thursday that Trump needs to act in a manner that doesn't garner praise from racist and hate-filled groups.\n\n\"History is watching us all,\" Graham said, responding to a dig Trump had made at him on Twitter Thursday morning.\n\nPolitical journalist Ryan Lizza was even more pointed in his reaction, tweeting that Trump had effectively made himself the chief executive of \"the Confederate States of America.\"\n\nAround half of Americans -- 52 percent -- believe the president's response to the violence in Charlottesville was \"not strong enough,\" according to an NPR/Marist poll released Wednesday. Only 27 percent said it was strong enough (the remainder were unsure).\n\nThose views shift heavily by party -- a majority of Republicans, 59 percent, say the president's response was strong enough (compared with 10 percent of Democrats). Meanwhile, an overwhelming majority of Democrats -- 79 percent -- believe the response was not strong enough (compared with 19 percent of Republicans).\n\nHowever, more than 60 percent of Americans also believe that statues honoring the Confederacy should \"remain as a historical symbol,\" according to that NPR/Marist poll. And while there is also a partisan divide here, a sizable share of Democrats, 44 percent, believe those statues should remain (along with 86 percent of Republicans and 61 percent of independents).\n\nDebate over removal of Confederate memorials has spread nationwide in recent years, and especially in recent days.\n\nOfficials in Lexington, Ky., are bracing for protests as that city moves forward in the process to remove two Confederate statues from its old courthouse. The mayor of Baltimore, Md., had three statues removed hastily, in the dead of night, earlier this week. And in Durham, N.C., a group of demonstrators took matters into their own hands to remove a Confederate memorial.\n\nIn Alabama, the state Attorney General's Office has filed a lawsuit against the city of Birmingham and Mayor William Bell for covering a Confederate monument in a park.\n\nWhile defenders say that such memorials simply represent a part of the nation's history, the monuments and statues are for many Americans a reminder of the nation's painful history of slavery and the people who fought to defend it.\n\nIn a widely circulated May speech on his city's removal of four statues commemorating the Confederacy, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, a Democrat, explained why he believed that removing the memorials was necessary.\n\n\"These statues are not just stone and metal,\" he said. \"They are not just innocent remembrances of a benign history. These monuments purposefully celebrate a fictional, sanitized Confederacy; ignoring the death, ignoring the enslavement, and the terror that it actually stood for.\"", "date": "2017-08-17",

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) will introduce legislation after Congress reconvenes next month calling for the removal of at least a dozen statues of Confederate soldiers and politicians located inside the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe move follows similar action by many city officials around the country who are considering removal of Confederate statues and other memorials in an effort to avoid the kind of unrest that occurred in Charlottesville as alt-right and white nationalist groups across the country vow to stage more rallies.\n\nBooker made the announcement Wednesday night on Twitter, saying, \"This is just one step.

We have much work to do.\n\n-- Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) August 17, 2017\n\nThe monuments include statues of Robert E. Lee, Edward Douglass White and Joseph Wheeler, which are part of the Capitol's National Statuary Hall Collection. There are a dozen statues of Confederate soldiers and politicians in that collection alone, compared to just four of black leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. that are sprinkled throughout the entire complex, according to the Architect of the Capitol.\n\nProtests over Confederate symbols have erupted in several cities, following white nationalist violence in Charlottesville on Aug. 12. (Amber Ferguson/The Washington Post)\n\nAt the local level, city and civil leaders are concerned the presence of Confederate monuments might make their cities a flash point for future demonstrations by white nationalist groups. That fear prompted the city of Baltimore to remove four Confederate monuments in the darkness early Wednesday morning.\n\n[Mayors taking swift action to avoid becoming the next Charlottesville]\n\nHours after the monuments' removal, more than 1,000 people gathered at a memorial service for Heather Heyer in Charlottesville, who was killed last week when a car allegedly driven by a Nazi sympathizer plowed into a crowd of counterprotesters at a white supremacist rally at the University of Virginia.

Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\"\n\n\"The beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\" he continued.\n\nThe president's tweets came amid criticism Trump has received over his response to the Charlottesville, Va., attack last weekend.\n\nDuring a press conference on Tuesday, Trump defended his initial response that \"many sides\" were responsible for violence that resulted from protests and counter-protests in Charlottesville -- clashes sparked by the removal of a Confederate statue there, and which resulted in the death of 32-year-old counter-protester Heather Heyer.\n\nPoliticians from both parties reacted differently.\n\nMaine Gov. Paul LePage, an outspoken conservative, hailed Trump's stance. He condemned the Ku Klux Klan, members of which were in attendance in Charlottesville, but said counter-protesters who incited violence were \"equally as bad.\"\n\nHe also likened the removal of Confederate statues to taking down monuments honoring victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n\n\"Whether we like it or not this is what our history is and to me it's just like going to New York City right now and taking down the monument of those who perished in 9/11,\" LePage told WGAN radio during a weekly interview. \"It will come to that.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., though, called on House Speaker Paul Ryan to remove all Confederate monuments from the grounds of the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"The Confederate statues in the halls of Congress have always been reprehensible,\" Pelosi said in a statement. \"If Republicans are serious about rejecting white supremacy, I call upon Speaker Ryan to join Democrats to remove the Confederate statues from the Capitol immediately.\"\n\nPelosi pointed out that when Democrats were in control of Congress, they moved a statue of Lee, the Confederate general, out of Statuary Hall in the Capitol and replaced it with one of civil rights activist Rosa Parks.\n\nAt the local level, cities have grappled with how to handle Confederate statues that have the potential to become flash points for racial animus. The city of Baltimore removed multiple Confederate monuments in the early morning hours Wednesday with no warning.\n\nThe fallout from Trump's press conference includes the dismantling of two of his advisory boards -- the American Manufacturing Council and the Strategic and Policy Forum.\n\n\"Racism and murder are unequivocally reprehensible and are not morally equivalent to anything else that happened in Charlottesville,\" Campbell Soup President and CEO Denise Morrison wrote after she left the manufacturing council Wednesday. \"Following [Tuesday's] remarks from the president, I cannot remain on the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative. I will continue to support all efforts to spur economic growth and advocate for the values that have always made America great.\"", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues",

Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said he plans to craft legislation that would remove the Capitol's statues lionizing supporters of the slave-holding era.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBooker is among only a few Democrats publicly calling for the figures' removal after white supremacists staged a violent rally in Charlottesville over that city's Robert E. Lee statue, but his bill promises to reopen an emotional debate that presents pitfalls for both parties.\n\nIn the wake of the Charlottesville rally, which left one woman dead and more than a dozen injured, Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D-Va.) and the Democratic nominee in November's election to replace him, Ralph Northam, have both come out in favor of replacing the state's Confederate monuments.\n\nThe issue is more complicated for members of Congress, however, thanks to longstanding guidelines that empower state legislatures to select the statues in the Capitol that honor prominent citizens from their states.\n\nEven so, Congress could eliminate all Confederate statues via legislation and Booker said Wednesday night that he would propose that move. \"This is just one step,\" Booker tweeted. \"We have much work to do.\"\n\nThere are 10 statues in the Capitol's National Statuary Hall Collection honoring individuals who served in the Confederate army or government. Others depict supporters of slavery or the Confederacy, such as former Secretary of State and Sen. John C. Calhoun and Uriah Milton Rose of Arkansas.\n\nLeaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus are also backing removal of the Capitol's Confederate statues, though a spokeswoman for the Congressional Black Caucus said Tuesday the group is not presently proposing any legislative solution because GOP leaders have supported leaving the decisions to individual states. A spokesman for Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) affirmed that stance earlier this week, POLITICO reported.\n\nCongressional Democratic leaders have yet to publicly weigh in on Booker's forthcoming legislation, which promises to put Virginia Democratic Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine in the spotlight given the sensitivity of the issue in their state.\n\nWarner said Thursday that he and Booker are talking \"about how we might move forward on\" the Confederate statues housed within Congress.\n\n\"[T]his is a conversation that is going to, I think, go on now for some time, but I think that everybody needs to have a chance to be heard,\" Warner told a radio station in Richmond. The former Virginia governor also noted that \"there's going to have to be a local process in every community, and we're going to have to have tough, and in many ways overdue conversations, about race.\"\n\nWhile serving as Richmond mayor in the 1990s, Kaine spearheaded the installation of a statue commemorating African-American tennis champion Arthur Ashe and released an official apology for the city's participation in slavery -- but he also has supported local conversations about potential monument removal.\n\n\"Senator Kaine thinks Senator Booker's proposal is a good idea, and he plans to work with him on the bill and support it,\" a Kaine spokesperson said Thursday. \"He also believes the Senate needs to work to address the fundamental inequities in our society that have left African Americans and families of color in this country with far less wealth, higher unemployment rates, fewer opportunities and less protection under the law.\"\n\nConfederate statue removal may also prove an easier cause to champion for congressional Democratic leaders. During her time as Speaker, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) orchestrated the movement of Lee's likeness from Statuary Hall near the Capitol rotunda to a less prominent spot on the first floor of the building.\n\nDemocrats are also facing a growing push from civil rights groups and outside-the-Beltway activists to take a stronger stand on the remaining statues in the Capitol as cities from Baltimore to Jacksonville take on removal of their Confederate monuments.\n\n\"This is a moment for members of Congress to come together to show that they are not complicit with those who sow hate and division,\" Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said in a statement. \"One way to show they do not support white nationalists would be to take a serious look at symbols of hate and monuments to racial discrimination that are enshrined in our nation's Capitol.\"\n\nIn addition, Trump's alignment with supporters of maintaining the Confederate iconography could influence Democratic decision-making. Trump's call on Thursday to maintain Confederate monuments, comparing Lee and Stonewall Jackson to the Founding Fathers, mark an escalation from remarks earlier this week in which he said the issue should be discussed on a case-by-case basis.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri":

Lee statue", "uri": "711171060", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-17T23:57:00Z", "time": "23:57:00", "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Thursday mourned the loss of \"beautiful statues and monuments\" in the wake of the violent clashes in Charlottesville during a white supremacist demonstration protesting the planned removal of a statue depicting Confederate military commander Robert E. Lee.\n\nTrump tweeted: \"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You.....\n\n\"...can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also...\n\n\"...the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nTrump's string of morning tweets made clear the president was not willing to back down over his claims Tuesday that some of the demonstrators had legitimate grievances over the loss of Southern \"history,\" and that \"both sides\" were to blame in the mayhem that left a woman dead and at least 19 more injured. Trump made those claims a day after he had belatedly condemned the neo-Nazi and Klux Klan groups that organized the Unite the Right rally. Politicians from both parties have criticized the president for inflaming racial tensions and failing to provide clear moral leadership for the nation.\n\nSome white supremacist leaders, including David Duke, the former KKK grand wizard, have praised Trump for his \"honesty\" and \"courage.\"\n\nDuring his remarks Tuesday and again in his tweets Thursday, Trump argued that Lee and fellow Confederate general Stonewall Jackson, who commanded Southern forces in the Civil War to secede from the United States, are important and admired historical figures in the South. He said they could be equated to Founding Fathers George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who owned slaves and thus could potentially be subject to a modern-day backlash that would tarnish their legacies.\n\nThe political backlash to Trump's handling of the situation has left some White House advisers dispirited. But the president appears to have been emboldened to fight back against his critics and create a cultural wedge issue over the matter that could rally his base of hard-core supporters.\n\nTrump's chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, said in interviews this week that he relishes a fight with Democrats over cultural issues because it will allow the president to \"crush\" his rivals by focusing on the economy.\n\n\"The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em,\" Bannon told the American Prospect. \"I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\"\n\nThere is little polling of public opinion over what to do with Confederate monuments. An NPR/PBS survey conducted on Monday and Tuesday by Marist College found that 62 percent said statues honoring Confederate leaders should remain as a historical symbol; 27 percent said they should be removed because they are offensive to some people.\n\nThat poll found a large political divide: Republicans prefer to keep statues by 86 percent to 6 percent, while Democrats split 44 percent for keeping them and 47 percent for removing them. African Americans in the survey were roughly split on the question (44 percent keep, 40 percent remove).\n\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., announced late Wednesday that he intends to introduce legislation after Congress reconvenes next month calling for the removal of at least a dozen statues of Confederate soldiers and politicians located inside the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe move follows similar action by many city officials around the country who are considering removal of Confederate statues and other memorials in an effort to avoid the kind of unrest that occurred in Charlottesville as alt-right and white nationalist groups across the country vow to stage more rallies.\n\nBooker made the announcement on Twitter, writing: \"This is just one step. We have much work to do.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., issued a statement calling on Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to join Democrats in efforts to remove Confederate statues from the halls of the Capitol. Those statues are generally selected by individual states to represent them.\n\n\"The statues in the Capitol should embody our highest ideals as Americans, expressing who we are and who we aspire to be as a nation,\" Pelosi said. \"The Confederate statues in the halls of Congress have always been reprehensible.\"\n\nBannon, who ran the conservative, \"alt-right\" Breitbart News operation before joining Trump's campaign, has been at odds with other top White House advisers and grown increasingly isolated. Asked if he still had confidence in Bannon during a news conference Tuesday, Trump called him a \"good man\" and said he was not a racist. \"We'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon,\" Trump said.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times, Bannon defended Trump's comparison between the Confederate generals and the Founding Fathers, saying it \"connects with the American people about their history, culture and traditions.\n\n\"The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,\" Bannon added. \"Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it.\"\n\nTrump is at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, on the second week of a working vacation. Aides said he will meet with Gov. Rick Scott, R-Fla., and with Linda McMahon, head of the Small Business Administration. McMahon will provide the president an update on the agency's tax reform and deregulation initiative.\n\nTrump has not yet spoken to the mayor of Charlottesville or Heyer's parents. The president is scheduled to spend Friday at Camp David with senior aides to discuss the administration's policy toward South Asia.\n\nCharlottesville wasn't the first place that white supremacists had gathered to protest the removal of a Confederate statute. They have been doing this in several cities, including once before in Charlottesville, but this was the first one that erupted in mayhem and deadly violence. More rallies are planned for other cities as a show of force to pressure municipal officials into not removing the Civil War-era symbols.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump said he agreed with the decision in 2015 by then-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to remove a Confederate flag from the state house grounds following the mass shooting by Dylann Roof, a white supremacist who killed nine African Americans at a black church.\n\n\"I would take it down, yes,\" Trump said at the time. Haley is now serving as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. \"I think they should put it in a museum and respect whatever it is you have to respect.\"\n\nBut Confederate flags increasingly appeared at Trump's rallies and were often sold by unaffiliated vendors outside his rally venues. On Saturday, in his first response to the Charlottesville violence, Trump blamed the actions coming from \"many sides\" and added: \"We must love each other, respect each other and cherish our history and our future together. So important.\"\n\nSome white supremacists interpreted that comment as proof that they are right in protesting, and Trump went further on Tuesday by saying many of the demonstrators were not white supremacists and that there were \"fine people\" among them.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100, "id": 276, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics"}, {"uri":

Lee statue from a public park as a reason to march in the city. The matter is still pending in court, but instead of letting that peaceful process play out, the white nationalist groups descended on the city and that naturally attracted anti-white supremacist groups to confront them. Sadly, several violent and ugly incidents ensued, topped off by the killing of 32-year-old Heather Heyer.\n\nHeyer's death and the injuries that took place in Charlottesville should have provided clarity about how we resolve controversies like how to deal with controversial monuments in a civil and democratic society.\n\nBut so far, everyone seems to be getting it wrong.\n\nFirst off, President Trump is wrong to focus on how it would be unjust to take down statues of Lee or Jackson and then also say that monuments to Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson could be next. Whether the statues are beautiful and even whether Washington and Jefferson would be \"next\" is not the issue.\n\nThe issue is whether the decision to remove municipal property is done with due process and certainly not via the actions of a violent mob. Even if President Trump is right that some groups calling for removing Confederate statues would also support removing monuments to slaveholders like Washington and Jefferson, his job is to remind everyone to follow the law.\n\nThat way, if people in a mob decide to next topple statues of Washington, Jefferson, or Yogi Bear, they'll be reminded that doing so is illegal. Instead his comments about the statues Tuesday and his tweets on Thursday were those of an all-too-invested proponent of the statues and what they may or may not stand for.\n\nJust in case the president or anyone else needs a history lesson, remember that George Washington and Thomas Jefferson are simply on a much higher plain by any standard than Generals Lee and Stonewall Jackson. It doesn't mean they were evil men, and in fact Lee worked hard to promote Southern acceptance of peaceful American reunification.\n\nBut let's be frank, the statues to people like Lee and Jackson adorned in their Confederate uniforms were not erected to mark their contributions as peacemakers. Many were built in the 1950s and 60s as a form of defiance against the Civil Rights movement. That's a big reason why the president's bully pulpit shouldn't be used to defend the statues, but to defend the legal process for removing or keeping them.\n\nRep. Pelosi also misses the mark by grandstanding the issue with her public release. As a former Speaker of the House and someone who has been in Congress for more than 30 years, Pelosi knows, (or should know), that the statues in the Capitol's National Statuary Hall Collection are placed there by individual states who each get to choose two people they want to honor.\n\nNeither current Speaker Paul Ryan, nor any other official not from those states, has the authority to remove them unilaterally. And as reprehensible as the Confederacy was for seceding from the U.S. mostly to defend the barbaric institution of slavery, responding to that historic barbarism with a public call to remove statues to score political points cheapens the legacy of all who fought to end slavery and crush the Confederacy in the first place.\n\nBesides, why didn't Pelosi et al initiate a move to remove the statues when she was Speaker of the House from 2007-2011?\n\nRead More\n\nThere's a similar argument making the rounds on social media and other places about \"whether it's okay to punch Nazis.\" The saddest part of that conversation is that it's predicated on the complete disregard for the fact that physically attacking someone who isn't physically attacking or legitimately threatening you physically is against the law in America and every other civilized place in the world.\n\nMaking it okay to punch someone, even someone wearing horrific Nazi symbols and goosestepping across a public street, basically endorses just the kind of behavior the actual Nazis used to come to power in the 1930s.\n\nIt's more and more clear that we shouldn't want to continue to honor Confederate leaders in today's America. And it's ludicrous to compare them to the true Founding Fathers. But we can't trash the democratic process to make these kinds of cosmetic changes. It's a pity both President Trump and Rep. Pelosi have chosen to ignore everything but rhetorical arguments about what statues stand for instead of doing their jobs to uphold the law.\n\nCommentary by Jake Novak, CNBC.com senior columnist.

In other places, protesters called for the removal of local statues, and in Durham, North Carolina, protesters removed a statue of a Confederate soldier themselves. Meanwhile, Sen. Corey Booker, D- New Jersey, announced he plans to introduce legislation to remove Confederate statues from the U.S. Capitol. But President Trump is not on board.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Thursday morning, Trump decried the removal of Confederate statues as the country's history being \"ripped apart.\"\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he wrote. \"You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nMany on Twitter have pointed out that removing statues dedicated to an era in which slavery and oppression were the norm, and upholding those who fought to keep that the status quo, isn't erasing or changing history -- it's choosing not to celebrate those parts through a memorial. Some also said that continuing to have statues dedicated to the Confederacy is a painful reminder of white supremacy, and keeping them in place continues that legacy.\n\nOn CNN, Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery likened Confederate statues to if we memorialized terrorists.\n\n\"The President of the United States believes there should be statues across this nation, honoring people who fought, and in some cases died, to keep American citizens, some people who live here, in chains,\" he said. \"The President of the unites States believes the should honor in public places people who think that black and brown Americans, and in some cases Jewish Americans, are subhuman.\"\n\n\"There's been a conversation that we've had in political spaces where we like to 'both sides' this story. Is it erasing history, is this not. No,\" Lowery continued. \"In our nation, we don't have statues of terrorists all over the place in other contexts.\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Eugene_Scott/status/898181788312363010\n\nOthers have drawn comparisons between the U.S. having Confederate statues and the idea of Germany keeping statues of Hitler.\n\nActivist and college student Takiyah Thompson, who was arrested for inciting a riot after she helped protesters remove a Confederate statue in Durham, told Democracy Now, statues to the Confederacy are symbols of white nationalism.\n\n\"I decided to climb to the top of the Confederate soldiers statue and put the rope around its neck and throw the rope down to the crowd. And the crowd could decide if they wanted to pull it down or not. And I did this because the statue is a symbol of nationalism, and it's a symbol of white nationalism.

Lee statue from a public park as a reason to march in the city. The matter is still pending in court, but instead of letting that peaceful process play out, the white nationalist groups descended on the city and that naturally attracted anti-white supremacist groups to confront them. Sadly, several violent and ugly incidents ensued, topped off by the killing of 32-year-old Heather Heyer.\n\nHeyer's death and the injuries that took place in Charlottesville should have provided clarity about how we resolve controversies like how to deal with controversial monuments in a civil and democratic society.\n\nBut so far, everyone seems to be getting it wrong.\n\nFirst off, President Trump is wrong to focus on how it would be unjust to take down statues of Lee or Jackson and then also say that monuments to Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson could be next. Whether the statues are beautiful and even whether Washington and Jefferson would be \"next\" is not the issue.\n\nThe issue is whether the decision to remove municipal property is done with due process and certainly not via the actions of a violent mob. Even if President Trump is right that some groups calling for removing Confederate statues would also support removing monuments to slaveholders like Washington and Jefferson, his job is to remind everyone to follow the law.\n\nThat way, if people in a mob decide to next topple statues of Washington, Jefferson, or Yogi Bear, they'll be reminded that doing so is illegal. Instead his comments about the statues Tuesday and his tweets on Thursday were those of an all-too-invested proponent of the statues and what they may or may not stand for.\n\nJust in case the president or anyone else needs a history lesson, remember that George Washington and Thomas Jefferson are simply on a much higher plain by any standard than Generals Lee and Stonewall Jackson. It doesn't mean they were evil men, and in fact Lee worked hard to promote Southern acceptance of peaceful American reunification.\n\nBut let's be frank, the statues to people like Lee and Jackson adorned in their Confederate uniforms were not erected to mark their contributions as peacemakers. Many were built in the 1950s and 60s as a form of defiance against the Civil Rights movement. That's a big reason why the president's bully pulpit shouldn't be used to defend the statues, but to defend the legal process for removing or keeping them.\n\nRep. Pelosi also misses the mark by grandstanding the issue with her public release. As a former Speaker of the House and someone who has been in Congress for more than 30 years, Pelosi knows, (or should know), that the statues in the Capitol's National Statuary Hall Collection are placed there by individual states who each get to choose two people they want to honor.\n\nNeither current Speaker Paul Ryan, nor any other official not from those states, has the authority to remove them unilaterally. And as reprehensible as the Confederacy was for seceding from the U.S. mostly to defend the barbaric institution of slavery, responding to that historic barbarism with a public call to remove statues to score political points cheapens the legacy of all who fought to end slavery and crush the Confederacy in the first place.\n\nBesides, why didn't Pelosi et al initiate a move to remove the statues when she was Speaker of the House from 2007-2011?\n\nThere's a similar argument making the rounds on social media and other places about \"whether it's okay to punch Nazis.\" The saddest part of that conversation is that it's predicated on the complete disregard for the fact that physically attacking someone who isn't physically attacking or legitimately threatening you physically is against the law in America and every other civilized place in the world.\n\nMaking it okay to punch someone, even someone wearing horrific Nazi symbols and goosestepping across a public street, basically endorses just the kind of behavior the actual Nazis used to come to power in the 1930s.\n\nIt's more and more clear that we shouldn't want to continue to honor Confederate leaders in today's America. And it's ludicrous to compare them to the true Founding Fathers. But we can't trash the democratic process to make these kinds of cosmetic changes. It's a pity both President Trump and Rep. Pelosi have chosen to ignore everything but rhetorical arguments about what statues stand for instead of doing their jobs to uphold the law.\n\nCommentary by Jake Novak, CNBC.com senior columnist.

The statue describes him as \"STATESMAN -- AUTHOR -- PATRIOT.\" The inscription offers his credo: \"I am afraid of nothing on the earth, above the earth, beneath the earth, except to do wrong.\"\n\nIn 1861, he gave a speech in which he defended the institution of slavery and said it was \"an error\" to assume \"the equality of the races.\"\n\n\"Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its corner-stone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition,\" he said.\n\nHis statue is part of the National Statuary Hall Collection. Each state has only two statues in this collection, which is meant to represent some of the most notable figures in American history. The state of Georgia contributed Stephens' statue in 1927.\n\nOn Thursday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the inclusion of Confederate statues \"reprehensible\" and said they should be removed.\n\n\"There is no room for celebrating the violent bigotry of the men of the Confederacy in the hallowed halls of the United States Capitol or in places of honor across the country,\" she said.\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) announced Wednesday that he plans to introduce legislation to remove Confederate statues from the Capitol.\n\nI will be introducing a bill to remove Confederate statues from the US Capitol building. This is just one step. We have much work to do. -- Cory Booker (@CoryBooker)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\n\"We will never solve America's race problem if we continue to honor traitors who fought against the United States in order to keep African Americans in chains. By the way, thank God, they lost,\" added Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, in a statement to ABC News.\n\nThe renewed attention on these monuments comes after President Donald Trump defended white supremacists, including neo-Nazis, during their violent rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. over the weekend regarding the removal of a tribute to Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nTrump said there were \"very fine people on both sides\" and added that \"both sides\" were to blame for the violence. On Thursday morning, he said it was a shame the country was removing \"beautiful\" monuments to the country's history.\n\nSad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You..... -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nBelow are some of the Confederate-era statues in the U.S. Capitol, and thoughts from the states' senators on Booker's legislation and the monuments.\n\nJohn C. Calhoun and Wade Hampton, South Carolina\n\nAlthough Calhoun died before the Civil War, he led the pro-slavery faction while a senator from South Carolina in the years leading up to it. He famously described slavery as a \"positive good\" rather than a \"necessary evil.\" He later served as secretary of war, secretary of state and vice president.\n\nHis portrait hangs just outside the LBJ room, where Republicans gather weekly for lunch meetings.\n\nSouth Carolina's other statue is of Wade Hampton, who was one of the state's largest slaveholders and a Confederate cavalry leader.\n\nThe office of Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) declined to weigh in on the issue, and Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) did not return a request for comment.\n\nJefferson Davis, Mississippi\n\nDavis was the president of the Confederacy. The office of Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) did not return a request for comment on Booker's legislation. But Chris Gallegos, spokesman for Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), replied, \"Senator Cochran has stated previously that it is up to each state to determine which statues it chooses to have placed in the Capitol.\"\n\nRobert E. Lee, Virginia\n\nLee was a commander of Confederate forces from Virginia. The state's two senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, both Democrats, said they support Booker's bill.\n\n\"Senator Kaine thinks Senator Booker's proposal is a good idea, and he plans to work with him on the bill and support it,\" Kaine spokeswoman Sarah Peck said. \"He also believes the Senate needs to work to address the fundamental inequities in our society that have left African-Americans and families of color in this country with far less wealth, higher unemployment rates, fewer opportunities and less protection under the law.\"\n\nIn an interview Thursday morning with WRVA, a radio station in Richmond, Warner confirmed that he was going to work with Booker on his bill.\n\n\"I think, whether it's Richmond, whether it's Charlottesville, whether it's towns across Virginia - and we probably have more memorials and monuments than any state - I think there's going to have to be a local process in every community, and we're going to have to have tough, and in many ways overdue conversations, about race. And I think, yes, context and questions will come up,\" Warner said. \"And you'll find, I think, as the history is laid out, that many of these statues were put up, perhaps not as memorials, but were put up by arch-segregationists, in a way, to intimidate our fellow Virginians who were of African-American descent.\"\n\nZebulon Vance, North Carolina\n\nVance was a Confederate military officer, as well as a governor and senator from North Carolina.\n\nRebecca Watkins, spokeswoman for Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), said she was not familiar with Booker's bill but noted that the decision on which statues go into the U.S. Capitol come from the state General Assembly.\n\nNorth Carolina's second statue honors Charles Brantley Aycock. Although he was not a Civil War figure, he was a white supremacist leader who promised to stop \"Negro domination.\" In 2015, Burr urged the General Assembly to replace Aycock's statue with one of evangelical minister Billy Graham.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) did not return a request for comment.\n\nAlexander Hamilton Stephens, Georgia\n\nStephens was vice president of the Confederacy. His statue in the Capitol is near the one of civil rights activist Rosa Parks. Neither of the state's Republican senators, Johnny Isakson and David Perdue, returned a request for comment.\n\nRyan Grim contributed reporting.\n\nWant more updates from Amanda Terkel?

Bennie Thompson of Mississippi called on lawmakers in both parties \"to work with me to ensure the permanent removal of all offensive and despicable Confederate imagery\" from the Capitol, Politico reported.\n\n\"Confederate memorabilia have no place in this country and especially not in the United States Capitol,\" Thompson said in a statement. \"These images symbolize a time of racial discrimination and segregation that continues to haunt this country and many African-Americans who still to this day face racism and bigotry.\"\n\nEach state can choose two figures to honor, according to the Architect of the Capitol. Of the 100 statues, 35 are located in National Statuary Hall and 13 are in the crypt, representing the 13 original colonies. The 10 that depict Confederate figures hail from nine states: Georgia, Florida, Alabama, West Virginia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.\n\nGeorgia, for instance, chose Alexander Hamilton Stephens, vice president of the Confederacy, a member of Congress in the Reconstruction Era, and governor for less than half a year. Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy, was selected by Mississippi in 1931.\n\nRyan's office responded to Pelosi's statement. \"These are decisions for those states to make,\" said Doug Andres, spokesman for Ryan.\n\nState legislators can select replacements which must be approved by the governor and the Joint Committee on the Library. Congress does still maintain authority to order the removal of statues through appropriate legislation, but that would currently require Republican support which does not seem likely, given Ryan's position.\n\nIn addition to Pelosi and Thompson, Rep. Dessbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) tweeted that her state's lawmakers \"should call a special session to replace\" the statue of Confederate Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith in the Hall.\n\nThese public statements represent a wave of similar requests after a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, turned deadly last weekend.\n\nPelosi also wrote in her statement that with Democrats leading Congress, \"we have recognized more women and people of color ... including Rosa Parks,\" a statue of that currently stands where a statue of Robert E. Lee -- now in the crypt -- once stood.\n\nGuidelines from the Architect of the Capitol require statues in the official collection to depict a deceased U.S. citizen \"illustrious for historic renown or for distinguished civic or military services.\"", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri":

But Trump's allies inside and outside the White House, most notably White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon, argued that Trump's pronouncements would rally his political base - while also serving as a welcome distraction from the policy stumbles and investigations that have hobbled the administration.\n\nDemocrats reacted with horror at Trump's enthusiasm for memorials to the Confederacy more than 150 years after the end of the Civil War and just five days after white nationalist and neo-Nazi protests in Charlottesville left one woman dead and at least 19 more people injured.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and others harshly condemned Trump's statements and called for the removal of Confederate statues from the halls of the U.S. Capitol. Some veteran Democrats, meanwhile, said Trump's remarks seemed aimed at rousing his base.\n\n\"He's hitting a raw and ugly political nerve around a certain segment of the electorate,\" said Democratic consultant Robert Shrum. \"But that's not enough to sustain him to get things done as president or get reelected.\"\n\nTrump's comments came as he also ratcheted up his rhetoric on the threat of Muslim extremists in the wake of a deadly van attack Thursday in Barcelona. Taking to Twitter, Trump recycled a discredited tale that he had promoted during the 2016 campaign, asserting that Gen. John J. Pershing had ordered that bullets be dipped in pigs' blood and used to execute Islamic terrorists in the Philippines. Historians have widely debunked the story as a fabrication.\n\nInside the White House, Trump advisers said the president is being guided chiefly by his own instincts, chafing at critical news coverage of his handling of the Charlottesville protests and charges of racism.\n\nBannon - a hard-line nationalist whose position has been threatened in recent days by his clashes with moderate colleagues and his blunt remarks to a liberal magazine -- has fiercely defended Trump in internal staff discussions, according to White House officials.\n\nIn an email to The Washington Post on Thursday, Bannon said Democrats do not understand Trump and underestimate his appeal.\n\n\"This past election, the Democrats used every personal attack, including charges of racism, against President Trump. He then won a landslide victory on a straightforward platform of economic nationalism,\" Bannon wrote. \"As long as the Democrats fail to understand this, they will continue to lose. But leftist elites do not value history, so why would they learn from history?\"\n\nOthers in Trump's orbit agree with him, believing there is a potential strategy in decrying identity politics and political correctness - a message that resonates with his base. But even within Trump's circle, there are those who wonder whether Trump has gone too far and risks alienating some of the swing voters who voted for him last year with hope for change, not racial division.\n\n\"He was saying that this political correctness could lead to trying to rewrite American history. The problem is that's not the time to bring this up,\" said one Republican operative and unofficial White House adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment. \"Now is the time to lower the emotional temperature of the country.\"\n\nMany Republican leaders and lawmakers cringed as the president tweeted, and they sought to distance themselves from the White House. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., a moderate, went so far as to call for Bannon to be fired.\n\nAssociates of House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Thursday that Trump would be putting the party's already stalled legislative agenda at risk if he continued to carry the cause of defending Confederate statues.\n\n\"It's a pretty tough transition from 'white supremacists aren't so bad' to 'let's do tax reform,' \" Josh Holmes, a longtime McConnell ally, said in an interview.\n\nBut the concerns ran deeper than prospects on Capitol Hill. Some prominent Republicans said they were unsettled by the caustic nature of Trump's comments this week and what those remarks revealed about his ability to articulate positions on race and history that unite rather than divide the country.\n\n\"What we want to see from our president is clarity and moral authority. And that moral authority is compromised when Tuesday happened,\" Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., the GOP's lone black senator, told VICE on Thursday, referring to a news conference in which Trump said \"both sides\" shared blame for the violence at the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville.\n\nSen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has worked closely with Trump in the past, underscored the growing Republican unease when he told reporters Thursday that Trump \"has not demonstrated that he understands the character of this nation.\"\n\n\"He has not demonstrated that he understands what has made this nation great and what it is today, and he's got to demonstrate the characteristics of a president who understands that. And without the things that I just mentioned happening, our nation is going to go through great peril,\" Corker said.\n\n\"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period,\" Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, wrote Thursday on Twitter.\n\nTrump shrugged off the criticism. Earlier Thursday, he slammed Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., for their criticism of his leadership in the wake of the Charlottesville tragedy.\n\nOn Twitter, Trump called Flake \"WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate,\" and praised Flake's primary challenger.\n\nMcConnell responded with a tweet later in the day, calling Flake \"an excellent Senator and a tireless advocate for Arizona and our nation.\"\n\n\"He has my full support,\" McConnell added.\n\nThere is little public polling over what to do with Confederate monuments. An NPR-PBS survey conducted Monday and Tuesday by Marist College found that 62 percent of respondents said statues honoring Confederate leaders should remain as a historical symbol; 27 percent said they should be removed because they are offensive to some people.\n\nThat poll found a large partisan divide: Republicans prefer to keep statues by 86 percent to 6 percent, while Democrats split 44 percent for keeping them and 47 percent for removing them. Among African Americans in the survey, 44 percent favored keeping them, and 40 percent favored removal.\n\nIn his tweets Thursday, Trump appeared to equate Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, who commanded Southern forces in the Civil War to secede from the United States, with Founding Fathers George Washington and Thomas Jefferson as potential targets of criticism because of Washington and Jefferson's status as slave owners - an argument he first advanced at his Tuesday news conference.\n\n\"You . . . can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson?\"\n\nCharlottesville wasn't the first place that white supremacists had gathered recently to oppose the removal of a Confederate statue, but last weekend was the first rally marked by deadly violence. More rallies are planned for other cities as a show of force to pressure municipal officials into leaving Civil War symbols in place.\n\nTrump's new enthusiasm on statues stands apart from his views last year. On the campaign trail, Trump said he agreed with the decision in 2015 by then-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to remove a Confederate flag from the statehouse grounds following the mass shooting by Dylann Roof, a white supremacist who killed nine African Americans at a black church. Haley now serves as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\n\n\"I would take it down, yes,\" Trump said at the time. \"I think they should put it in a museum and respect whatever it is you have to respect.\"\n\nDemocrats moved aggressively on Thursday to counter what they described as a disturbing turn.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Trump's tweets Thursday represented an attempt to \"divert attention away from the president's refusal to unequivocally and full-throatedly denounce white supremacy, neo-Nazism, and other forms of bigotry.\"\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., a member of the House Judiciary Committee, and a small group of Democrats called for a congressional resolution to censure Trump. Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., said he would seek to introduce articles of impeachment. Neither measure faces a chance of success in the GOP-controlled House.\n\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., announced late Wednesday that he intends to introduce legislation after Congress reconvenes next month calling for the removal of at least a dozen statues of Confederate soldiers and politicians inside the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThat collection includes two statues selected by each state, and the presence of Confederate political and military leaders among them - as well as other figures with well-known discriminatory views - has previously attracted protests.\n\n\"There is no room for celebrating the violent bigotry of the men of the Confederacy in the hallowed halls of the United States Capitol or in places of honor across the country,\" Pelosi said.\n\nA spokesman for Ryan said congressional Republicans would not intervene to remove the statues without the states' consent.\n\n\"These are decisions for those states to make,\" said Ryan spokesman Doug Andres.\n\n- - -\n\nThe Washington Post's Sean Sullivan, Ashley Parker and Scott Clement contributed to this report.\n\nAfter President Trump's most recent rhetoric about Charlottesville inflamed even more criticism, a handful of GOP lawmakers, including Sens. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., are criticizing Trump directly, while others stay silent.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100, "id":

Cory Booker (D-NJ) announced on Wednesday that he was planning to write legislation to remove statues in the U.S. Capitol that honor the Confederacy, a move that coincided with President Trump's defense of the country's monuments on Twitter early Thursday morning.\n\n\"The National Statuary Hall Collection is intended to celebrate 'illustrious' Americans 'worthy of... national commemoration,'\" Booker said in a statement provided to The Daily Beast. \"It should be a place of honor for patriots -- those who have served, sacrificed, or made significant contributions to our nation's greatness and glory. Individuals who were treasonous to the United States, who took up arms against their own country, and inflicted catastrophic death and suffering among U.S. citizens, should not be afforded such a rare honor in this sacred space.\"\n\nThe bill is still being drafted, according to Booker's office and won't be introduced until after the August recess. But regardless of how it materializes, the process of removing the ten Confederate statues that are part of the National Statuary Hall Collection will be difficult.\n\nAn 1864 law to create the hall from then-Representative Justin S. Morrill established that each state would contribute two statues to be housed in the Capitol. In 1933, Congress authorized displaying the statues throughout the building so as to avoid cluttering in the hall which now houses 35 of the original statues. This resolution, enacted into law in 2000 also provided states with the ability to replace their statues if they chose to do so. For instance, in 2009, California swapped out its statue of minister Thomas Starr King with former president Ronald Reagan.\n\nCongress could hypothetically eliminate all the statues representing the Confederacy from the building with new legislation like Booker's, but it's unclear if it could get the necessary votes.\n\n\"I can't think of any reason why they couldn't be removed by statute,\" Josh Chafetz, a professor of law at Cornell Law School told The Daily Beast. \"Problem is, Booker would have to get that statute through 2 GOP-controlled chambers and then signed by Trump (or, I suppose, get it passed by veto-proof supermajorities in both chambers).\"\n\nChafetz pointed to the fact that there is a provision for moving the statues in the current law which \"appears to allow the Joint Committee on the Library to order them moved anywhere within the Capitol,\" even to a broom closet for instance. But Booker is not on that joint committee. Any effort he pushes would have to come through legislation.\n\nAnd absent that, it is ultimately the jurisdiction of the states to decide what to do with the statues that represent them, according to guidelines provided by the Architect of the Capitol (PDF).\n\nLawmakers have considered the idea of removing Confederate statues from the capital before, notably after the shooting at an African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. Democrats successfully relocated a statue of Robert E. Lee in National Statuary Hall when they controlled the House during the Obama years. But other efforts have gone nowhere.\n\nBooker's push, which comes in the wake of a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that resulted in the death of one and the injuring of 19, has a bit of steam to it, though not a critical amount as of Thursday afternoon. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) also called for the elimination of the statues and Virginia Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner indicated that they are supportive of Booker's yet-to-be-written bill.\n\nA spokesperson for Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) also told The Daily Beast that she is supportive of removing Confederate monuments from the Capitol but did not specifically weigh in on the prospective legislation.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was not as openly enthusiastic about the idea, implying that it was a distraction of sorts from the controversy surrounding Trumps sympathetic comments toward the white nationalists who had gathered in Charlottesville.\n\n\"President Trump and Steve Bannon are trying to divert attention away from the president's refusal to unequivocally and full-throatedly denounce white supremacy, neo-Nazism, and other forms of bigotry,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"While it is critical that we work towards the goal of Senator Cory Booker's legislation, we must continue to denounce and resist President Trump for his reprehensible actions.\"", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "wgt": 100, "id": 123, "label":

But Trump's allies inside and outside the White House, most notably White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon, argued that Trump's pronouncements would rally his political base - while also serving as a welcome distraction from the policy stumbles and investigations that have hobbled the administration.\n\nDemocrats reacted with horror at Trump's enthusiasm for memorials to the Confederacy more than 150 years after the end of the Civil War and just five days after white nationalist and neo-Nazi protests in Charlottesville left one woman dead and at least 19 more people injured.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and others harshly condemned Trump's statements and called for the removal of Confederate statues from the halls of the U.S. Capitol. Some veteran Democrats, meanwhile, said Trump's remarks seemed aimed at rousing his base.\n\n\"He's hitting a raw and ugly political nerve around a certain segment of the electorate,\" said Democratic consultant Robert Shrum. \"But that's not enough to sustain him to get things done as president or get reelected.\"\n\nTrump's comments came as he also ratcheted up his rhetoric on the threat of Muslim extremists in the wake of a deadly van attack Thursday in Barcelona. Taking to Twitter, Trump recycled a discredited tale that he had promoted during the 2016 campaign, asserting that Gen. John J. Pershing had ordered that bullets be dipped in pigs' blood and used to execute Islamic terrorists in the Philippines. Historians have widely debunked the story as a fabrication.\n\nInside the White House, Trump advisers said the president is being guided chiefly by his own instincts, chafing at critical news coverage of his handling of the Charlottesville protests and charges of racism.\n\nBannon - a hard-line nationalist whose position has been threatened in recent days by his clashes with moderate colleagues and his blunt remarks to a liberal magazine -- has fiercely defended Trump in internal staff discussions, according to White House officials.\n\nIn an email to The Washington Post on Thursday, Bannon said Democrats do not understand Trump and underestimate his appeal.\n\n\"This past election, the Democrats used every personal attack, including charges of racism, against President Trump. He then won a landslide victory on a straightforward platform of economic nationalism,\" Bannon wrote. \"As long as the Democrats fail to understand this, they will continue to lose. But leftist elites do not value history, so why would they learn from history?\"\n\nOthers in Trump's orbit agree with him, believing there is a potential strategy in decrying identity politics and political correctness - a message that resonates with his base. But even within Trump's circle, there are those who wonder whether Trump has gone too far and risks alienating some of the swing voters who voted for him last year with hope for change, not racial division.\n\n\"He was saying that this political correctness could lead to trying to rewrite American history. The problem is that's not the time to bring this up,\" said one Republican operative and unofficial White House adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment. \"Now is the time to lower the emotional temperature of the country.\"\n\nMany Republican leaders and lawmakers cringed as the president tweeted, and they sought to distance themselves from the White House. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., a moderate, went so far as to call for Bannon to be fired.\n\nAssociates of House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Thursday that Trump would be putting the party's already stalled legislative agenda at risk if he continued to carry the cause of defending Confederate statues.\n\n\"It's a pretty tough transition from 'white supremacists aren't so bad' to 'let's do tax reform,' \" Josh Holmes, a longtime McConnell ally, said in an interview.\n\nBut the concerns ran deeper than prospects on Capitol Hill. Some prominent Republicans said they were unsettled by the caustic nature of Trump's comments this week and what those remarks revealed about his ability to articulate positions on race and history that unite rather than divide the country.\n\n\"What we want to see from our president is clarity and moral authority. And that moral authority is compromised when Tuesday happened,\" Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., the GOP's lone black senator, told VICE on Thursday, referring to a news conference in which Trump said \"both sides\" shared blame for the violence at the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville.\n\nSen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has worked closely with Trump in the past, underscored the growing Republican unease when he told reporters Thursday that Trump \"has not demonstrated that he understands the character of this nation.\"\n\n\"He has not demonstrated that he understands what has made this nation great and what it is today, and he's got to demonstrate the characteristics of a president who understands that. And without the things that I just mentioned happening, our nation is going to go through great peril,\" Corker said.\n\n\"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period,\" Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, wrote Thursday on Twitter.\n\nTrump shrugged off the criticism. Earlier Thursday, he slammed Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., for their criticism of his leadership in the wake of the Charlottesville tragedy.\n\nOn Twitter, Trump called Flake \"WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate,\" and praised Flake's primary challenger.\n\nMcConnell responded with a tweet later in the day, calling Flake \"an excellent Senator and a tireless advocate for Arizona and our nation.\"\n\n\"He has my full support,\" McConnell added.\n\nThere is little public polling over what to do with Confederate monuments. An NPR-PBS survey conducted Monday and Tuesday by Marist College found that 62 percent of respondents said statues honoring Confederate leaders should remain as a historical symbol; 27 percent said they should be removed because they are offensive to some people.\n\nThat poll found a large partisan divide: Republicans prefer to keep statues by 86 percent to 6 percent, while Democrats split 44 percent for keeping them and 47 percent for removing them. Among African Americans in the survey, 44 percent favored keeping them, and 40 percent favored removal.\n\nIn his tweets Thursday, Trump appeared to equate Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, who commanded Southern forces in the Civil War to secede from the United States, with Founding Fathers George Washington and Thomas Jefferson as potential targets of criticism because of Washington and Jefferson's status as slave owners - an argument he first advanced at his Tuesday news conference.\n\n\"You . . . can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson?\"\n\nCharlottesville wasn't the first place that white supremacists had gathered recently to oppose the removal of a Confederate statue, but last weekend was the first rally marked by deadly violence. More rallies are planned for other cities as a show of force to pressure municipal officials into leaving Civil War symbols in place.\n\nTrump's new enthusiasm on statues stands apart from his views last year. On the campaign trail, Trump said he agreed with the decision in 2015 by then-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to remove a Confederate flag from the statehouse grounds following the mass shooting by Dylann Roof, a white supremacist who killed nine African Americans at a black church. Haley now serves as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\n\n\"I would take it down, yes,\" Trump said at the time. \"I think they should put it in a museum and respect whatever it is you have to respect.\"\n\nDemocrats moved aggressively on Thursday to counter what they described as a disturbing turn.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Trump's tweets Thursday represented an attempt to \"divert attention away from the president's refusal to unequivocally and full-throatedly denounce white supremacy, neo-Nazism, and other forms of bigotry.\"\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., a member of the House Judiciary Committee, and a small group of Democrats called for a congressional resolution to censure Trump. Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., said he would seek to introduce articles of impeachment. Neither measure faces a chance of success in the GOP-controlled House.\n\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., announced late Wednesday that he intends to introduce legislation after Congress reconvenes next month calling for the removal of at least a dozen statues of Confederate soldiers and politicians inside the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThat collection includes two statues selected by each state, and the presence of Confederate political and military leaders among them - as well as other figures with well-known discriminatory views - has previously attracted protests.\n\n\"There is no room for celebrating the violent bigotry of the men of the Confederacy in the hallowed halls of the United States Capitol or in places of honor across the country,\" Pelosi said.\n\nA spokesman for Ryan said congressional Republicans would not intervene to remove the statues without the states' consent.\n\n\"These are decisions for those states to make,\" said Ryan spokesman Doug Andres.\n\nRobert Costa is a national political reporter at The Washington Post.\n\nDavid Nakamura covers the White House.

Twenty-four percent said they should come down, while 11 percent said they weren't sure.\n\nWhite Americans also overwhelmingly supported keeping up Confederate monuments- 65 percent said they should stay, while 25 percent said they should be taken down. Eight percent said they weren't sure if they should stay up or not. Most Republicans, Independents and those who identified as \"soft\" Democrats said the statues should stay. Fifty-seven percent of those identified as \"strong\" Democrats said the statues should be removed.\n\nLawmakers and city officials are calling for the removal of Confederate statues, particularly in light of the Charlottesville riots, where white supremacists gathered in part to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E.

Baltimore city workers removed four Confederate statues late Tuesday night.\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus has also proposed the removal of the statues from the U.S. Capitol Building.\n\n\"We will never solve America's race problem if we continue to honor traitors who fought against the United States in order to keep African Americans in chains.

But Trump's allies inside and outside the White House, most notably White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon, argued that Trump's pronouncements would rally his political base - while also serving as a welcome distraction from the policy stumbles and investigations that have hobbled the administration.\n\nDemocrats reacted with horror at Trump's enthusiasm for memorials to the Confederacy more than 150 years after the end of the Civil War and just five days after white nationalist and neo-Nazi protests in Charlottesville left one woman dead and at least 19 more people injured.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and others harshly condemned Trump's statements and called for the removal of Confederate statues from the halls of the U.S. Capitol. Some veteran Democrats, meanwhile, said Trump's remarks seemed aimed at rousing his base.\n\n\"He's hitting a raw and ugly political nerve around a certain segment of the electorate,\" said Democratic consultant Robert Shrum. \"But that's not enough to sustain him to get things done as president or get reelected.\"\n\nTrump's comments came as he also ratcheted up his rhetoric on the threat of Muslim extremists in the wake of a deadly van attack Thursday in Barcelona. Taking to Twitter, Trump recycled a discredited tale that he had promoted during the 2016 campaign, asserting that Gen. John J. Pershing had ordered that bullets be dipped in pigs' blood and used to execute Islamic terrorists in the Philippines. Historians have widely debunked the story as a fabrication.\n\nInside the White House, Trump advisers said the president is being guided chiefly by his own instincts, chafing at critical news coverage of his handling of the Charlottesville protests and charges of racism.\n\nBannon - a hard-line nationalist whose position has been threatened in recent days by his clashes with moderate colleagues and his blunt remarks to a liberal magazine - has fiercely defended Trump in internal staff discussions, according to White House officials.\n\nIn an email to The Washington Post on Thursday, Bannon said Democrats do not understand Trump and underestimate his appeal.\n\n\"This past election, the Democrats used every personal attack, including charges of racism, against President Trump. He then won a landslide victory on a straightforward platform of economic nationalism,\" Bannon wrote. \"As long as the Democrats fail to understand this, they will continue to lose. But leftist elites do not value history, so why would they learn from history?\"\n\nOthers in Trump's orbit agree with him, believing there is a potential strategy in decrying identity politics and political correctness - a message that resonates with his base. But even within Trump's circle, there are those who wonder whether Trump has gone too far and risks alienating some of the swing voters who voted for him last year with hope for change, not racial division.\n\n\"He was saying that this political correctness could lead to trying to rewrite American history. The problem is that's not the time to bring this up,\" said one Republican operative and unofficial White House adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment. \"Now is the time to lower the emotional temperature of the country.\"\n\nMany Republican leaders and lawmakers cringed as the president tweeted, and they sought to distance themselves from the White House. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., a moderate, went so far as to call for Bannon to be fired.\n\nAssociates of House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Thursday that Trump would be putting the party's already stalled legislative agenda at risk if he continued to carry the cause of defending Confederate statues.\n\n\"It's a pretty tough transition from 'white supremacists aren't so bad' to 'let's do tax reform,' \" Josh Holmes, a longtime McConnell ally, said in an interview.\n\nBut the concerns ran deeper than prospects on Capitol Hill. Some prominent Republicans said they were unsettled by the caustic nature of Trump's comments this week and what those remarks revealed about his ability to articulate positions on race and history that unite rather than divide the country.\n\n\"What we want to see from our president is clarity and moral authority. And that moral authority is compromised when Tuesday happened,\" Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., the GOP's lone black senator, told VICE on Thursday, referring to a news conference in which Trump said \"both sides\" shared blame for the violence at the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville.\n\nSen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has worked closely with Trump in the past, underscored the growing Republican unease when he told reporters Thursday that Trump \"has not demonstrated that he understands the character of this nation.\"\n\n\"He has not demonstrated that he understands what has made this nation great and what it is today, and he's got to demonstrate the characteristics of a president who understands that. And without the things that I just mentioned happening, our nation is going to go through great peril,\" Corker said.\n\n\"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period,\" Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, wrote Thursday on Twitter.\n\nTrump shrugged off the criticism. Earlier Thursday, he slammed Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., for their criticism of his leadership in the wake of the Charlottesville tragedy.\n\nOn Twitter, Trump called Flake \"WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate,\" and praised Flake's primary challenger.\n\nMcConnell responded with a tweet later in the day, calling Flake \"an excellent Senator and a tireless advocate for Arizona and our nation.\"\n\n\"He has my full support,\" McConnell added.\n\nThere is little public polling over what to do with Confederate monuments. An NPR-PBS survey conducted Monday and Tuesday by Marist College found that 62 percent of respondents said statues honoring Confederate leaders should remain as a historical symbol; 27 percent said they should be removed because they are offensive to some people.\n\nThat poll found a large partisan divide: Republicans prefer to keep statues by 86 percent to 6 percent, while Democrats split 44 percent for keeping them and 47 percent for removing them. Among African Americans in the survey, 44 percent favored keeping them, and 40 percent favored removal.\n\nIn his tweets Thursday, Trump appeared to equate Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, who commanded Southern forces in the Civil War to secede from the United States, with Founding Fathers George Washington and Thomas Jefferson as potential targets of criticism because of Washington and Jefferson's status as slave owners - an argument he first advanced at his Tuesday news conference.\n\n\"You . . . can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson?\"\n\nCharlottesville wasn't the first place that white supremacists had gathered recently to oppose the removal of a Confederate statue, but last weekend was the first rally marked by deadly violence. More rallies are planned for other cities as a show of force to pressure municipal officials into leaving Civil War symbols in place.\n\nTrump's new enthusiasm on statues stands apart from his views last year. On the campaign trail, Trump said he agreed with the decision in 2015 by then-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to remove a Confederate flag from the statehouse grounds following the mass shooting by Dylann Roof, a white supremacist who killed nine African Americans at a black church. Haley now serves as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\n\n\"I would take it down, yes,\" Trump said at the time. \"I think they should put it in a museum and respect whatever it is you have to respect.\"\n\nDemocrats moved aggressively on Thursday to counter what they described as a disturbing turn.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Trump's tweets Thursday represented an attempt to \"divert attention away from the president's refusal to unequivocally and full-throatedly denounce white supremacy, neo-Nazism, and other forms of bigotry.\"\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., a member of the House Judiciary Committee, and a small group of Democrats called for a congressional resolution to censure Trump. Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., said he would seek to introduce articles of impeachment. Neither measure faces a chance of success in the GOP-controlled House.\n\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., announced late Wednesday that he intends to introduce legislation after Congress reconvenes next month calling for the removal of at least a dozen statues of Confederate soldiers and politicians inside the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThat collection includes two statues selected by each state, and the presence of Confederate political and military leaders among them - as well as other figures with well-known discriminatory views - has previously attracted protests.\n\n\"There is no room for celebrating the violent bigotry of the men of the Confederacy in the hallowed halls of the United States Capitol or in places of honor across the country,\" Pelosi said.\n\nA spokesman for Ryan said congressional Republicans would not intervene to remove the statues without the states' consent.\n\n\"These are decisions for those states to make,\" said Ryan spokesman Doug Andres.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100, "id": 276, "label":

Some prominent Republicans said they were unsettled by the caustic nature of Trump's comments this week and what those remarks revealed about his ability to articulate positions on race and history that unite rather than divide the country.\n\n\"What we want to see from our president is clarity and moral authority. And that moral authority is compromised when Tuesday happened,\" Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), the GOP's lone black senator, told VICE on Thursday, referring to a news conference in which Trump said \"both sides\" shared blame for the violence at the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville.\n\nSen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has worked closely with Trump in the past, underscored the growing Republican unease when he told reporters Thursday that Trump \"has not demonstrated that he understands the character of this nation.\"\n\n\"He has not demonstrated that he understands what has made this nation great and what it is today, and he's got to demonstrate the characteristics of a president who understands that. And without the things that I just mentioned happening, our nation is going to go through great peril,\" Corker said.\n\n\"Anything less than complete & unambiguous condemnation of white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the KKK by the @POTUS is unacceptable. Period,\" Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) wrote Thursday on Twitter.\n\nTrump shrugged off the criticism. Earlier Thursday, he slammed Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) for their criticism of his leadership in the wake of the Charlottesville tragedy.\n\nOn Twitter, Trump called Flake \"WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate,\" and praised Flake's primary challenger.\n\nMcConnell responded with a tweet later in the day, calling Flake \"an excellent Senator and a tireless advocate for Arizona and our nation.\"\n\n\"He has my full support,\" McConnell added.\n\nThere is little public polling over what to do with Confederate monuments. An NPR-PBS survey conducted Monday and Tuesday by Marist College found that 62 percent of respondents said statues honoring Confederate leaders should remain as a historical symbol; 27 percent said they should be removed because they are offensive to some people.\n\nThat poll found a large partisan divide: Republicans prefer to keep statues by 86 percent to 6 percent, while Democrats split 44 percent for keeping them and 47 percent for removing them. Among African Americans in the survey, 44 percent favored keeping them, and 40 percent favored removal.\n\nIn his tweets Thursday, Trump appeared to equate Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, who commanded Southern forces in the Civil War to secede from the United States, with Founding Fathers George Washington and Thomas Jefferson as potential targets of criticism because of Washington and Jefferson's status as slave owners -- an argument he first advanced at his Tuesday news conference.\n\n\"You .\u2009.\u2009. can't change history, but you can learn from it,\" he tweeted. \"Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson?\"\n\nCharlottesville wasn't the first place that white supremacists had gathered recently to oppose the removal of a Confederate statue, but last weekend was the first rally marked by deadly violence. More rallies are planned for other cities as a show of force to pressure municipal officials into leaving Civil War symbols in place.\n\nTrump's new enthusiasm on statues stands apart from his views last year. On the campaign trail, Trump said he agreed with the decision in 2015 by then-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to remove a Confederate flag from the statehouse grounds following the mass shooting by Dylann Roof, a white supremacist who killed nine African Americans at a black church. Haley now serves as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\n\n\"I would take it down, yes,\" Trump said at the time. \"I think they should put it in a museum and respect whatever it is you have to respect.\"\n\nDemocrats moved aggressively on Thursday to counter what they described as a disturbing turn.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Trump's tweets Thursday represented an attempt to \"divert attention away from the president's refusal to unequivocally and full-throatedly denounce white supremacy, neo-Nazism, and other forms of bigotry.\"\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), a member of the House Judiciary Committee, and a small group of Democrats called for a congressional resolution to censure Trump. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) said he would seek to introduce articles of impeachment. Neither measure faces a chance of success in the GOP-controlled House.\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) announced late Wednesday that he intends to introduce legislation after Congress reconvenes next month calling for the removal of at least a dozen statues of Confederate soldiers and politicians inside the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThat collection includes two statues selected by each state, and the presence of Confederate political and military leaders among them -- as well as other figures with well-known discriminatory views -- has previously attracted protests.\n\n\"There is no room for celebrating the violent bigotry of the men of the Confederacy in the hallowed halls of the United States Capitol or in places of honor across the country,\" Pelosi said.\n\nA spokesman for Ryan said congressional Republicans would not intervene to remove the statues without the states' consent.\n\n\"These are decisions for those states to make,\" said Ryan spokesman Doug Andres.\n\nSean Sullivan, Ashley Parker and Scott Clement contributed to this report.", "date": "2017-08-18",

Terry McCauliffe.\n\n\"If Republicans are serious about rejecting white supremacy, I call upon Speaker Ryan to join Democrats to remove the Confederate statues from the Capitol immediately,\" Pelosi said in her statement. As she learned during her stint as Speaker of the House, lawmakers don't actually have that power.\n\nThere are eight statues that have some significance to the Confederacy, including Virginia's memorial to Robert E. Lee, and Mississippi's statue of former southern president Jefferson Davis. Each statue is officially owned by the state that gifted the memorial to the Capitol and is part of the National Statuary Hall Collection.\n\nThe Collection is managed by the Architect of the Capitol, and has been since 1864 when a federal code invited each of the 50 states to send no more than two statues to the hill as a \"gift.\"\n\n\"The president is hereby authorized to invite each and all the States to provide and furnish statues, in marble or bronze, not exceeding two in number for each State, of deceased persons who have been citizens thereof, and illustrious for their historic renown or for distinguished civic or military services such as each State may deem worthy,\" Sec. 1814 of the Revised Statutes states, according to the office of the Architect.\n\nEssentially, governance over which statues reside in our nation's Capitol rests with individual state leadership. Lawmakers or governors in each state can decide to remove a statue and replace it with someone else, a decision that's only happened seven times in the program's history.\n\nAs the governor of Virginia, McAuliffe would have the ability to remove the statue legally, since there is no existing state code that requires the decision be made by the Republican-controlled state legislature.\n\nPelosi understands that it's not easy to remove a statue. Early in her tenure, she made the decision to move the Lee statue to a less populated area of the Capitol and put a statue of Rosa Parks in the main hall of the complex, she was unable to remove it completely on her own. Surprisingly enough, Virginia had a Democratic governor then too, current Sen. Tim Kaine, who didn't offer to replace the statue at the time.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation reached out to Gov.

The Democrats have sent letters, called for hearings, launched campaign ads and promised resolutions of censure and impeachment designed to highlight the firestorm set off by the deadly protests in Charlottesville, Va. -- and the president's equivocal response.\n\nThe episode has forced congressional Republicans into a defensive crouch, caught between condemning the racist groups which organized the Charlottesville protest while taking pains not to rebuke the president, whose support they need to move the ambitious legislative agenda they've planned to finish before the year's end.\n\nThe Democrats are not making the GOP's balancing act easy. The leaders of the House minority and liberal caucuses are invoking the deadly attack on counterprotesters to pressure Trump into sacking the nationalist voices in the White House.\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus wants the removal of Confederate statues from the Capitol -- a campaigned backed by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Thursday.\n\nAnd some Democratic appropriators are eying plans to use next month's government spending fight to secure funding for organizations that battle white supremacists and other hate groups.\n\nThe Democrats' campaign arms, meanwhile, are flooding supporters' email boxes with messages accusing congressional Republicans of demonstrating a \"lack of moral clarity\" that's empowered the mercurial Trump.\n\n\"House Republicans must be held accountable along with the President,\" said Tyler Law, spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nThe strategy marks a change of tack for the Democrats, who had shifted away from a sharp focus on Trump after that design largely failed in the 2016 election cycle. Launching their 2018 agenda last month, the Democrats presented an economic message that didn't mention the president at all.\n\nThe outcry from Charlottesville has changed their calculus, at least in the near-term, and party leaders said they have no plans to abandon their effort to pressure GOP leaders to take a stronger stand against Trump's more controversial actions.\n\n\"[Speaker Paul] Ryan [R-Wis.] has a long record there that's pathetic,\" said a Democratic leadership aide.\n\nThere are signs, however, that Democrats are not all on the same page. Pelosi on Thursday gave a full-throated push for the removal of Confederate statues from the Capitol -- a response to Trump's tweets hours earlier defending such monuments. Sen. Cory BookerCory Anthony BookerBooker: Republicans can't force new healthcare plan 'down our throats' Bill targets lead in schools' drinking water 'Batman v Superman' star pushes Cory Booker for president MORE (D-N.J.), a black lawmaker and possible 2020 presidential candidate, plans to introduce such a bill next month.\n\nBut Senate Minority Leader Chuck SchumerCharles SchumerDemocrats urge Trump to condemn Charlottesville violence Melania Trump on Charlottesville protests: 'No good comes from violence' It's time for McConnell to fight with Trump instead of against him MORE (D-N.Y.) issued a statement shortly afterward warning that Trump's focus on the statues aims \"to divert attention away from the President's refusal to unequivocally and full-throatedly denounce white supremacy, neo-Nazism and other forms of bigotry.\"\n\n\"While it is critical that we work toward the goal of Sen. Cory Booker's legislation, we must continue to denounce and resist President Trump for his reprehensible actions,\" Schumer said in a brief statement.\n\nFeaturing a who's who of white nationalist groups, Saturday's \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville quickly erupted into a series of violent confrontations between hundreds of white nationalist marchers -- many of them carrying firearms and chanting racist slogans -- and the counterprotesters gathered to oppose their bigoted message.\n\nAmid the commotion, a car rammed into a group of counterprotesters, killing a 32-year-old woman, Heather Heyer, and injuring at least 19 others before speeding away. A 20-year-old white nationalist from Ohio was arrested and charged with second-degree murder.\n\nIn his first response Saturday, Trump widely censured for blaming \"many sides\" for the day's tragic events. Only two days later did he denounce racism and rebuke the white supremacist groups by name. The delay drew criticism from both sides of the aisle, which grew to howls on Tuesday when the president amplified his initial judgment that \"alt-left\" counterprotesters bear equal blame for the bloodshed and that there were \"very fine people\" on both sides.\n\n\"You had a group on the other side side that came charging in without a permit and they were very, very violent,\" he said during a combative press conference at Trump Tower in Manhattan.\n\nTrump shifting the focus to Confederate statues may be a deliberate attempt to move the fight to more favorable ground. \"Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson -- who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\" he tweeted Thursday, referring to them as \"the beauty\" being removed from public spaces.\n\nAn NPR/PBS/Marist poll out Wednesday found that 62 percent of Americans polled favor keeping statues of historical Confederate figures in place. Trump's chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, argued that the left's \"race-identity politics\" would only boost support for the president.\n\n\"Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it,\" Bannon told The New York Times.\n\nBecause of the monthlong August recess, most GOP leaders and rank-and-file Republicans have managed to lay low and dodge questions about Trump's Charlottesville crisis, save for a tweet or statement generally condemning racism and bigotry.\n\nAnd some of Trump's close allies in Congress are still defiantly standing in his corner, arguing that the president did not defend the white supremacists and neo-Nazis who marched in Charlottesville.\n\nTrump's words \"coming out of Barack ObamaBarack ObamaCongress needs to assert the war power against a dangerous president CNN's Don Lemon: Anyone supporting Trump 'complicit' in racism DOJ warrant of Trump resistance site triggers alarm MORE's mouth would be hailed as poetic,\" Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), who Trump once interviewed for a Cabinet post, told The Hill.\n\nTrump \"separated the white supremacists from others protesting the removal of a statue. Not everyone who thinks statues should stay up are white supremacists,\" added Cramer, who said he personally didn't understand why anyone would want to display Confederate statues and symbols.\n\n\"I wish he'd stop talking about it at all so liberals and the media couldn't distort his words.\"\n\nOther GOP lawmakers said they didn't anticipate Republican leaders caving to Democratic demands for hearings, removing the statues or censuring Trump, though members of leadership and their aides were closely monitoring the situation.\n\nWhile most of those polled believe that Trump's response to Charlottesville wasn't strong enough, Trump still enjoys broad support in his party: 79 percent of Republican respondents still approve of his performance, while only 10 percent disapprove, according to that same NPR/PBS/Marist poll.\n\n\"The people that were never with him can use [Charlottesville] as their excuse to not be with him. The others in the middle just kind of go on with life and don't care what he said, and then there are people who support him,\" said one House GOP lawmaker, explaining the various factions in the party.\n\nWhile GOP leaders face pressure from Democrats to act, they're also being pressed by members to protect them from tough, unpopular votes that could infuriate conservative activists back home.\n\n\"A lot of people want to be protected so they say, 'Don't go too far this way. Keep us from having to do anything,' \" the GOP lawmaker said. \"The majority of the conference is saying, 'Don't make me vote on the [Confederate] flag amendment or gays in the military.' \"\n\nOn Thursday, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) became the first Republican in Congress to call for his party to hold hearings into the attack in Charlottesville and the rise of white supremacists and nationalists in America. Issa, who faces a tough reelection in 2018, is the former Oversight Committee chairman and sits on the Judiciary panel that has jurisdiction over law enforcement and human rights issues.\n\nBut a GOP aide said Judiciary Chairman Bob GoodlatteBob GoodlatteCongressional investigations -- not just special counsels -- strengthen our democracy How Trump's legal immigration cuts could be a blessing to Dreamers Judiciary Committee Republicans want a second special counsel: report MORE (R-Va.), whose conservative district sits just west of Charlottesville, has no plans to hold such a hearing at this time.\n\nSpokesmen for Ryan and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) did not respond to questions about whether GOP leaders were considering hearings or a vote to censure Trump over his Charlottesville comments.\n\nAs for the calls to remove Confederate statues from the Capitol, Ryan spokesman Doug Andres said the decision should be left up to the states. Under the current rules, each of the 50 states can display two statues in the U.S. Capitol; those statues can be replaced by the governors and legislatures of those states.\n\nThe debate over the fate of the statues echoes a similar fight in 2015 that followed the racially motivated shooting death of nine parishioners at a historic African-American church in Charleston, S.C.\n\nDemocratic leaders, at the time, had urged the removal of Confederate imagery from the Capitol, including statues. Conceding in part, Republican leaders agreed to remove the state flags adorning an underground subway tunnel -- including Mississippi's emblem, which contains the Confederate battle flag -- and replace them with giant commemorative coins.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri":

Calls for more to be removed have grown louder.\n\nThe controversial statue of Confederate General Robert E Lee. Reuters.\n\nThis has created an additional headache for cities and spurred another debate: how to dispose of the statues once they are taken down. Some have suggested museums, others putting them in Confederate cemeteries and one city councilman proposed using their metal to make likenesses of civil rights leaders. \"Melting them down and using the materials to make monuments for Frederick Douglass, Thurgood Marshall, Harriet Tubman would be powerful!\" Baltimore city councilman Brandon Scott wrote on Twitter this week. The mayor's office said that was unlikely.\n\nUnlike Eastern Europe\n\nThe debate contrasts sharply with how Eastern Europe handled thousands of statues following the collapse of Communism in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Often pulled down by angry mobs, some of the statues ended up in dumpsters and others in museums to teach people the evils of totalitarian regimes. In Budapest, a for-profit park hosts about 40 statues of communist heroes such as Karl Marx.\n\nIn the US South, the debate still rages between those nostalgic for the past and those who view the monuments as painful reminders of slavery.\n\nThere are more than 700 Confederate statues in the United States according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, most of them created in the 1910s and 1920s, decades after the Civil War ended. They were intended to reassert the power of white people, said Jonathan Leib, Chair of Political Science and Geography at Old Dominion University in Virginia.\n\n\"They're visible, tangible expressions of power,\" he said on Thursday.\n\nIn Birmingham, Alabama, Mayor William Bell ordered workers to hide a Confederate statue behind plywood boards, while the city challenges a state law banning the removal of such monuments. \"They represent acts of sedition against the United States of America and treason against the United State of America,\" he told Reuters on Wednesday.\n\nBut sympathies persist, as both lawmakers and citizens resist plans to remove them. \"I absolutely disagree with this sanitisation of history,\" Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin, a Republican, told WVHU radio on Tuesday.\n\nProper Context\n\nFor now, many of the removed statues gather dust in warehouses or, as in the case of New Orleans, sit disassembled in a city scrap yard, where two were found by local reporters. In Baltimore, statues are now in storage, according to the mayor's spokesman Anthony McCarthy, who said they will likely end up in a Confederate cemetery or a museum.\n\nMany city legislators have expressed interest in relocating statues to museums, where they might be viewed as historical artefacts and not rallying points for racism.\n\nAnna Lopez Brosche, city council president in Jacksonville, Florida, encouraged the removal of Confederate statues from public property on Monday and proposed placing them where they will be \"historically contextualised.\" In Lexington, Kentucky, Mayor Jim Gray has proposed removing statues from one city park, formerly the site of a slave auction block and whipping post.\n\nMeanwhile, a statue removed in Gainesville, Florida, on Monday is being returned to a local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, which erected it in 1904. The group, founded in 1894 by women descended from Confederate soldiers, put up many of the statues as part of their goal to display what they call \"a truthful history\" of the Civil War and mark places \"made historic by Confederate valour.\"\n\nSome historians argue that, as in Eastern Europe, the Confederate monuments should be preserved, but in the proper context. \"A slave whipping post isn't something we want up, just out in public without interpretation,\" said W Fitzhugh Brundage, American History professor at the University of North Carolina. \"But on the other hand, if you have it in the Smithsonian where people can see it and it can be properly interpreted, it's a valuable teaching tool.\"\n\nPublished Date: Aug 18, 2017 02:11 pm | Updated Date: Aug 18, 2017 02:11

Lee is seen, at Duke University's Duke Chapel in Durham, North Carolina, August 17, 2017. Jonathan Drake/Reuters\n\n(Reuters) - As communities across the United States redouble efforts to remove Confederate monuments from public spaces after a far-right rally in Virginia turned deadly, city leaders now face another conundrum: what to do with the statues.\n\nPresident Donald Trump described them on Thursday as \"beautiful statues and monuments,\" part of the history and culture of the country that will be \"greatly missed.\"\n\nBut they are seen by many Americans as symbols of racism and glorifications of the Confederate defense of slavery in the Civil War, fueling the debate over race and politics in America.\n\nCities are speeding up their removal since Saturday's rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a suspected white supremacist crashed a car into a crowd, killing one woman, during protests against the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee, who headed the Confederate army in the American Civil War.\n\nSince Monday, officials in Baltimore and Gainesville, Florida, have taken down statues while another was torn from its plinth by protesters in Durham, North Carolina. Calls for more to be removed have grown louder.\n\nThis has created an additional headache for cities and spurred another debate: how to dispose of the statues once they are taken down.\n\nSome have suggested museums, others putting them in Confederate cemeteries and one city councilman proposed using their metal to make likenesses of civil rights leaders.\n\n\"Melting them down and using the materials to make monuments for Frederick Douglass, Thurgood Marshall, Harriet Tubman would be powerful!\" Baltimore city councilman Brandon Scott wrote on Twitter this week. The mayor's office said that was unlikely.\n\nKarl Marx. en.wikipedia.org\n\nThe debate contrasts sharply with how Eastern Europe handled thousands of statues following the collapse of Communism in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Often pulled down by angry mobs, some of the statues ended up in dumpsters and others in museums to teach people the evils of totalitarian regimes. In Budapest, a for-profit park hosts about 40 statues of communist heroes such as Karl Marx.\n\nIn the US South, the debate still rages between those nostalgic for the past and those who view the monuments as painful reminders of slavery.\n\nThere are more than 700 Confederate statues in the United States according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, most of them created in the 1910s and 1920s, decades after the Civil War ended. They were intended to reassert the power of white people, said Jonathan Leib, Chair of Political Science and Geography at Old Dominion University in Virginia.\n\n\"They're visible, tangible expressions of power,\" he said on Thursday.\n\nIn Birmingham, Alabama, Mayor William Bell ordered workers to hide a Confederate statue behind plywood boards, while the city challenges a state law banning the removal of such monuments.\n\n\"They represent acts of sedition against the United States of America and treason against the United State of America,\" he told Reuters on Wednesday.\n\nBut sympathies persist, as both lawmakers and citizens resist plans to remove them.\n\n\"I absolutely disagree with this sanitization of history,\" Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin, a Republican, told WVHU radio on Tuesday.\n\nA statue of a Confederate soldier nicknamed \"Silent Sam\" stands on the campus of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, August 17, 2017. Jonathan Drake/Reuters\n\nFor now, many of the removed statues gather dust in warehouses or, as in the case of New Orleans, sit disassembled in a city scrap yard, where two were found by local reporters.\n\nIn Baltimore, statues are now in storage, according to the mayor's spokesman Anthony McCarthy, who said they will likely end up in a Confederate cemetery or a museum.\n\nMany city legislators have expressed interest in relocating statues to museums, where they might be viewed as historical artifacts and not rallying points for racism.\n\nAnna Lopez Brosche, city council president in Jacksonville, Florida, encouraged the removal of Confederate statues from public property on Monday and proposed placing them where they will be \"historically contextualized.\"\n\nIn Lexington, Kentucky, Mayor Jim Gray has proposed removing statues from one city park, formerly the site of a slave auction block and whipping post.\n\nMeanwhile, a statue removed in Gainesville, Florida, on Monday is being returned to a local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, which erected it in 1904.\n\nThe group, founded in 1894 by women descended from Confederate soldiers, put up many of the statues as part of their goal to display what they call \"a truthful history\" of the Civil War and mark places \"made historic by Confederate valor.\"\n\nSome historians argue that, as in Eastern Europe, the Confederate monuments should be preserved, but in the proper context.\n\n\"A slave whipping post isn't something we want up, just out in public without interpretation,\" said W. Fitzhugh Brundage, American History professor at the University of North Carolina.\n\n\"But on the other hand, if you have it in the Smithsonian where people can see it and it can be properly interpreted, it's a valuable teaching tool.\"\n\n(Reporting by Gabriella Borter in New York; Additional reporting by Taylor Harris and Jonathan Allen in New York; Editing by Dina Kyriakidou and

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California has called for the removal of Confederate statues from the Capitol as the contentious debate over the appropriateness of such memorials moves to the halls of Congress. (Associated Press File)\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who couldn't bring himself to denounce white supremacists following the outrages they committed Saturday in Charlottesville, Virginia, has lamented the rapidly accelerating trend of removing from public places monuments to Confederate figures.\n\nHe came up with a supremely inept analogy, noting that George Washington and Thomas Jefferson held slaves, like the honored Confederate politicians and generals.\n\nSo they did, but that is not the issue. George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were patriots who risked everything they had, including their lives, to create the United States.\n\nJefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson and a long list of others whose statues adorn town squares throughout what temporarily was the Confederacy, were traitors. They took up arms against their country, the most fundamental definition of treason.\n\nA more adept analogy with a Revolutionary War figure would be Benedict Arnold, an accomplished major general in the Continental Army who captured an entire British army at Saratoga before selling out to the British for cash and a military commission. There is a monument to him in the battlefield park at Saratoga, but his infamy is so great that it does not mention him by name, and depicts only a boot for the broken leg he suffered during the battle.\n\nThose who defend the Confederate monuments claim they are historical markers, but most of them lack any such context and actually are tributes.\n\nThe National Park Service has announced that it will not remove any Confederate monuments at the Gettysburg National Battlefield. That makes sense. There, the monuments are in historical context and part of the larger story.\n\nPaying homage to traitors makes no sense. History is history.

Being a resident of a Northern city with no Confederate statues, I never gave this issue much thought.\n\nIf I were black and saw a statue of a Confederate soldier, I would question honoring soldiers who fought for the states in rebellion against the Union over the issue of slavery. But I would be more concerned with living in a safe area and having a good job or business to support my family.\n\nThe answer is that we honor soldiers and warriors for their bravery, not their politics. The soldiers did not make the policies that allowed slavery. The politicians were the ones who allowed slavery to exist until the Civil War and the passage of the 13th Amendment. And most of the politicians who allowed the evil of slavery to persist were members of the Democratic Party. The Democrats ruled the Southern states that permitted slavery and ruled the Southern states after the Civil War that permitted segregation and discrimination against blacks. The Republican Party was formed in 1856 as the anti-slavery party that elected Lincoln in 1860, which caused some states to secede. The 13th and 14th Amendments were passed by a Republican Congress.\n\nOne would think that the anger would be against not Confederate soldiers, most of whom were poor and owned no slaves, but against the politicians. What is the benefit of removing statues of soldiers? Many of the Confederate officers also fought for our country in the Mexican War.\n\nAs President Trump asked, what next after the removal of statues of Robert E. Lee? It would seem logical that if statues of soldiers offend, then the statues of political leaders should offend more. Thus, logic would dictate we remove statues of Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and all other slave-owning political leaders. We would have statues only of John Adams and Alexander Hamilton. Next, we would remove statues of political leaders who did not end slavery and segregation.\n\nLogic also dictates that the Democratic Party acknowledge its role as the party of slavery. The KKK was part of the Democratic Party. Senator Robert Byrd was a KKK member. Supreme Court justice Hugo Black, appointed by FDR, was a member of the KKK. The leaders of the Democratic Party were much more to blame for slavery than ordinary soldiers. The Democrat politicians used the Confederate soldiers to fight the Civil War, and now the Democrats are using statues of Confederate soldiers to again push their agenda. This is another example of the hypocrisy of Democrats to shift the focus on the soldiers but not on the Democrat politicians responsible for slavery and the Civil War.\n\nThe real question, as Trump said, is this: how does removal of statues help blacks get jobs? How does it help blacks in badly run cities like Chicago, Baltimore, New Orleans, St. Louis, Cleveland, etc., all run by Democrats for years, and all with high crime rates, live in safety?", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "type": "loc", "id": "206540"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "loc", "id": "235649"}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southern United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "302937"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302944", "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302948", "label": {"eng": "Politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304050", "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304217", "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304262", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304393", "label": {"eng": "African American"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "305155", "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305165", "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305954", "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305960", "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307630", "label": {"eng": "Racial segregation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "309898", "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "310245", "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

Cory Booker (D-N.J.) plans to craft legislation that would remove the Capitol's statues lionizing supporters of the slave-holding era and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is calling for their elimination.\n\nPelosi on Thursday urged Republicans to join her in supporting removal of the Confederate figures from the Capitol, lending new momentum to Booker's effort. Only a few Democrats had previously called for the statues' removal after white supremacists staged a violent rally in Charlottesville over that city's likeness of Robert E. Lee.\n\nFun fact: in the statuary collection, which contains two statues from each state, there are a total of ten Confederates, and a total of nine women.\n\n* Alex Isenstadt reports that White House aides were taken aback when the president gave a Twitter endorsement to Sen. Jeff Flake's primary opponent, since they think she's a weaker candidate than some other possibilities. Fine tuned machine!\n\n* Mark Murray reports that the fate of confederate monuments has now become an issue in the closely watched Virginia gubernatorial contest. The Trump effect?\n\n* Julius Krein, who founded the pro-Trump journals American Affairs to give intellectual ballast to the Trump administration, says that he regrets supporting the president, and admits his harshest critics were right to point to his tendency to pander to racists.\n\n* A new analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy shows that nearly half the benefits of the Trump administration's proposed tax cut would go to the top one-half of one percent.\n\n* Adam Liptak reports that Justice Neil Gorsuch's decision to give a speech at Trump's hotel to a conservative group is raising questions among ethics experts.\n\n* Fred Imbert reports that the stock market took a tumble today, supposedly because investors are worried that the president is a lunatic.\n\n* Alice Ollstein reports that the Trump administration and Republican states are already initiating a plan of sorts to gut Medicaid, and they'll probably get away with it.\n\n* Jonathan Bernstein makes a strong case that Trump must let Steve Bannon go, for the good of the country -- and himself.\n\n* Ron Brownstein considers whether Trump is staining the GOP in a way it won't be able to erase.\n\n* Karen Attiah offers the kind of report on the events in Charlottesville you'd see if it happened in a foreign country.\n\n* Alyssa Rosenberg says that if we want to replace Confederate monuments with tributes to heroes who didn't betray their country in the cause of maintaining slavery, there are plenty of options.\n\n* Jodi Jacobson says yes, Donald Trump is a white supremacist, and we should stop beating around the bush about it.\n\n* The latest Quinnipiac poll shows Trump's approval at a healthy 39 percent.\n\n* At The Week, I examined how a single event like Charlottesville can send out ripples that transform the political terrain.\n\n* I also marveled at the fact that the president of the United States is now a full-blown neo-Confederate.\n\n* And Steve Benen gives us the backstory

Those arguments were revived this week when a white supremacy rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, left one person dead.\n\nIn 2016, Southern Poverty Law Center noted there were 1,503 Confederate \"place names and other symbols in public spaces.\" The study wasn't comprehensive, though.\n\nA student tour group posed for a photo at the site where a statue of Robert E. Lee and Thomas 'Stonewall' Jackson stood Aug.16, 2017 in Baltimore, Maryland. Photo: Getty Images\n\nTexas has three cities that still bare Confederate statues: Houston, Dallas and San Antonio. But they might not be there for long. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings called a meeting Tuesday regarding the fate the Confederate statues that stand in about 90 parks around the city.\n\nThe city memorialized General Robert E. Lee with a statue in Lee Park and the Confederate War Memorial in downtown Dallas, CNN affiliate KTVT reported.\n\n\"This is simple. We could remove them, the question is, how do we heal on this issue? To do that we have to talk and listen to one another,\" Rawlings told KTVT.\n\nHouston Mayor Sylvester Turner asked his staff to list parks that held the status and note whether they wanted to remove them.\n\n\"It is my hope that we can, in a very positive and constructive way, move forward,\" Turner told KTVT.\n\nNew York has busts of Robert E. Lee and Confederate Lt. Gen. Stonewall Jackson in University of New York's Hall of Fame for Great Americans in the Bronx and plans to remove them, according to Governor Andrew Cuomo.\n\n\"New York stands against racism,\" Cuomo tweeted Wednesday. \"There are many great Americans, many of them New Yorkers worthy of a spot in this great hall. These two Confederates are not among them.\"\n\nWashington, D.C., Florida, Alabama, Virginia, Georgia, Maryland and Massachusetts have all considered removing the statues that sit in parks and other public spaces.\n\nArizona and Pennsylvania are reportedly among the states that don't plan on removing Confederate monuments. Arizona Governor Doug Ducey said he didn't have any plans to remove the Confederate statues in his town. Instead, he would leave the decision up to the residents.\n\n\"It's not my desire or mission to tear down any monuments or memorials. We have a public process for this. If the public wants to be engaged on this, I'd invite them to get engaged in it,\" Ducey told CNN-affiliate KTVK Tuesday.\n\nPennsylvania park officials reportedly had no plans to remove the 1,300 statues, markers, and plaques in The Gettysburg National Military Park. The park, which memorialized soldiers who fought in the Battle of Gettysburg, has not received any grievances or requests to remove the monuments, Katie Lawhon, park spokeswoman told USA Today Tuesday.\n\n\"These memorials, erected predominantly in the early and mid-20th century, are an important part of the cultural landscape,\" Lawhon told USA Today in an email.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAs

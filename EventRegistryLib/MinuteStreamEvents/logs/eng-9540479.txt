One 63-year-old said that she doesn't see her Social Security keeping her afloat due to the lingering impacts of the pandemic, which caused her to lose her job and run through her savings.\n\n\"I know so many people my age that just don't know what they're going to do,\" she said. \"Other countries take care of their older people, and we should be able to do it, too.\"\n\nCrockett said that living in Turkey has given her so much financial relief that she doesn't see money being an issue for her as long as she remains abroad. She contributes to the community financially through donations as often as she can, and she said she's grateful for the welcoming atmosphere that greeted her upon her arrival.\n\n\"It's eye-opening,\" she said. \"It's an amazing, fulfilling experience to wake up in a country where you know absolutely no one, and you have to rely on your skills of communication, intuition, your skills of just being able to survive. And it's so fulfilling and so rewarding.\"\n\nAre you living abroad? Did moving improve your quality of life or do you want to return to the US?

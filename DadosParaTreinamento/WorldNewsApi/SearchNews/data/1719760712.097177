Consequently, it\u2019s imperative that landlords create a positive and harmonious rental relationship with their tenants by providing incentives that lead to loyalty and better tenant behaviors. This is beneficial to the landlord, because happy renters are more likely to re-sign leases, leading to lower vacancy rates and more stable rental income. Here are some best practices that can turn \"good\" tenants into \"great\" tenants who are more likely to rent from you long-term. Find the right tenants. It\u2019s important to find the right tenants from the beginning. Determining a renter\u2019s ability to afford the rent and pay it on time is key, but there are other attributes that make a tenant a good fit for a rental property. Run comprehensive tenant screening with full credit, criminal and eviction history reports to help identify rental candidates who are stable, reliable, responsible and do not pose a risk to other tenants or your property. Seeking references from previous landlords provides a good indication of whether an applicant is trustworthy, makes timely rent payments, follows lease terms, takes good care of the property and respects property rules. Interviewing prospective renters in person or over a video call presents a glimpse of their personality, communication skills and intent to rent longer term.

Just as landlords prefer to collect rent in a simple, timely manner, tenants prefer to pay rent in the easiest way possible. It\u2019s good practice to offer a variety of payment options, such as ACH, credit card, check or cash. Providing convenient, seamless methods of payments via a web or mobile app benefits both parties. If you want to increase the likelihood of receiving on-time rent payments, offer the ability for tenants to set up automatic payments. (Disclosure: My company provides a solution for this, as do others.) Many tenants will take advantage of this feature so they don\u2019t have to worry about forgetting to pay rent on time. In fact, my company's data shows that since 2020, tenants who used the autopay feature paid rent on time 99% of the time. Conversely, tenants not using autopay had an 88% on-time payment rate. Another way to nudge tenants to pay rent on time is to report on-time rent payments to the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion) to help tenants build and boost their credit scores. Our platform's data also showed that landlords were likely to see a 13% jump in on-time rent payments when using a credit-boosting feature. Combining autopay with credit-boosting features provides an added incentive and convenience to being punctual with rent payments. Prioritize good communication. Encouraging good communication from tenants is very important for maintaining a positive landlord-tenant relationship. Establish clear expectations and preferred methods of communication, while also creating a welcoming atmosphere that makes tenants feel like it\u2019s easy to approach you with questions, concerns and feedback. Perhaps most importantly, lead by example by responding promptly to tenant inquiries, concerns and maintenance requests. Also, listen to tenants\u2019 suggestions for improvement related to property maintenance, amenities or policies. This will send a clear message that you are responsive and value their feedback, making them more likely to communicate regularly and openly. Reallocate funds according to tenant needs. Take time to have conversations with your tenants, listen to what matters to them and respond accordingly by reallocating funds from your planned upgrades to improvements they prefer. For example, one of our landlords wanted to add a fresh coat of paint to her rental property, but discovered that her tenant thought the house was too drafty. They worked together to find the source of the drafts, and the landlord reallocated the money for painting to replacing doors and fixing the chimney. As a result, the grateful tenant then upgraded the property on their own by painting a stoop and pruning and planting in the yard. When you have really good tenants, you want to keep them happy so they stay long term. Making your tenants happy can also increase the chances that they will contribute to their own improvements to your property. Share your knowledge of the area. Sharing your knowledge of and tips about your property\u2019s local surroundings with tenants can greatly enhance their rental experience, make it easier and quicker for them to transition and settle into a new area, help them feel more connected to the community and contribute to a more enjoyable and fulfilling living experience during their residency. A great way to do this is to create a welcome packet that includes information about local amenities, local schools, public transportation, community events and nearby tourist attractions. Provide details and contact information for nearby grocery stores, pharmacies, food delivery services, parks, libraries and sports and recreational facilities. Safety tips including information about emergency services, nearby hospitals and urgent care clinics, neighborhood watch programs and crime prevention measures are often greatly appreciated. Tenants may also value your opinions about your favorite restaurants, cafes and coffee shops as well as recommendations for medical professionals and local service providers, such as plumbers, electricians, HVAC technicians and house cleaners. Share insider tips and secrets about the area, such as lesser-known hiking trails, scenic areas and other hidden gems. Work together to make a home. Landlords and tenants can work together to improve a rental property and make it a better home to live in. As with any great business, customer feedback and collaboration are some of the best ways to build a phenomenal product. Collaborating on upgrades or renovations to a rental property, implementing tenant-friendly policies such as allowing personalized decorations and looking for opportunities for improvements that benefit both landlords and tenants all contribute to building and maintaining a respectful relationship and a pleasant rental experience.

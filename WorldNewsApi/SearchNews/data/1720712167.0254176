All in a day\u2019s work for one of the world\u2019s elite participants in cliff diving \u2014 a sport in which sometimes the precipice isn\u2019t a cliff at all. Iffland, from Australia, said the competition among cliff divers jumping from the Institute of Contemporary Art during a Saturday contest in Boston was fierce. \u201cI know the pressure\u2019s coming \u2014 and the young girls are diving super well,\u201d Iffland said after winning the women\u2019s section. Iffland\u2019s victory was part of cliff diving\u2019s marquee event, which came to the hub of New England as the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series made the 100th stop in its history. Participants plunged from up to 90 feet (27 meters) in the air from the waterfront art museum into the chilly harbor below. British diver Aidan Heslop won the men\u2019s competition and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve all got our work cut out for us\u201d for the rest of the series. Boston is the only U.S. stop this year. The series wraps up in Sydney, Australia, in November. Cliff diving attracts a special kind of athlete, especially when winning means leaping from an art museum into potentially frigid waters below, organizers said. \u201cThese epic athletes train super hard to make sure every leap, somersault, twist and entry is perfect,\u201d organizers said in a statement. Practice and early competition rounds were held Friday. Judges scored Saturday\u2019s competitive round based on the divers\u2019 form and technique. Two dozen people competed. It was the third straight year that the popular spectator event has come to Boston. Organizers said it drew 45,000 people for the weekend. The art museum said in a statement that the event was a visually stunning opportunity for the public and a chance for the athletes to earn \u201ccrucial championship points along the way based on their final event positions.\u201d Whittle reported from Portland, Maine.", "summary": "<p>All in a day's work for one of the world's elite participants in cliff diving \u2014 a sport in which sometimes the precipice isn't a cliff at all.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/sports/sports/2024/06/09/theyre-on-the-edge-of-glory-and-the-edge-of-an-art-museum-as-cliff-divers-come-to-boston/\">They&#8217;re on the edge of glory, and the edge of an art museum, as cliff divers come to Boston</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.boston.com\">Boston.com</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.boston.com/sports/sports/2024/06/09/theyre-on-the-edge-of-glory-and-the-edge-of-an-art-museum-as-cliff-divers-come-to-boston/", "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24160627682045-66659fdd17366-768x432.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:39:00", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.455}

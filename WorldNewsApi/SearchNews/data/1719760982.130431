Trump melts down before hush money jurors begin deliberations", "text": "Shortly before he left the friendly confines of Trump Tower to make an appearance at his hush money trial in a Manhattan courtroom, Donald Trump took to his Truth Social platform to make a last-ditch protest over the court proceedings. On Wednesday, Judge Juan Merchan will present the 12-person jury with instructions on how to consider the 34 felony counts the former president is facing after being accused of falsifying business records to hide payments made to assist in the cover-up of his affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels. The jury is expected to begin deliberations sometime Wednesday with a verdict expected in days.

A CORRUPT AND CONFLICTED JUDGE. RELIANCE ON COUNSEL (ADVISE [sic] OF COUNSEL) NOT ALLOWED BY MERCHAN, A FIRST. HIS RULINGS, ON A CASE THAT SHOULD, ACCORDING TO ALL LEGAL SCHOLARS AND EXPERTS, NEVER HAVE BEEN BROUGHT, HAVE MADE THIS A BIDEN PUSHED WITCH HUNT. THERE WAS NO CRIME, EXCEPT FOR THE BUM THAT GOT CAUGHT STEALING FROM ME!

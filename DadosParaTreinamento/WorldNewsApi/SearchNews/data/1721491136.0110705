McKellen, 85, was in \u201cgood spirits\u201d after doctors said a scan showed he was expected to fully recover from the fall, a spokesperson for the Noel Coward Theatre said. The stage and screen veteran known for playing Gandalf in the Lord Of The Rings films and many stage roles over a six decade career cried out in pain after the fall, according to a BBC journalist at the theatre. McKellen was playing John Falstaff in Player Kings, a production of Henry IV, parts one and two, adapted and directed by Robert Icke, at the Noel Coward Theatre. He lost his footing and fell off the stage in a scene with the Prince of Wales and Henry Percy. The tumble startled theatregoers. \u201cSir Ian seemed to trip as he moved downstage to take a more active part in the scene,\u201d audience member Paul Critchley told the PA news agency, saying it was a shock. \u201cHe picked up momentum as he moved downstage which resulted in him falling off the stage directly in front of the audience.\u201d Staff and two doctors in the audience helped the ailing actor, the spokesperson said. The theatre was evacuated and the play was cancelled. The production for Tuesday was also cancelled to give McKellen time to rest. McKellen\u2019s career includes playing Magneto in the X-Men films and several Shakespearean characters including Richard II, Macbeth and King Lear. He has won a Tony Award for Amadeus, several Laurence Olivier Awards and has been nominated for two Oscars and several BAFTA awards.", "summary": "McKellen lost his footing and fell off the stage while performing in\u00a0Player Kings at the Noel Coward Theatre.", "url": "https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/ian-mckellan-falls-stage-london-expected-recover-392016", "image": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--6S6Tq_t---/c_crop,h_462,w_823,x_1,y_75/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2024/06/18/ap24169805868547.jpg?itok=vennNIuM", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 01:14:55", "author": "Cna Lifestyle", "authors": ["Cna Lifestyle"], "language": "en", "source_country": "sg", "sentiment": 0.168}

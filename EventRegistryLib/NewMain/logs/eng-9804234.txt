Kristi Noem and Sen. John Thune took to social media after the news broke Tuesday that Vice President Kamala Harris had chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate.\n\nWalz's elevation to the campaign post was quickly criticized by Noem, who wrote Tuesday morning that her Midwestern counterpart was \"no leader.\"\n\n\"He's a radical,\" Noem wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. \"I served with him in Congress. He pretended to be moderate, then showed his true extremist colors as soon as he became Governor.\"\n\nNoem and Walz served in Congress together from 2011 to 2019, and were elected to governorship for their respective states in 2018.\n\nNoem also claimed South Dakota has been beating the neighboring blue state economically for years. In a follow-up post, Noem labeled Walz as \"terribly radical\" based on a failed state bill brought by two Republican legislators that would have allowed Minnesota counties to essentially leave the state.\n\n\"Last year, nearly 7,000 Minnesotans moved to South Dakota because Walz took his people's Freedom away. Harris-Walz will be the most radical left-wing ticket in American history,\" Noem wrote.\n\nThe second-term South Dakota governor was once herself considered a contender for former President Donald Trump's vice-presidential pick. She received international criticism when she admitted to killing a 14-month-old hunting dog in a recent memoir, which hurt her public image within her own party. The book also had errors and exaggerations regarding meetings with foreign leaders, including a fabricated account of a meeting between the governor and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nThune echoed Noem's sentiment and called the Harris-Walz ticket \"the most radical and liberal presidential ticket in history.\"\n\n\"We can't turn the country into California. Vote Trump-Vance,\" Thune wrote on X.\n\nConversely, South Dakota Democrats were quick to back Harris' choice.\n\nState Party Chair Shane Merrill lauded Walz in a Tuesday statement, calling him a \"proven leader.\"\n\n\"He's shown that he can work across party lines, including when he flipped his district for US Congress. And, with a slim Democratic majority in the Minnesota legislature, he's worked on bipartisan policies for the betterment of his state,\" Merrill wrote. \"I'm thrilled to see the Midwest and small town America represented on the Democratic Presidential ticket.\"\n\nHe also compared the second-term Minnesota governor to Noem on the topic of youth food programs. South Dakota has resisted the use of federal funding meant to combat child hunger, while Walz earned the goodwill of teachers and children by signing a universal free school meals bill into law in 2023.", "source": {"uri": "eu.argusleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Argus Leader"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score":

Asking for the United States.\n\nGovernor Kristi Noem might have been a potential candidate for Vice President in early 2024, but the South Dakotan speed-ran her chances straight into the ground after outing herself as a puppy-murdering monster.\n\nYou'd think she would slink back into obscurity to wait out her inevitable 2026 ousting from office, but no, that would require remorse and shame. Instead, the insufferable woman has made it her mission to remain relevant, even if she is reviled. Her recent attempts to stay in the public eye have her yapping on X, formerly Twitter, about her feelings on actual Vice Presidential nominee and governor of the neighboring state of Minnesota, Tim Walz.\n\nEver since current VP Kamala Harris announced Walz as her 2024 running mate in early August, Noem has repeatedly tried to blast him. Harping on Walz's history of \"radical\" ideas, like providing free feminine hygiene products in schools, providing free food to schoolchildren, and striving to close the race inequality gap, it's clear that the 60-year-old lives rent-free in her mind.\n\nIt's also clear that Noem never looks at her comments, but honestly, it's probably best for her mental health that she doesn't. They're littered with furious commenters, all of whom refuse to let her forget that she's an admitted puppy killer.\n\nAngry Americans took the South Dakotan to task, many sharing images of Walz with adorable little puppies.\n\nThey laughed at her accusations of Walz being a \"radical\" and pointed to her slaughter of an innocent 14-month-old puppy named Cricket.\n\nOthers reminded the governor that she isn't allowed to step foot on 12% of her state after being banned from Tribal lands by the nine Native American tribes that call the state home.\n\nNoem is right about one thing: South Dakota is beating Minnesota in terms of growth and economy, but the Land of 10,000 Lakes has plenty over the Mount Rushmore state. Minnesota ranks third in the country in overall happiness and is in the top five for businesses. Noem is also, unsurprisingly, less popular than Walz. Just 43% of her less than one million constituents approve of her in the wake of the scandal. 53% of Walz's nearly 5.7 million back the governor despite the right's insistence that he mangled the George Floyd protests.\n\nAs Minnesotans lament the potential loss of their governor and Democrats fall in love with the potential VP, one thing is certain: Americans are sick of the dog-killing governor of South Dakota.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ash_martinez@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Ash Martinez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Dakota", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of South Dakota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rushmore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mount Rushmore"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Native Americans in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Tim-walz-Kristi-noem.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804234", "eventUri": "eng-9804234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem on Monday released a revised proposal for social studies standards in public schools that lays out a mostly shining vision of American history, after an initial draft of the standards came under heavy criticism last year from conservatives and Native American educators.\n\nThe Republican governor claimed the new proposed standards are free from \"political agendas\" and include an increased focus on Native American history. But they received swift criticism from some educators as a thinly veiled political document. They emphasize the qualities of America's founders and mimic language Noem has used as she jumped on the conservative cause of weeding certain \"divisive\" teachings on race from public schools.\n\nThe 15-member standards workgroup, selected partially by the governor, included Noem's chief of staff, two Republican lawmakers and the director of the South Dakota Catholic Conference, but just three educators certified by the Department of Education. The group's work was facilitated by William Morrisey, a former professor at Hillsdale College -- a conservative institution in Michigan that has tried to remake education across the country.\n\nNoem said . . .\n\n\"South Dakota's children deserve the very best social studies education in the nation. These standards raise the bar for the breadth and depth of civics and history education. They feature a true, honest, and balanced approach to American history that is not influenced by political agendas.\"\n\nNoem, who is seen as a potential 2024 White House contender, has also advocated for the \"1776 Pledge to Save Our Schools\" as part of a conservative drive to emphasize the qualities of the founders of the United States. She has also tried to purge so-called critical race theory from the state's public schools.\n\nDespite the academic framework being one of her favorite targets, her administration has provided scant evidence that teaching associated with critical race theory -- an academic framework that centers on the idea that racism is systemic in the nation's institutions and that those institutions maintain the dominance of white people -- exists in South Dakota schools. The state Department of Education spent hundreds of hours combing through its policies, guidance materials and websites, but its report released Monday found \"a very small number\" of instances where its material didn't line up with Noem's order to get rid of anything that contained \"divisive concepts\" on race.\n\nThe governor in a statement cast the report as \"proactively removing\" critical race theory as she promotes \"America's true and honest history.\"\n\nThe social studies standards, which provide a list of topics students should comprehend at each K-12 grade level, give her an opportunity to stamp that vision of U.S. history on the state's public schools. They are widely followed by school districts but are not mandatory.\n\nThe new 128-page document more than doubles the length of the proposed standards the Department of Education released last year. They would make the sprawling argument that the United States, though not without fault, is an exceptional nation that has uniquely advanced rights for every race and gender. They are also peppered with Christian history and explore the religion's influence on the nation's leading figures and on Western civilization.\n\nFor example, seventh grade students are expected to explain how the nation's founders advanced equal rights for every person and advanced the idea that each person \"is endowed with these rights by the God that created them, and that the existence of human slavery was understood by most, but not all, of the founders to be a contradiction of the principle of human equality.\"\n\nSeventh graders are also to be taught:\n\n\"Patriotism is the love of country, meaning that one holds his or her country up to an objective standard of moral right and wrong, preserving the ways in which the country does good and correcting the ways it sometimes does wrong.\"\n\nThe standards state they are intended, in part, to \"foster a love of country that, like any love, is not blind to faults.\"\n\nNick Tilsen, the president of an Indigenous advocacy organization called NDN Collective, said that when the standards start out with goals like that, they are bound to further a narrative that continues to treat minority groups unjustly. Adding . . .\n\n\"Her approach in this curriculum further perpetuates ignorance, further perpetuates racism and white supremacy. These priority areas are dominated by nationalism.\"\n\nThe proposed standards are the Noem administration's second attempt to update the learning objectives. Both the political left and right criticized last year's standard-setting process and led Noem to scrap that proposal and relaunch the process. Noem's new version, released Monday, appeased conservative critics.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Sue Peterson, who resigned in protest from last year's workgroup, praised the new standards in a statement released by the governor's office. She called them \"substantial and straightforward standards that emphasize our founding documents, our pursuit of freedom, and treat our nation's history honestly.\"\n\nNoem's office also attempted to head off criticism from Native American education advocates and included a statement from Joe Circle Bear, a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe who was part of the workgroup. Circle Bear said in the statement.\n\n\"Governor Noem promised to tell our story as part of American history, and these standards do that.\"\n\nThe new standards ask schools to teach students about the \"removal and relocation\" of the Dakota, Lakota and Nakota, major battles and massacres in their history, the effects of forced boarding schools on Native Americans, as well as Indigenous leaders such as Crazy Horse, Sitting Bull and Spotted Tail. It also covers the Civil Rights Movement and its leading figures, such as Rosa Parks and Malcolm X.\n\nBut Native American educators, who protested after the Department of Education last year cut references to Indigenous culture and history from a draft the workgroup submitted for final approval, said the new standards continued to push Indigenous history and culture to the periphery.\n\n\"They are not inclusive to say the least. The goal was to get away from inclusivity to push an agenda that the governor deems important,\" said Sarah White, who directs the South Dakota Education Equity Coalition. \"It's definitely going to further disenfranchise our students when it's missing that Indigenous lens.\"\n\nWhite said her group is strategizing how to weigh in on the social studies standards as they next become open to public comment at several hearings in the coming months. After the public comment period and potential revisions, the Board of Education Standards, which is appointed by the governor, will approve the new education standards. White said . . .\n\n\"We're hopeful that we can pack the house at all the public hearings.\"\n\nThe Department of Education is planning a separate review of the instructions for teachers included in the Oceti Sakowin Essential Understandings and Standards, which teach Lakota, Dakota and Nakota culture and history. The department also found two content standards in a technical education course called Introduction to Law and Public Safety II that ran afoul of Noem's executive order. Even though those standards align with industry expectations for law enforcement training, the department said it would recommend changes to the courses.", "source": {"uri": "angrybearblog.com",

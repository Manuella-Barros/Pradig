Among them, was 97-year-old Alfred Booker, who was 16 when he was involved in landing troops at Sword Beach, according to the BBC. The veteran recalled how it was the smoke he remembered most at first, with his battleship shelling the German defences. 'I can still see them young men getting killed right left and centre,' he said. 'Of course these lads wherever these shells landed, if they were near them, they would tear them to pieces, so you didn't see a man lying there. They had to be stopped and we did, we helped stop them.'

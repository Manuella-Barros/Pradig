The Cowboys cannot afford to get into a bidding war for the defender.\n\n\"Kansas City could instead turn to Stephon Gilmore, who spent last season with Dallas,\" Knox wrote in a May 6, 2024 story titled, \"1 NFL Veteran Free Agent That Could Help Each Super Bowl Contender in 2024.\" \"Gilmore was a strong performer for the Cowboys in 2023 and allowed an opposing passer rating of only 82.7 in coverage while starting all 17 games.\n\n\"A reunion with Dallas could still happen, but 'nothing imminent,' according to Michael Gehlken of the Dallas Morning News. While Gilmore, a five-time Pro Bowler and the 2019 Defensive Player of the Year, might not be available at a bargain, the Chiefs have the financial flexibility to land him.\"\n\nThe Cowboys are in an okay position at cornerback thanks to the emergence of DaRon Bland and the expected return of Diggs. Yet, the coaching staff would likely feel a lot better with a trio of Bland, Diggs and Gilmore. The Dallas Morning News' Michael Gehlken reported there is \"nothing imminent\" with the Cowboys potentially re-signing Gilmore.\n\n\"There is nothing imminent on a potential return for CB Stephon Gilmore, a person familiar with the situation said. Gilmore wore No. 21 for the Cowboys in 2023,\" Gehlken detailed in a May 1 message on X.\n\nIt remains to be seen what Gilmore will command with his next deal. Gilmore just completed a two-year, $20 million contract and had a $9.98 million cap hit in 2023.\n\nThe veteran may no longer be playing at a Pro Bowl level but still appears to be a solid NFL starter. Gilmore posted 54 tackles, 13 pass deflections, 2 interceptions and a forced fumble while playing in all 17 games for Dallas last season. Pro Football Focus gave Gilmore a respectable 74.4 grade (out of 100) for his play in 2023.\n\nThe longer Gilmore remains unsigned, the easier it is to believe Dallas is prepared to move in a different direction.

The veteran cornerback and 2019 NFL Defensive Player of the Year said while he plans to continue playing, he's not in any rush when it comes to picking his next team.\n\nGilmore, 33, recently spent the past one-plus seasons with the Cowboys after he was traded from Indianapolis during the 2022 season. He was not re-signed by Dallas this offseason despite picking off two passes, breaking up 13 more and starting in each of the Cowboys' 17 regular-season games.\n\n\"I'm still focused on playing, but it has to be the right opportunity,\" Gilmore recently told veteran NFL insider Josina Anderson. \"I feel like it's the age thing with some of these teams.

It's clear he still feels he is an elite player despite being on the \"wrong\" side of 30 and coming off a significant shoulder injury he suffered during the Cowboys' final regular-season game. It doesn't help that Gilmore plays a position that demands peak physical excellence given the talent and ability of today's receivers who are playing in an era that favors the offense.\n\nThere have been rumblings of a possible reunion between Gilmore and the Panthers, the team he spent the 2021 season with and was a Pro Bowler for the fifth and most recent time. But there hasn't been much movement on that front, according to The Athletic, despite Panthers general manager Dan Morgan saying after the draft that the team had been in contact with Gilmore.\n\nThe main question is whether Gilmore will ultimately settle for a less than desirable deal in order to play, or continue to wait for the offer/situation that he is hoping for.

Dallas may need to explore alternative options just in case the team does not meet Gilmore's asking price.\n\nBleacher Report's Kristopher Knox labeled former Miami Dolphins corner Xavien Howard as a potential replacement option for Gilmore. Earlier this offseason, the Dolphins released Howard who had a five-year, $90 million deal that was slated to run through the 2026 season. The four-time Pro Bowler is still searching for a new home following his release.\n\n\"Bringing back 2023 trade acquisition Stephon Gilmore could be an option,\" Knox wrote in a May 6, 2024 story titled, \"Free Agents Cowboys Should Pursue After 2024 NFL Draft.\" \"Gilmore was a very solid starter for Dallas in 2023, though that fact could put his price point out of the Cowboys' range.\n\n\"According to Michael Gehlken of the Dallas Morning News, there is 'nothing imminent' on a potential Cowboys-Gilmore reunion. Instead, the Cowboys should kick the proverbial tires on four-time Pro Bowler Xavien Howard,\" Knox added.\n\n\"A foot injury hampered his 2023 campaign, but the 30-year-old was widely considered one of the league's premier pass defenders before that. And Howard might be able to take a budget-friendly deal if it means making a deep playoff run.\"\n\nThe question is what the Cowboys would be getting with Howard who has earned two straight seasons of poor grades in the 50s from Pro Football Focus. Howard received a 55.1 (out of 100) for his play last season. This is significantly down from the 70.9 grade Howard earned two seasons ago in 2021.\n\nBy comparison, Gilmore still earned a respectable 74.4 grade from Pro Football Focus for 2023. Yet, the lack of a new deal shows Dallas is at least considering the possibility of moving on from the former Pro Bowler.\n\nHoward posted 45 tackles and 12 pass deflections in 13 starts during the 2023 season. The veteran has a combined two interceptions over the last two seasons. Howard's best season came in 2020 when the corner posted 51 tackles, 20 pass deflections and led the NFL with 10 interceptions.\n\nIt could be worth the gamble for the Cowboys to sign Howard, but there appears to be a dropoff from the corner compared to what the team was receiving from Gilmore in 2023. The good news for Dallas is the team is expecting the return of Trevon Diggs who missed all but two games with a season-ending ACL injury in 2023. DaRon Bland also emerged as a breakout star during Diggs' absence last season.\n\nDallas' chances of re-signing Gilmore on a team-friendly deal are decreasing as more suitors emerge for the defender.

The former All-pro spoke to reporter Josina Anderson on Thursday about his situation.\n\n\"I'm still focused on playing, but it has to be the right opportunity,\" Gilmore said. \"I feel like it's the age thing with some of these teams.

Gilmore suited up in every game for the first time since his AP Defensive Player of the Year-winning campaign in 2019 when he was a member of the New England Patriots.\n\nHe tallied a career-high 68 tackles (54 solo), two interceptions, 13 passes defensed and one forced fumble. Gilmore earned a 74.4 overall grade, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\nIn his 12 seasons in the league, Gilmore has played for five different teams - the Bills, Patriots, Panthers, Colts and Cowboys. He's won one Super Bowl, earned five Pro Bowl nominations and two first-team All-Pro honors. Gilmore was a first-round draft pick for the Bills in 2012. They took him No. 10 overall out of South Carolina.\n\nHis last deal, which he signed with the Colts, was for two years, $20 million.

He dealt with a foot injury in 2023 and played in just 13 games.\n\nAccording to Tom Pelissero of NFL Network, Howard was fully cleared for football activities in early April.\n\nFour-time Pro Bowl CB Xavien Howard was fully cleared for football activities earlier this month, his doctor informed teams in a letter,\" Pelissero tweeted on April 24. \"Howard, who's a free agent, battled a foot injury throughout last season.

The ballhawk who led the NFL in interceptions in 2018 and 2020 has had just one interception in each of the last two seasons.

Don't let the money get in the way of winning a Super Bowl. Some people get paid, and some people win a Super Bowl. Some people do both.

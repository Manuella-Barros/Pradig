{"id": 231232270, "title": "GOP planning convention 'contingencies' in case Trump is jailed during nomination", "text": "Republican grandees are planning \u201ccontingencies\u201d in the event former President Trump is incarcerated after his sentencing next month, officials and insiders say. Trump will be sentenced by Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan on July 11 after he was convicted of 34 felony counts stemming from hush-money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels. Merchan has a buffet of possible sentences he could impose on the presumptive GOP nominee \u2014 including prison time. The Republican convention in Milwaukee is scheduled to begin on July 15. \u201cI was at a dinner where that question was asked by a donor and RNC staff said that there were contingency plans in place,\u201d said one Trump fund-raiser, who said party officials declined at the time to get into details. \u201cMy understanding is Trump could [accept the nomination] from wherever. Does he physically need to be there? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d One recently-departed official from the Republican National Committee told The Post \u201cmy suspicion of what you do if the guy is actually in jail \u2014 which who knows, right \u2014 I think you probably have him do some kind of video in advance just in case.\u201d One Republican delegate from New York said there had been some chatter about possibly moving up the convention. The idea is discussed as an emergency possibility in the convention rules, adopted in November 2023 \u2014 as Trump\u2019s trial loomed. Trump does not need to be physically present at the convention to accept the nomination, according to multiple insiders. \u201cWe have to be ready for anything,\u201d said RNC co-chair Lara Trump on CNN last week. \u201cWhether its from Trump Tower in Manhattan, whether it\u2019s from Mar-a-Lago, whether it\u2019s from our convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, we will nominate Donald Trump as our Republican nominee and that\u2019s what ultimately matters.\u201d While prison time has been speculated as unlikely \u2014 due to Trump\u2019s advanced age, and his hitherto clean criminal record \u2014 legal insiders close to Trump say it\u2019s not as remote as people think. Allen Weisselberg, former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, was sentenced to five months at Rikers Island by Merchan in January 2023 after pleading guilty to an array of fraud and tax crimes. Weisselberg, 76, also had no prior criminal history. People close to Weisselberg said Merchan made it known it would have been much worse had the defendant not pled guilty and forced a jury to render a verdict \u2014 as Trump did. Weisselberg was cuffed and taken into custody on the day his sentence was handed down. Follow the latest on Donald Trump\u2019s guilty verdict in his hush money trial Trump slams \u2018rigged, disgraceful trial\u2019 in first remarks after guilty verdict in historic hush money case Here\u2019s what happens after Trump\u2019s guilty verdict in \u2018hush money\u2019 trial Trump blasts out fundraising appeal after \u2018hush money\u2019 verdict, says he\u2019s a \u2018political prisoner\u2019 Trump campaign raises whopping $34.8M in six hours after historic \u2018hush money\u2019 conviction Experts split over whether \u2018hush money\u2019 guilty verdict could cost Trump swing states \u201cI could see Merchan saying if the DA\u2019s office asks me for jail then I\u2019ll do jail,\u201d said a person involved in the Weisselberg case. Reps for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg declined to speculate about sentencing. \u201cHaving watched this trial in the courtroom, nothing would truly surprise me,\u201d George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley told The Post. Should Trump be remanded on July 11, his legal team would make an emergency appeal to the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, which could decide to let him out \u2014 but not before he would be forced to spend at least a few hours behind bars. Reps for the Trump campaign refused to speculate \u2014 and were adamant he would show up at the convention in person. Spokesman Steven Chung vowed that \u201cnothing will stop President Trump from accepting the nomination in Milwaukee as planned.\u201d", "summary": "Trump will be sentenced by in New York City on July 11 after he was convicted of 34 felony counts stemming from hush-money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/republicans-seeking-rnc-contingencies-in-case-trump-is-jailed/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/2023-columbia-south-carolina-trump-83373913.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:53:35", "author": "Jon Levine", "authors": ["Jon Levine"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.329}

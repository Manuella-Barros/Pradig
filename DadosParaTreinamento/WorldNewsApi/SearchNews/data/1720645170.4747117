{"id": 231366372, "title": "Coalition bullish and sticks the boot in, saying predictions of SF-led Govt \u2018have been shattered\u2019", "text": "THE THREE COALITION parties are bullishly optimistic at election count centres today with both Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael appearing to hold their vote in early tallies. The Green Party also appears to have done better than expected, though there are concerns being raised about whether the party could lose an MEP. Questions are being asked today around whether Sinn F\u00e9in has run too many candidates across the country. Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe told reporters that early indications are \u201cpositive\u201d for the party, telling reporters that Fine Gael ran a \u201chigh energy\u201d campaign under the new leadership of Simon Harris. In Cabra-Glasnevin, Fine Gael believes it is on track to double its vote versus the last local election, he added. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be, I hope, on the verge of winning a second seat in that ward. So early signs are positive,\u201d he said. War of words Hitting out at Sinn F\u00e9in, he said the party is a \u201cone-trick pony\u201d. \u201cThat one trick isn\u2019t working for them at the moment,\u201d said Donohoe. \u201cBut as I look at all of this, the idea that this is a government and a party that\u2019s running out of steam, that narrative has been shattered by the tallies that are coming through,\u201d he said. The other narrative that has been shattered is that there\u2019s an inevitability about Sinn Fein going into government, said the minister. \u201cHe would say that,\u201d said Dublin Sinn F\u00e9in European election candidate Daith\u00ed Doolan. \u201cThere has been nobody elected here today, no votes have been counted, and here we have Fine Gael yet again, grasping at straws. They are not talking about the housing crisis, they are not talking about the asylum-seeking crisis, they are not talking about the climate crisis, they are talking about Sinn F\u00e9in again, because they are obsessed with us,\u201d said Doolan. He went on to state that he would like to think he is still in with a shot to take a seat in Brussels, but said the priority is for Lynn Boylan to take back a seat in Dublin. Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Daith\u00ed Doolan in response says Paschal Donohoe \u2018would say that\u2019. He says Fine Gael are obsessed with Sinn Fein. pic.twitter.com/tXjzF49EBX\u2014 Christina Finn (@christinafinn8) June 8, 2024 Speaking in Cork today, T\u00e1naiste Miche\u00e1l Martin also seemed cautiously optimistic about Fianna F\u00e1il\u2019s performance. Fianna Fail is doing \u201cfar better\u201d than predicted, he said. He said the party will gain an MEP seat in the Midlands-North-West constituency for the first time in 15 years. \u201cThe idea that Fianna Fail would be coming in a distant third is completely disproven,\u201d the Tanaiste said at Cork City Hall today. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking at opinion polls now for the last three years. This \u2018internet panel\u2019 polling having Fianna Fail at 14% and 15% \u2013 clearly Fianna Fail will be well ahead of that and will be over 20% by the time all of these counts are collated and put together. \u201cWe put up a very robust performance and we\u2019re holding our own compared to our performance in the general election of 2020,\u201d said Martin. He said the focus from this government will now be on producing an \u201ceffective budget\u201d in the autumn, that can deal with housing and helping the elderly in particular. Martin re-committed that the government will \u201cgo full term\u201d and batted of suggestions that there could be an early election. He commented that local elections are not always predictors of the general election.

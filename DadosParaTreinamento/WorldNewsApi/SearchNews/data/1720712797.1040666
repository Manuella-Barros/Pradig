{"id": 232102508, "title": "Biden\u2019s inner circle deeply involved with family\u2019s business dealings: report", "text": "President Biden has long attempted to distance himself from his family\u2019s business dealings as he ran for and eventually became president, but a new report details just how involved those in the president\u2019s inner circle have been in Biden family ventures. Biden has shared a personal bookkeeper with this son, Hunter Biden, a personal lawyer with this brother, Jim Biden, and the former head of then-Vice President Biden\u2019s Secret Service detail helped Jim Biden investigate a potential Chinese business partner, according to a report from Politico. While the Bidens have long said they observe strict \"firewalls\" when it comes to discussing business with each other, the Politico report details just how involved those in the president\u2019s orbit have been in dealings with Hunter and Jim Biden. In one case, the president\u2019s brother, Jim Biden, hired the head of the former vice president\u2019s Secret Service detail, Dale Pupillo, to investigate a Chinese executive the president\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, was traveling to meet in 2017. TOP CHAOTIC MOMENTS FROM THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT HEARING INTO BIDEN FAMILY'S 'INFLUENCE PEDDLING' The president\u2019s brother stressed during the February impeachment inquiry that he personally commissioned the investigation into the executive so that he was not going into the situation blind, but insisted he did not know the details of the potential venture being led by his nephew. \"I wanted to know who I was meeting with and if there were any complications at all,\" he said at the impeachment interview, noting that it was common in the Biden family to keep the details of business dealings away from each other. The executive, Patrick Ho, was later arrested and convicted on federal corruption charges. The Politico report notes that Jim Biden had a long habit of tapping those connected to his powerful older brother. In one case, in 1975, during Joe Biden\u2019s first Senate term, Jim Biden secured a loan from the senator\u2019s old law firm, Walsh, Monzack & Owens, to help fund his nightclub business. One of those partners, Mel Monzack, has gone on to serve as the president\u2019s personal attorney and campaign treasurer. Monzack\u2019s current firm has also served as the registered agent for the president\u2019s personal S Corporation, CelticCapri, which handles income from activities such as writing and speaking fees. GOP LAWMAKER SAYS REPUBLICANS \u2018DON\u2019T HAVE THE GUTS\u2019 TO IMPEACH BIDEN Monzack has also served as Jim Biden\u2019s personal attorney, helping to negotiate a proposed deal that would have given the president\u2019s brother\u2019s company a 35% stake in the Americore hospital chain. While the deal fell through, Monzack\u2019s involvement raised questions, though Jim Biden has insisted he does not have knowledge of the attorney\u2019s arrangement with President Biden. \"I don\u2019t have the full depth of what he does or doesn\u2019t do,\" he said in February. \"But I know that he\u2019s intricately involved and has been, you know, for the last 40 or 50 years.\" Another close associate of President Biden, body man Fran Person, stayed involved with Hunter Biden after leaving government in 2014. Emails showed that Person, who the Bidens have said became like a son to them over the course of Joe Biden\u2019s service in the Senate and as vice president, pitched Hunter Biden on a plan to develop SeaWorld parks in China in a deal between Person\u2019s business and the state-owned Chinese Development Bank in 2015. WhatsApp messages that were revealed as part of an IRS investigation into Hunter Biden\u2019s tax matters also showed conversations between Person and Hunter Biden, including conversations in which Person told Hunter Biden his Chinese business partner, Bo Zhang, was eager to help the president\u2019s son overcome his growing financial troubles. GOP LAWMAKER SAYS REPUBLICANS \u2018DON\u2019T HAVE THE GUTS\u2019 TO IMPEACH BIDEN The Politico report also detailed the role another Hunter Biden business partner, personal bookkeeper Eric Schwerin, played in the family, with President Biden leaning on the bookkeeper to handle his own finances. Nevertheless, Schwerin testified during the impeachment inquiry that there was no intermingling between the president and his son\u2019s finances. The connection between the president\u2019s orbit and his family even extended to President Biden\u2019s personal physician, Army doctor Kevin O\u2019Connor. O\u2019Connor served as then-Vice President Biden\u2019s personal physician and grew close to Biden throughout his time in the Biden administration. The doctor now serves as Biden\u2019s White House physician, the report notes.

Throughout the investigation, 16 individuals were found guilty of bribery, embezzlement, and participating in an organized crime group, resulting in fines and soccer bans.\n\nThe scandal came to light in October 2020 when Czech police conducted raids in connection with a corruption and match-fixing investigation, targeting referees and soccer officials. Berbr, who subsequently resigned, was held in custody for three months and has pleaded not guilty.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspended_sentence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suspended sentence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Association_of_the_Czech_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Football Association of the Czech Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_fixing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Match fixing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embezzlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Embezzlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scandal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_koruna", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Czech koruna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Slavoj_Vy\u0161ehrad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Slavoj Vy\u0161ehrad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plze\u0148", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plze\u0148"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Plze\u0148"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_of_the_Czech_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police of the Czech Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Organized crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Academic_Study", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Academic Study", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Officiating", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/AdminFiles/UserFiles/22_11_2018_14_00_28_6024474.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664833", "eventUri": "eng-9664833", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-10-", "textStart": 1276, "textEnd": 1288}], "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

Whether it\u2019s concerns about a looming recession\u2014the so-called \u201cvibecession\u201d we talked about last week\u2014or worries that life is getting too expensive because of inflation, there\u2019s a growing bias toward doom-and-gloom. Plus, pessimistic people tend to sound serious\u2014and for many pundits, parroting these arguments is easier than actually analyzing data. At CEF Insider, we remain 100% data-driven, for the simple reason that it\u2019s profitable. After all, the doom-and-gloom was at a fever pitch in late 2022, and we all know how stocks have done since. (As we\u2019ll discuss below, there are two CEFs that benefit from the disconnect between the media narrative and the real facts, including an 8.9% payer that\u2019s cheap now). And we\u2019ve got yet another data point that pushes back against the doom-and-gloomers: Workers in America are doing really well. America\u2019s 3.9% unemployment rate is historically very low, and it\u2019s the opposite of what one expects in a recession, so this alone belies the argument that we\u2019re in a \u201cvibecession.\u201d In fact, the \u201cvibecession\u201d is probably more the result of a growing number of job losses in sectors like media, technology and finance (those that tend to capture the attention of the media, in other words!). But for the folks who do the physical work on the ground\u2014the nurses, shopkeepers, police and others who were rightly called \u201cessential\u201d during the pandemic\u2014demand hasn\u2019t decreased at all. This isn\u2019t just \u201cvibes,\u201d either. A recent study by Vanguard has shown that hiring is increasing for blue-collar workers, including those lower on the income scale.

The demand for people who are good at physical tasks is so strong we\u2019re now hearing reports of housekeepers in wealthier areas earning $150,000 per year. That\u2019s more than a first-year investment banker makes! And since these workers spend a larger portion of their income on goods and services in what you might call the \u201creal\u201d economy, this has been great news overall. It\u2019s a big part of the reason why the S&P 500 is up over 50% in less than two years. How to Invest as the \u201cReal\u201d Economy Grinds Higher Here\u2019s the takeaway for us as investors: We\u2019re not too late to buy into this growth. And if you\u2019ve booked a nice gain in the last couple of years, now is a great time to turn that upside into income. The key is to do this through closed-end funds (CEFs). We love CEFs chiefly because of their large income streams, which average 8.3% today. That amounts to $680 per month for every $100,000 invested, which is incredible when you realize the stock market gets you just a bit over $100 a month for the same amount. But nowadays we\u2019re especially focused on CEFs\u2019 outsized discounts to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios). Across the board, CEFs are now at an average 6.7% discount, and here\u2019s what most folks don\u2019t realize about that figure: It results in a yield on NAV of 7.8%, or what management needs to earn to get us that 8.3% payout, which is based on the discounted market price. That 6.7% discount is actually a bit smaller than the longer-term CEF average, but that\u2019s mostly because of a skew resulting from about 15% of the CEFs tracked by CEF Insider that boast absurdly high premiums to NAV, like the Calamos Convertible Opportunities and Income Fund (CHI), which trades at a 15.9% premium, mainly because investors are drawn in by its 10% yield. Add to that the fact that CHI\u2019s dividend hasn\u2019t been cut since the 2008/2009 Great Recession and the thirst for this fund makes a lot of sense. But not everything is rosy at CHI. There\u2019s that premium, for one\u2014you\u2019ll need to pay about $1.16 for every $1.00 of assets in CHI\u2019s portfolio. Compare that to the Virtus Equity & Convertible Income Fund (NIE), whose shares trade for 10% less than their assets are worth, so $1.00 of assets here costs just $0.90. Everyone likes a good deal, but NIE isn\u2019t better just because it\u2019s cheaper. It\u2019s also better because it has a stronger performance history. NIE Outperforms CHI Ycharts If you\u2019d put $100,000 in NIE a decade ago, you\u2019d now have $278,600, while CHI investors would have $214,900, over $60,000 less. What about income? NIE\u2019s 8.9% dividend yield isn\u2019t as generous as that of CHI, but it\u2019s still huge, getting us $745 at a monthly pace per $100,000 invested, plus strong total returns. Of course, both funds (and plenty of other CEFs) are money-makers now that stocks are likely to keep rising thanks to the strong labor market\u2014particularly for workers we see out there every day in America. And while many \u201cho-hum\u201d CEFs will still get us a solid income stream in an environment like this, the best ones will get us 8.9% yields, like NIE, and stronger gains, too.

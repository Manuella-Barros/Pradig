Having an estimated household income of over $150,000 and a median net worth of $805,400 (per 2021 Census data) means that upper-class Americans can afford a lot more car and have a lot more options than those who make far less.

For drivers expecting a the best, the X5\u2019s ride is remarkably smooth, stable and comfortable, and the opulent interior is whisper silent. Genesis G90 Starting MSRP: $89,200 The cheaper G70 and G80 are both excellent cars, but the G90 is in a class of its own. Despite unimpressive fuel economy and acceleration, MotorTrend feels Genesis\u2019 flagship model excels in every area. It looks great, has a wide range of features, offers world-class ride quality and silent comfort. The interior design is tastefully and functionally organized. The lounge-like rear seating area is a dream for passengers. Jaguar XF Starting MSRP: $49,800 With plenty of storage capacity and a variety of engine options, the Jaguar XF is a sophisticated and powerful midsize luxury sedan. Its quiet cabin makes it a good daily commuter and country cruiser, even though it is not as performant or state-of-the-art as some of its German rivals, like the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and BMW 5 Series. Kia EV9 Starting MSRP: $56,395 Kia? Upper-class car? Perhaps not, but that\u2019s an upper-class price tag for a very good EV. While the big automakers are trying to catch Tesla, Kia is distancing itself and \u201ckilling it with EVs,\u201d claims Motor1. \u201cThe Kia EV9 has the three-row EV market all to its own. It goes to show just how far ahead of the curve the Korean brand is,\u201d said the site. The EV9 is perfect for an American upper-class household that likes the look of owning an electric vehicle over that of a prestigious brand symbol. Lexus LS Starting MSRP: $80,865 Jumping up a little in price, the Lexus LS has fallen behind competitors in some experts\u2019 eyes. However, For a stress-free driving experience, the 2024 LS raises the standard for the ultra-luxury sedan class with its comfort, quietness and unmatched build quality. It might not have the most horsepower in its class or the technological prowess of its leading rivals, but with semi-autonomous safety features, the car all but drives itself. Mercedes-Benz CLE-class Starting MSRP: $56,500 As Car and Driver notes, the 2024 Mercedes-Benz CLE-class blended its old C-class and E-class models when it trimmed its lineup. Although it\u2019s more opulent than its rivals \u2014 the Audi A5 and the BMW 4-series \u2014 the CLE outdoes both in cost too. That\u2019s an unfortunate part of owning a Benz. Mercedes\u2019 CLE-class has two powertrain options, is available as a \u201cslick two-door coupe or convertible form factor\u201d and has a ton of standard cabin technology. Porsche 718 Cayman/Boxster Starting MSRPs: $68,300/$70,400 These two 718 models share the same superior engine, produce the same excellent horsepower, torque and performance numbers and have the same dimensions. And both will cost you around $70,000, which is not bad considering Porsches are persuasive upper-class lures due to their iconic status and luxe looks. Volvo S60 Starting MSRP: $43,645 Known for it excellent safety ratings and practicality, Volvo\u2019s sedans are also comfortable. The S60 in particular has a sophisticated interior (\u201cThe interior design is unique, and the materials are lovely, especially with the optional Nappa leather or wool blend,\u201d says Kelley Blue Book) and a subtlety sporty yet quiet ride. KBB also likes some of the S60\u2019s standard features, like the panoramic roof and Google-based infotainment system.

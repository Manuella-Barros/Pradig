{"id": 231301306, "title": "Famed east Vancouver sushi restaurant Koko to close after 42 years", "text": "When the Milnes arrived Wednesday for lunch, they were greeted by a packed house. When word leaked out the restaurant was closing on social media, Koko was flooded with calls, and it\u2019s booked straight through to closing day. \u201cSomebody leaked it on the social media thing that we were closing down, and after that the phone has just been going off the hook,\u201d said Shimamura. \u201cI didn\u2019t like that, because then it squeezes out my regular customers who want to come.\u201d Shimamura is incredibly fast at making sushi, but this week he seemed to be at warp speed, trying to keep up with the demand. \u201cThe key of being fast? You look at the customers and they look at you with their hungry faces,\u201d he laughed. \u201c(But) being one person you can only do so much.\u201d Koko used to have two sushi chefs, but Shimamura has been working solo since the pandemic. The restaurant was shut down for much of COVID, because he only wanted to do in-person dining. \u201cDoing takeout, it\u2019s no fun,\u201d he said. \u201cYou make the food, someone comes picks it up, bye bye, that\u2019s it.\u201d Shimamura is a very friendly fellow, with an easy laugh. So is his wife Shizue, who is one of the waitresses.", "summary": "Restaurant was opened by the legendary sushi chef Koji Shimamura, and for the last three decades have been run by his son Kuni", "url": "https://vancouversun.com/life/food/vancouver-sushi-restaurant-koko-closing", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/vancouversun/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/png0605-koko-6.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:00:34", "author": "John Mackie", "authors": ["John Mackie"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": -0.352}

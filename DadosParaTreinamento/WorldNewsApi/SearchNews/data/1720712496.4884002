Despite this, some have reported issues with this simple practice. For example, one internet user claimed that her father\u2019s pharmacist refused to fill his prescription because they disagreed with the prescribed dosage. Another alleged that a pharmacy would not let him fill a prescription for Adderall because he didn\u2019t have insurance. Given these issues, one may wonder what goes on behind a pharmacy counter that could lead to these outcomes. Now, TikTok user Danielle (@dirtydan777) has an answer. Why your prescription may take a while In a video with over 575,000 views as of Sunday, Danielle recounts an experience she had while working at a pharmacy. \u201cToday this girl asked me to fill a prescription for her. So I said, \u2018Of course, babe\u2026Do you want to wait for it?\u2019 And she was like, \u2018Yeah,\u2019 so I was like, \u2018OK, probably 10 or 15 minutes,\u2019\u201d Danielle recalls. \u201cSister really turns to me [and] goes. \u2018Oh, well, what do you have to do? Cuz isn\u2019t it just in a box?\u2019\u201d According to Danielle, this represents a major misunderstanding about what people behind the pharmacy counter actually do. Danielle says that even small items that are typically available over the counter, such as tampons, must be assessed by the main pharmacist\u2014\u201daka the pharmacist who has the malpractice insurance,\u201d explains Danielle. Next, Danielle says that every medication she provides to customers must be logged into their computer system, which Danielle says is slow. \u201cBecause when the drug company calls and says, \u2018Oh this drug is recalled because there\u2019s shards of glass in it,\u2019 I\u2019m gonna need to go back into your file and make sure that yours didn\u2019t have that. You know what I mean?\u201d she adds. As a result, Danielle says that there\u2019s much more that someone behind a pharmacy counter does beyond simply handing over a box. The Mayo Clinic notes that a pharmacy technician may also be involved in other tasks, such as \u201cprocessing insurance claims, tracking inventory, and filing paperwork.\u201d @dirtydan777 i hate a stupid ah question \u266c original sound \u2013 Dirtydan Viewers had no idea In the comments section, many users admitted that they were unaware of just how much needs to be done before a prescription can be handed over. \u201cThank you for explaining, cause I would never argue about the time it takes, but it\u2019s been a mystery why it takes so long,\u201d a user wrote. \u201cI thought it took 15+ mins for them to find the meds and then put them in the bottle,\u201d added another. Other users cited additional issues that could lead to long medication fill times. \u201cNot to mention most pharmacies are extremely short staffed rn with 1-2 people having to work the front counter, drive through, answer phones, answer questions, fill 100s of other medications that [are] before theirs plus the other waiters that are probably before her, do stock, truck, orders, etccc,\u201d detailed a commenter. \u201cI went to Thailand 2 months ago and needed to get shots before going, the pharmacist I went to spent half an hour researching to see if I needed anything specific to the areas I was going to,\u201d recalled a second. \u201cPeople really need to have some more patience\u2026a pharmacy is not McDonald\u2019s.\u201d The Daily Dot reached out to Danielle via email.

That's not really up for debate at this point.\n\nShe's eclipsed her own world record the last five times she's run at a championship-level event, including the U.S. Olympic Trials last month where she ran it in 50.65 seconds.\n\nShe could do it an unprecedented sixth time and clear the 50-second mark in the process during the 400m hurdles final at the Paris Olympics on Thursday.\n\nThat would be incredible, yet somehow feel so, so incomplete.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone made her debut at the 2016 Rio Olympics while still enrolled at Union Catholic Regional High School in Dunellen, N.J. At age 17, that made her the youngest U.S. Olympian in track and field since 1972.\n\nIt still feels like McLaughlin-Levrone is just scraping the surface of her tremendous potential. She should be the kind of transcendent track athlete who is remembered long past her days of competing.\n\nJust running the hurdles won't elevate her in that manner.\n\nShe needs to break away from only competing in her signature event and take on a bigger challenge.\n\nU.S. sprinter Noah Lyles provided a blueprint. Track stars in the states usually only get mainstream attention every four years when the Olympics roll around. Lyles was determined to increase his profile and part of his plan included taking on a bold persona that drew the ire of NBA players when he declared they shouldn't be called world champions for winning NBA titles.\n\nFortunately, McLaughlin-Levrone doesn't have to duplicate his brash-talking part of the plan. But she'd be smart to follow what Lyles has done on the track.\n\nLyles' strength is in the 200m dash. He could have dominated that alone and stuck with it exclusively, but decided he needed to earn the title of 'Fastest man on the planet' by running the 100m too.\n\nIt took some time for him to master it, and he still has trouble getting out of the blocks, but as he proved in Paris, he's the best at it.\n\nLyles won gold in the 100m in a photo finish that will be remembered for ages. If he goes on to win the 200m and hops on a relay team or two, Lyles could start dreaming of one day entering Carl Lewis territory for how he will be respected.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone could be more than respected, she could be revered. There's nothing we love in sports more than someone doing something that's never been done before.\n\nShe originally intended to compete in both the 200m and 400m in addition to 400m hurdles, before announcing in July she'd concentrate just on the hurdles. The 400 flat and hurdles schedule overlapped taking that out of play. She didn't express why she decided against the 200m.\n\nImagine the uproar for an athlete who could win gold medals in all three events. The fact that it seems entirely feasible she could pull that off speaks to her unique talent.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone has teasingly shown how gifted she is. She ran the 200m back in May at the LA Grand Prix in 22.07 seconds.\n\nIt was a personal best and it would have been good enough to place second behind American Gabby Thomas' gold medal winning time of 21.83 seconds in Paris.\n\nIn June, McLaughlin-Levrone ran the 400m flat in 48.75 seconds at the NYC Grand Prix, which is the third fastest time in U.S. track history and the second fastest time this year behind Jamaica's Nickisha Pryce (48.57).\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone celebrated her 25th birthday in Paris on Wednesday. By the time she hits 29 and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics rolls around, she could be considered the greatest sprinter ever.\n\nIf only she steps outside of the hurdles to earn the title.", "source":

McLaughlin-Levrone is the reigning Summer Games champion and keeps breaking the world record, over and over; Bol is the reigning world champ -- it probably helped that the American was injured and not there -- and already picked up a gold in Paris with a terrific last leg for the Dutch in the 4x400-meter mixed relay on Saturday.\n\nSo far, McLaughlin-Levrone is 2-0 against Bol, beating her at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, then again at 2022 world championships.\n\n\"Iron sharpens iron,\" McLaughlin-Levrone said Tuesday night at Stade de France after each woman won her semifinal heat to qualify for the medal race. \"It's always fun racing the best, and I know we're going to push each other.\"\n\nThere certainly was no pushing going on during the semifinals.\n\nMcLaughin-Levrone eased up quite a bit down the stretch and still finished 1.7 seconds in front of the running-up, clocking 52.13. How swift is that? That would have broken the world record of 52.16 that was held by another U.S. runner, Dalilah Muhammad, before the New Jersey-born McLaughlin-Levrone began lowering the mark regularly.\n\nShe initially took it down to 51.90 in 2021, and then broke it four more times to get it to the current standard of 50.65, which arrived at the U.S. Olympic trials in June.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone's heat came first, and Bol was asked whether she watched her rival run.\n\n\"Only on the screen, quickly. I mainly focus on my own race,\" Bol said. \"And to be fair, you can't really get much out of (watching) semifinals anyway.\"\n\nBol was first across the line in hers Tuesday in a time of 52.57.\n\n\"Hopefully, I'll be ... in the best form and shape of my life\" for the final, Bol said. \"We'll see in two days' time.\"\n\n(The Associated Press contributed to this report).", "source": {"uri": "nj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_McLaughlin-Levrone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/400_metres_hurdles", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "400 metres hurdles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femke_Bol", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Femke Bol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalilah_Muhammad", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dalilah Muhammad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/N7Q32DPUPVGPRH77HHPUNVCKGU.JPG?auth=2ec6340bea72c538cfa520ca057af39e200778b4bbaae1274c5a44a2a215ca14&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801206", "eventUri": "eng-9801206", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Grab the baton and split sub-48 seconds on the anchor leg of a 4x400m relay? No worries. Leave world-class women trailing in a different postcode as you ease across the line in an Olympic 400m hurdles semi-final in a time of just over 52 seconds, which would have been a world record just five years ago? Grandest.\n\nBut what they are doing is not easy, and it's never been anything remotely like achievable for anyone else besides these two. They are absolute outliers. Two global champions. Two world record holders.\n\nAt the Stade de France in Paris tonight, fans of athletics - and of the Olympics in general - will get to savour one of the greatest head-to-head clashes of these Games. The women's 400m hurdles final goes to the line at 8.25pm Irish time. Don't miss it.\n\nGiven it's one of the sport's top rivalries, it's strange to think they've actually only raced twice. That's it. In the Olympic final in Tokyo, McLaughlin-Levrone smashed the world record with 51.46 to win gold, Bol finishing third in 52.03.\n\nThe other time was in the 2022 world final in Oregon, McLaughlin-Levrone ascending to a whole new level, clocking a mind-boggling 50.68 to win by a street ahead of Bol (52.27). McLaughlin-Levrone missed last year's World Champs in Budapest due to a knee injury and Bol finally got the title her talent and ability long deserved, powering to gold in 51.70.\n\nBol is 24, McLaughlin-Levrone is 25, and both come in in the form of their lives.\n\nOn the track tonight, there will likely not be much separating them. McLaughlin-Levrone is the undoubted favourite, having broken her own world record to win the US title in June with 50.65. That weekend, many fans were essentially hanging the Olympic gold medal around her neck.\n\nBut then Bol went to La Chaux-de-Fonds in late July, a town in Switzerland synonymous with fast times due to it sitting at almost 1000m of altitude. She smashed the European record there, going under 51 seconds for the first time with 50.95. Suddenly, she was looming large in Sydney's rear-view mirror.\n\nThe certainty was no more. The aura of invincibility may still follow in the scorching slipstream of McLaughlin-Levrone, but it's affixed with an awareness that one slight error, one tactical misjudgement or one clipped hurdle or moment of mental fragility will be seized upon and devoured by her greatest - and in truth her only - rival.\n\nThey have vastly different approaches to the sport, even if their profiles and performances are strikingly similar.\n\nBol likes to race - a lot. Her coach Laurent Meuwly clearly subscribes to the theory that peaking for one event is not mutually exclusive from running many others on the way there. He doesn't wrap Bol in cotton wool. She ran 29 races last year: on the flat, over hurdles, indoors, outdoors, relays. She is accessible. She is present. She is there from Continental Tours to Diamond Leagues to nationals to major championships. It's why she's the undoubted fan favourite.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone, however, doesn't like to race a lot. Or more accurately: her coach Bobby Kersee doesn't like her to race a lot. Her preternatural talent - which revealed itself in her early teens, when she set age world bests all the way up along during her adolescence - is kept wrapped up for so much of the year by Kersee, who has eyes only for one prize: the major championship.\n\nTo him, nothing else matters. Would it be nice if fans got to see more of one of the sport's A-list stars? Sure, but in Kersee's mind, a strained hamstring or a clattered hurdle is not worth the risk. And anyway, why is it his or her responsibility to grow the sport? Don't her performances already do that? Isn't her job - the one she's paid a whopping amount of money to do by New Balance - to go and win Olympic gold? Absolutely.\n\nAnd if that means she has shown up at a grand total of one Diamond League meeting - the sport's top professional circuit - over the last four years? Well, that's someone else's problem.\n\nStill, visibility earns you fans, and for years there's been a marked difference in how they have viewed both McLaughlin-Levrone and Bol. After the semi-finals two nights ago, I put a poll up on Twitter/X to ask who would win the final. It got close to 2,000 votes, with 53% going for Sydney and 47% for Femke.\n\nTo me, many were choosing the result they wanted to see rather than the one they likely will see. But the great thing about this race? We just don't know. Bol split a terrifying 47.93 on the anchor leg of the mixed 4x400m relay last Saturday to carry the Dutch to gold. She's never been in form quite like this before.\n\nTo try to close the gap on her rival, she and her coach rebuilt her entire race approach last year. She now runs with 14 strides (instead of 15) to the seventh hurdle, each of them about 12cm longer than they used to be. With McLaughlin-Levrone around, they had no choice. It was either find a way to run faster or accept that you'll only be running for silver.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone's best split in a 4x400m relay? The 47.91 she ran to anchor USA to women's 4x400m gold in Oregon two years ago, just two hundredths of a second faster than Bol the other night.\n\nThey look well matched even if, on recent form, McLaughlin-Levrone should just about have enough to shade it. But there is massive pressure on the shoulders of the US star and that can do strange things to an athlete. Bol has been building to this moment for years, making herself strong enough and fast enough and so technically proficient that she can finally take a realistic shot at the queen of her event.\n\nAthletes like this don't come along often. Clashes like this are even rarer. And so whatever way this goes, it's best to savour every second.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Please try again later.\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France -- In the span of 75 furious minutes Thursday night, over the course of three races lasting a total of 82 seconds or so, the long history of American track and field may reach a new pinnacle.\n\nThere are single performances (Michael Johnson, Atlanta, 1996) and full Olympic programs (Jesse Owens, Berlin, 1936; Wilma Rudolph, Rome, 1960; Carl Lewis, Los Angeles, 1984) that own darn-near untouchable places in the annals. But there probably has never been a constellation of American athletes to grace an Olympic track in back-to-back-to-back succession like the one Stade de France will witness Thursday night.\n\nIn an Olympic meet the United States has owned, the climax is about to arrive. At 8:30 p.m. local time, Noah Lyles will try to win the second of three -- or could it be four? -- Paris Olympics gold medals, this one in the 200 meters, his signature event. At 9:25, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone will glide in the 400 hurdles, in which breaking her own world record has become a ritual. At 9:45, in the night's finale, Grant Holloway will attempt to win his first Olympic gold in the 110 hurdles, a race in which he has flirted with the world record for three dominant years.\n\nIt's a marquee USA Track & Field would dream up: three likely gold medals and two possible world records, wrapped in the showmanship of Lyles, the regality of McLaughlin-Levrone and the mastery of Holloway.\n\nThe sound check provided a surprise. Lyles finished second to Botswanan Letsile Tebogo on Wednesday in his 200-meter semifinal, his first loss at the distance since the Tokyo Olympics. Lyles never reached top gear and slowed in the final 20 meters, crossing in 20.08 seconds, content to conserve energy for the final rather than chase Tebogo. Lyles's coach, Lance Brauman, said Lyles was \"fine\" physically. Lyles proved in the 100 that he can win after a preliminary yawn. The result, though, will affect his lane position for the final.\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\nGet the latest updates on the 2024 Olympics\n\n(Washington Post illustration)\n\nTrack all the Paris Olympic medal counts country by country, and see the breakdown of medals by U.S. athletes. Get live updates from Paris and keep up with the latest by signing up for The Sports Moment: Olympics Edition.\n\nEnd of carousel\n\nNBC analyst Ato Boldon has been to nine Summer Olympics, four as a sprinter representing Trinidad and Tobago and five as a broadcaster. His standout night came on \"Super Saturday\" during London 2012, when Britain's Mo Farah (5,000), Greg Rutherford (long jump) and Jessica Ennis (heptathlon) won gold medals across 45 minutes, creating a sound that nearly knocked down Olympic Stadium.\n\n\"That's considered the greatest sports night in British history,\" Boldon said. \"This is going to match it.\"\n\nIt starts with Lyles's historic pursuit. Coming off his exhilarating victory in the 100 and aiming for his second gold, he will be a massive favorite in a race he had won 27 consecutive times before Wednesday. The United States also will be a heavy favorite in the 4x100 relay Friday, when Lyles presumably will run the third leg, allowing him to accelerate around the curve.\n\nBoldon, as savvy and plugged-in as anyone in track and field, does not believe Lyles's Olympics will end there.\n\n\"If Noah gets three golds, do you think USA Track & Field is going to sit him in the stands to watch the 4x400?\" Boldon said. \"Because I don't.\"\n\nLyles raised the idea of four golds last year, but most interpreted it as bluster given his lack of experience at 400 meters. Even he dismissed the idea last week. Given the possibility of a fourth gold, Lyles's decision to run a U.S. leg of the 4x400 relay at the world indoor championships in March carries fresh intrigue. The men's 4x400 will be run Saturday night, the penultimate event at Stade de France.\n\n\"If he leaves here with four gold medals, to me he goes into American history with Jesse, Carl and Michael,\" Boldon said. \"How could he not?\"\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone, voted a captain by U.S. teammates, already owns a piece of that history. Like Swedish pole vault maestro Armand \"Mondo\" Duplantis, McLaughlin-Levrone hovers above her competition. She has broken the world record five times since 2021, at every national or global competition she has been healthy. She lowered it to 50.65 seconds at June's U.S. trials on a day she expected to run in the 50.80s.\n\n\"The world record is gone,\" Boldon said. \"Sydney hasn't broken her pattern since 2021.\"\n\nThis time, McLaughlin-Levrone may have to. Last month, Dutchwoman Femke Bol destroyed a 400 hurdles field in 50.95 seconds, a time just 0.30 behind McLaughlin-Levrone's record that made Bol the second-fastest 400 hurdler ever. Bol has focused her training on a more aggressive first 200 meters, and she showcased her all-time kick with an epic anchor-leg comeback that gave the Netherlands gold in the 4x400 mixed relay.\n\n\"Bol is going to be a lot closer than people think,\" Boldon said.\n\nShe and McLaughlin-Levrone could cook up a replica of the men's 400 hurdles final in Tokyo, when American Rai Benjamin broke Norwegian Karsten Warholm's world record but finished second as Warholm shattered it by a greater margin in the lane next to him.\n\n\"We know it's going to take a world record,\" McLaughlin-Levrone said.\n\nHolloway, too, knows about sour silver medals. In Tokyo, a month after he came within 0.01 seconds of the world record in a U.S. Olympic trials semifinal heat, Holloway stormed to a massive lead in the 110 hurdles final. He landed awkwardly over the seventh hurdle, lost the lead, watched Jamaican Hansle Parchment cross the line first and took silver.\n\nplayPlay now\n\nNaN min\n\nFollow on\n\nPodcast episode\n\nSpotify\n\nApple\n\nGoogle\n\nAmazon\n\nHolloway has dominated since, winning the past two world championships to give him three in his career. Fellow U.S. athletes view Holloway as one of the best at what he does; they voted him team captain. He will launch another assault on Aries Merritt's world record of 12.80 seconds Thursday, a day after a blowout semifinal victory in 12.98. Holloway, as charismatic of a performer as there is at Stade de France, is thinking only about the one prize he does not have.\n\n\"You guys think about Tokyo a lot, but we're in Paris,\" Holloway said. \"I'm looking forward to continuing to show the great form that I'm in. ... Everybody is talking about a world record. If it comes, it comes. The first thing we have to take care of is winning.\"\n\nHolloway will be the final American star on the track Thursday night. He may be riding a wave of noise from the races preceding him. If Stade de France roared during an opening morning of qualifiers, how will it sound after consecutive performances from three all-time athletes in their discipline?\n\n\"It's electric right now,\" said Jasmine Jones, who will run alongside McLaughlin-Levrone in the 400 hurdles final. \"That night is going to be completely magical.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news",

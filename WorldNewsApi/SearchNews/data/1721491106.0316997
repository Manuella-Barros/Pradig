{"id": 237096680, "title": "Microsoft has limited exposure to China, but US lawmakers still raise questions", "text": "American tech giant Microsoft has come under the spotlight amid rising geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington, as US lawmakers questioned the company over its ties to the world\u2019s second largest economy. Brad Smith, Microsoft president since 2015, disclosed that China only accounted for around 1.5 per cent of its global revenue, but said there are reasons for the company to stay even as the size of its mainland-based engineering team has been reduced. The reasons for Microsoft to continue its China operations were \u201cto protect American information and trade secrets of American companies who are doing business in China\u201d and to \u201censure that [it is] always learning from what\u2019s going on in the rest of the world\u201d, Smith said last week during congressional testimony over computer hacks last year that were linked to China. The hearings, where Smith had to assure lawmakers that US national security was being protected as part of its involvement in China tech development, reflect how growing bilateral tensions are impacting American businesses. The tensions are \u201clikely to continue for a long time, which will be a tremendously negative backdrop for US tech companies investing in China\u201d, said He Jun, senior researcher at Beijing-based think tank Ambound. During the testimony, Smith was asked about his promise to \u201cactively participate in the digital transformation of China\u2019s economy\u201d, an indirect quote published by China\u2019s commerce ministry and attributed to Smith during his visit to the country in December. Smith told the hearings that the words were \u201cnot [his] statement\u201d. Smith said there were areas in China deemed by Microsoft as \u201cappropriate and important\u201d to participate in, but that he did not use the words in the quote. However, the quote and Smith\u2019s visit to China were widely reported by local media as Beijing seeks to lure more foreign investment in the country. \u201cIt\u2019s been increasingly hard for American companies to operate in China given the rising geopolitical tension between the two countries,\u201d said Thomas Liu, founder and CEO of the consultancy Policy Nexus. \u201cBut in the long run, China and the US will benefit from cooperating with each other rather than a conflict.\u201d Even while maintaining its presence on the mainland, Microsoft has been reducing its China-based engineering team. Smith confirmed that the company is offering to relocate 700 to 800 employees from it China operations overseas. The Post reported in May that some local staff, including those from the Azure cloud computing unit, were offered new work locations such as the US, Australia and Ireland. Separately, Microsoft announced plans last week to invest US$7.2 billion to develop new data centres in Spain, making it a major cloud computing hub in Europe. Ambound\u2019s He said Microsoft still has advantages in staying in China. \u201cWhen [Microsoft founder] Bill Gates came to China [last June], the nation\u2019s president [Xi Jinping] met him. Will Microsoft give up this good \u2018soft power\u2019 and reputation to dance to the demands of American politicians?\u201d", "summary": "Microsoft has come under the spotlight amid rising geopolitical tensions, as US lawmakers questioned the company over its ties to the world\u2019s second largest economy.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3266974/microsoft-has-limited-exposure-china-us-lawmakers-still-raise-questions", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/06/17/65f7ddb6-786f-407e-a859-15fef00a7b13_ed241f8c.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 01:00:09", "author": "Coco Feng", "authors": ["Coco Feng"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": -0.292}

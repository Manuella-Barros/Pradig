The model, 32, ensured all eyes were on her as she donned a minuscule bikini top that barely contained her ample assets. Getting into the Formula One spirit, she layered a black and white leather racing jacket over the top, left unbuttoned to keep her cleavage on display. She added a pair of matching trousers with red stitching, slung low on her hips to showcase her incredibly toned midriff and flash a glimpse at her bikini bottoms. Emily completed her fashion forward look with pointed grey high heels, while hiding behind a pair of oversized black sunglasses. Her latest daring look comes just weeks after her show-stopping appearance at the Met Gala, which saw her go braless and flaunt her bottom in a sheer gown. Her head-turning frock was an openly woven silver lace creation by Atelier Versace, a vintage piece from the fall 2001 couture collection. Emily's decision to wear a retro piece was in keeping with the Met Gala's theme, which was inspired by the JG Ballard short story The Garden Of Time. While posing up a storm on the red carpet, Emily swung around to reveal that the flesh-flashing frock was backless. 'I'm very naked, but what else is new?' she joked to Vogue, describing her ensemble as being 'kind of all about the back, which is like nonexistent.' Although she has now attended nine Met Galas, she confessed that she still feels under 'pressure' before attending the ultra-glamorous event. 'I have worn things that I have not felt comfortable in, and I do feel that it shows. Maybe it shows in the way that I choose my hair and makeup, or the way I pose, or whatever,' she reflected tot he New York Times. However, Emily had no such compunctions about this year's vintage Versace, which she said 'feels really natural on me - comfortable, truly.' She was also conscious of the theme, Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion, saying: 'I just wanted to feel like I was wearing something that could be in the exhibit'. The My Body author recently revealed she's not focused on finding a partner right now, as she opened up about her dating life. Speaking on the New York Times podcast Modern Love earlier this month, Emily - who shares three-year-old son Sylvester with ex-husband Sebastian Bear-McClard - said: 'I take care of so much in my life. 'I take care of my son, I take care of my home, I take care of my schedule, his schedule, my career. The burden of the finances is on me and I don't have a family supporting me financially or any of that.' She continued: 'I often think about how much I want to be taken care of and I experience that with my female friendships in different ways. 'I have wonderful, wonderful friends who do know when to take care of me and how to take care of me.' Emily added: 'It feels really hard to imagine somebody who's more capable than me or who could understand my needs in that way.", "summary": "The model, 32, ensured all eyes were on her as she donned a minuscule bikini top that barely contained her ample assets.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13461531/Emily-Ratajkowski-showcases-cleavage-toned-midriff-skimpy-bikini-racing-jacket-attends-F1-Grand-Prix-Monaco.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/26/16/85352871-0-image-m-24_1716736761418.jpg", "video": "https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/05/07/2729913573529074878/1024x576_MP4_2729913573529074878.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:51:39", "author": "Editor,Milly Veitch", "authors": ["Editor", "Milly Veitch"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.166}

In Anderson's farewell Test, Gus Atkinson did the same - only even more dramatically.\n\nWhere Anderson took 5-73 against Zimbabwe in 16 overs, Atkinson took five wickets inside his first nine overs, culminating in an extraordinary sequence of three wickets in four balls, and finished with innings figures of 7-45. For all of the excitement about Atkinson's pace, his brilliant debut showcased his array of skills.\n\nWicket one: Kraigg Brathwaite b Atkinson 6\n\nAtkinson is not a particularly demonstrative type. When he replaced Anderson from the Pavilion End, with West Indies 34-0 after ten overs, Atkinson showed no sign of the nervous tension sometimes associated with debutants, beginning with an 89mph delivery on off stump. His second ball was not quite as good, a little wide. But as Kraigg Brathwaite moved to cut the ball, he was suckered by Lord's low bounce, and inside-edged the ball onto his stumps. A contented smile revealed that Atkinson had reduced the gap with Anderson's Test wicket tally to a mere 699.\n\nWicket two: Kirk McKenzie c Crawley b Atkinson 1\n\nResisting the modern trend to go around the wicket to left-handers, Atkinson continued from over the wicket against Kirk McKenzie. Under clouds at Lord's, he recognised that lateral movement was a much greater threat than bounce. Angling the ball across McKenzie, Atkinson used his wobble seam grip - holding the ball wide of the seam, enabling it to move in either direction of the pitch. The line compelled McKenzie to play at the ball; the seam movement claimed the edge to Zak Crawley at second slip. Atkinson had yet to concede a run in Test cricket, but already had two wickets.\n\nWicket three: Alick Athanaze c Root b Atkinson 23\n\nInto his second spell - again from the Pavilion End - Atkinson continued with his over the wicket line of attack against left-handers. Alick Athanaze, who had looked West Indies' most accomplished batsman, was forced into playing at another awkward delivery across him. There was pace and a little bounce, yes - but, more than anything, the wicket was further reward for Atkinson pitching the ball up and trusting in his skill to generate seam movement.\n\nWicket four: Jason Holder c Brook b Atkinson 0\n\nAthanaze's dismissal brought in Jason Holder, who seemed a little over-promoted at number six in his first Test for 11 months. Immediately he was squared up by Atkinson, playing around the ball as he edged to Harry Brook, who added to England's list of smart catches in the slips. Atkinson used a more upright seam for this delivery, allowing him to get more bounce off the pitch. Barely three hours into his Test debut, Atkinson was on a hat-trick.\n\nWicket five: Joshua Da Silva c Smith b Atkinson 0\n\nThe hat-trick did not come; Joshua Da Silva defended his first ball to mid off. But Atkinson only had to wait one more ball for his next wicket. Using the wobble seam delivery again, this time Atkinson beat the inside edge. His Surrey teammate and fellow debutant Jamie Smith took his maiden Test catch to bring Atkinson a five-wicket haul on debut.\n\nWicket six: Alzarri Joseph c Woakes b Atkinson 17\n\nAfter West Indies collapsed to 88-7, Alzarri Joseph reasoned that there was no sense in poking and prodding like the top order and hit Atkinson for a flurry of four boundaries in five balls. Recognising Joseph's intent, now Atkinson made use of his white-ball repertoire. He begun his 11th over with a slower ball; Joseph continued to attack in the same vein, and miscued to mid on.\n\nWicket seven: Shamar Joseph c Pope b Atkinson 0\n\nUnder Ben Stokes's captaincy, England have embraced bowling short to the tail. Stokes has persisted with the tactic with bowlers operating at a little over 80mph - Anderson, Stuart Broad and Ollie Robinson. Now, with Atkinson, England can deploy the same tactic, but at altogether greater speeds; Atkinson showed as much when he clanged Joseph on the head first ball. From his second ball, Shamar Joseph, who bowled West Indies to their stunning victory at the Gabba in January, received a nasty bouncer too. Joseph slipped as he tried to play the shot, and then got a top edge to backward point.\n\nIt was a bizarre dismissal, but distilled the greatest reason for Atkinson's selection: the power of pace. And so what had begun as Anderson's day swiftly became Atkinson's instead. A few minutes before three o'clock, Atkinson paused on the boundary rope, held up the ball and then led England off through the long room, basking in the acclaim of his debut figures of 7-45.",

Being in the Long Room (of the Pavilion) was pretty special and the applause for Jimmy (Anderson) was pretty special. There was a bit of nerves, but ball in hand all good.\"\n\nWest Indies debutant Mikyle Louis, the first Test cricketer from St Kitts, top-scored with 27 in an innings where only three batsmen made it into the 20s.\n\nHaving played just one warm-up match and with inexperienced top-order batsmen Kirk McKenzie, Alick Athanaze and Kavem Hodge holding only nine caps between them before this Test, the West Indies unsurprisingly struggled after losing the toss in overcast conditions.\n\nThey were 88-3 when Atkinson, who had already taken two wickets before lunch, came on to bowl the 35th over.\n\nWith his second ball of the over he had Athanaze caught by Joe Root in the slips for 23.\n\nAtkinson, maintaining a challenging line and length, then produced a superb delivery next ball that former West Indies captain Holder, back after nearly a year out of Test cricket, edged to Harry Brook in the cordon.\n\nJoshua Da Silva survived the hat-trick but the following ball he too fell for a duck, an inside edge caught by opposing wicketkeeper Jamie Smith, who along with Surrey team-mate Atkinson was also making his Test debut.\n\nAtkinson had now taken three wickets for no runs in four balls, thereby securing his place on the Lord's honours board for a five-wicket haul in a Test.\n\nEarlier, Anderson was straight into the action when England captain Ben Stokes opted to field after winning the toss -- a decision greeted by huge cheers from the crowd at the 'Home of Cricket'.\n\nBut despite a probing new-ball spell of five overs for 11 runs, the 41-year-old Anderson was unable to dislodge either West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite or fellow opener Louis.\n\nWest Indies were looking to Brathwaite, appearing in his 90th Test, to make a significant score.\n\nBut he was out for two, chopping onto his stumps, as Atkinson struck with only his second ball Wednesday.\n\n\"It was a dream start,\" said Atkinson. \"Not the ball I was trying to bowl, but I can't complain! I felt comfortable straight away in the environment.\"\n\nLouis's promising 58-ball innings ended when the 23-year-old fell to a brilliant low catch by the diving Harry Brook at third slip off Stokes.\n\nWest Indies' plight was summed up when Hodge fell for 24 after a fierce square cut off Chris Woakes was well caught by Pope at point, the batsman sinking to his knees in disbelief.\n\nCrawley looked on course for a hundred before Seales bowled him with a rapid leg-stump yorker as an 89-ball innings, including 14 fours, came to a spectacular end.", "source": {"uri":

from debutant Gus Atkinson helped them bowl out the tourists for 121 on day one of the first Test at Lord's on Wednesday.\n\nJoe Root was not out on 15 with Harry Brook on 25, after boundary-studded innings of 76 from Zak Crawley and 57 from Ollie Pope put the home side ahead on an overcast day.\n\nEarlier, England fast bowler Atkinson took seven wickets for 45 runs while James Anderson, playing in his 188th and final Test before retirement, claimed his 701st wicket as the hosts dismissed the West Indies in just under 42 overs.\n\nAtkinson took three wickets in four balls at one point, just missing out on a hat-trick, and recorded the best figures by an Englishman on debut since Dominic Cork's seven for 43, also against the West Indies, in 1995.\n\nAnderson meanwhile is third on the

of St Kitts to play Test cricket for the West Indies, was his side's top scorer with 27 in an otherwise forgettable innings for the tourists.\n\nAtkinson claimed the wicket of the visitors' captain Kraigg Brathwaite (6) with his second ball and dismissed left-hander Kirk McKenzie for one soon after.\n\nLouis then became Ben Stokes' 199th Test wicket, putting the England skipper one short of an all-rounder's double of 200 wickets and 6,000 Test runs, a feat only before achieved by West Indian Garry Sobers and South Africa's Jacques Kallis.\n\nWith successive balls Atkinson removed Alick Athanaze for 23 and Jason Holder, back in the touring side's squad after nearly a year away, for a golden duck.\n\nTwo balls later, Atkinson had Joshua da Silva caught behind by wicketkeeper Jamie Smith for a duck, leaving the West Indies in deep trouble on 88 for six.\n\nChris Woakes took his 150th Test wicket when he removed Kavem Hodge for 24, and Atkinson dismissed Alzarri Joseph (17) and Shamar Joseph for another duck before Anderson brought the West Indies innings to a close with the wicket of Jayden Seales on two.\n\nIn reply, England lost Ben Duckett (3) early to the bowling of Seales before Pope and Crawley began hitting 11 and 14 fours respectively that took England past the Windies total.\n\nPope was eventually trapped leg before wicket by Holder, and four overs later

including three wickets in just one over.\n\nAnderson, by contrast, did not add to his tally of Test wickets until he had last man Jayden Seales lbw to end the West Indies innings.\n\nWest Indies debutant Mikyle Louis top-scored with 27 as the tourists were dismissed inside 42 overs.\n\nEngland were 30-1 in reply at tea after Ben Duckett was caught behind off Seales for three.\n\nHaving played just one warm-up match and with inexperienced top-order batsmen Kirk McKenzie, Alick Athanaze and Kavem Hodge holding only nine caps between them before this Test, it was little surprise the West Indies struggled after losing the toss in overcast conditions.\n\nWest Indies were 88-3 when Atkinson, who had already taken two wickets before lunch, came on to bowl the 35th over.\n\nWith his second ball of the over he had Athanaze caught by Joe Root in the slips for 23.\n\nAtkinson produced a superb delivery with the next ball that Jason Holder, returning to Test cricket after nearly a year's absence, could only edge to Harry Brook in the cordon.\n\nJoshua Da Silva survived the hat-trick but next ball he too fell for a duck, an inside edge caught by wicketkeeper Jamie Smith, who along with Surrey team-mate Atkinson was also making his Test debut.\n\nAtkinson had taken three wickets for no runs in four balls, with his final figures, after he accounted for Alzarri Joseph and Shamar Joseph, ranking as the second best by an England bowler on his Test debut behind Dominic Cork's 7-43 against the West Indies at Lord's in 1995.\n\nEarlier, Anderson was thrust straight into the action when England captain Ben Stokes won the toss and elected to field.\n\nBut despite a probing new-ball spell of five overs for 11 runs, the 41-year-old Anderson was unable to dislodge West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite or fellow opener Louis.\n\nAt the other end, Chris Woakes was lofted for a dismissive legside six by the 23-year-old Louis, the first West Indies Test cricketer from St Kitts.\n\nWest Indies were looking to Brathwaite, appearing in his 90th Test, to make a significant score.\n\nBut he fell for just two when he chopped onto his stumps as Atkinson struck with only his second ball in Test cricket.\n\nLouis' promising 58-ball innings ended shortly before lunch when he fell to a brilliant low catch by the diving Brook at third slip off Stokes.\n\nWest Indies' plight was summed up when Hodge fell for 24 after a fierce square cut off Woakes was well caught by Ollie Pope at point, the batsman sinking to his knees in disbelief.", "source": {"uri":

England great James Anderson's farewell by taking a sensational seven wickets on his Test debut as the West Indies collapsed to 121 all out on Wednesday's opening day at Lord's.\n\nEngland then consolidated their advantage to be 189-3 at stumps, a lead of 58 runs, with Zak Crawley (76) and Ollie Pope (57) both making fluent fifties.\n\nThe build-up to the first of this three-match series had centred on the retiring Anderson's last international appearance following a record-breaking Test career that has now yielded 701 wickets - the most by any fast bowler at this level.\n\nBut it was 26-year-old quick Atkinson who took centre stage instead with a remarkable haul of 7-45 in 12 overs - including a triple wicket-maiden.\n\nAtkinson's final figures, after he accounted for Alzarri Joseph and Shamar Joseph, were the second best by an England bowler on a Test debut behind Dominic Cork's 7-43 against the West Indies at Lord's in 1995.\n\nAnderson, by contrast, did not add to his

which, on this early evidence, Atkinson could form a key part of.\n\nThe notoriously shy Anderson, 41, was given a tremendous reception from the Lord's crowd ahead of play on Wednesday, at the venue where he took a five-wicket haul on debut versus Zimbabwe in 2003.\n\nHowever, he was outshone by Surrey seamer Atkinson (7-45) as the new boy became the eighth England bowler to bag seven wickets on Test debut and the second this year after spinner Tom Hartley achieved the feat against India in Hyderabad in January.\n\nEngland closed on 189-3 to lead by 68 with Ollie Pope (57) and Zak Crawley (76) sharing a busy second-wicket stand of 94, one that was briefly paused by bad light in the evening session before the day ended in the glorious sunshine that is also forecast for day two.\n\nEarlier, Atkinson struck with his second ball as West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite chopped on, while he then claimed three wickets in four balls in the 35th over, including Jason Holder for a golden duck, amid the tourists losing four wickets for no runs from 88-3.\n\nAnderson picked up the final wicket of the innings - his first of the day and the 701st of his glittering Test career - when he pinned Jayden Seales lbw, sparking another huge Lord's roar.\n\nBut the day belonged to Atkinson, who, admittedly while dismantling a highly-inexperienced West Indies batting line-up, showed there will be life after Anderson as Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum's men build for that Ashes assignment in 16 months' time.\n\nAtkinson's pace and hostility could be crucial in Australia and he was too hot for West Indies to handle in overcast conditions on a slow pitch in England, rewarded for attacking, accurate lines and his wobble-seam variations after being introduced in the 11th over.\n\nAfter bowling a driving Brathwaite off an inside edge, Atkinson had Kyle McKenzie (1) caught at slip attempting a similar shot in his third over and did not concede a run until his fourth as he entered the lunch break with figures of 2-4 from five overs, four of them maidens.\n\nWest Indies - for whom Mikyle Louis top-scored with 27 before he was out to a stunning one-handed slip catch from Harry Brook off Stokes - dug in before and after lunch, with Kavem Hodge (24) and Alick Athanaze (23) sharing a stand of 44 from 44-3.\n\nAtkinson broke that partnership when he nicked off Athanaze and carnage then ensued, with Holder clipping to slip next delivery.\n\nJoshua Da Silva fell for a blob two balls after that, inside edging behind to Atkinson's Surrey team-mate and fellow England debutant Jamie Smith - Smith having been selected as wicketkeeper ahead of regular Surrey gloveman Ben Foakes and Test veteran Jonny Bairstow, principally due to his batting prowess.\n\nWest Indies lost a fourth wicket in eight balls when Pope's screamer of a catch at backward point removed Hodge and handed Chris Woakes his 150th Test breakthrough in his first match in the format since being named Player of the Ashes last summer.\n\nAlzarri Joseph (17 off 9) counterpunched temporarily for West Indies, whipping and lofting Atkinson for four sublime boundaries in the 37th over, before he and namesake Shamar Joseph (0) were caught swiping Atkinson in the 39th to leave the tourists 106-9.\n\nAt that point, Atkinson was eyeing becoming the first England bowler to take eight wickets on Test debut, only for Anderson to end that hope when he trapped Seales leg before to end the innings in 41.4 overs.\n\nAnderson had been given the first over of the day but both he and Woakes were arguably a little short in the first half hour as Louis - the first man from St Kitts to play Test cricket for West Indies - and Brathwaite batted diligently, with Louis also hitting Woakes for six.\n\nAdmittedly, there was not much swing on offer for Anderson and Woakes but that changed once Atkinson and Stokes - the latter now confident he can fulfil full all-rounder duties once again after successful knee surgery - came on to bowl.\n\nWest Indies' high-quality pace attack - Holder, Seales and the Josephs - found some movement, too, with Seales forcing Ben Duckett to snick behind, but Crawley and the occasionally frenetic Pope batted proactively as England eased past the tourists' teeny total.\n\nPope successfully reviewed an lbw dismissal off Holder on 33, thanks to Crawley's encouragement, with the delivery set to bypass his leg stump but he was eventually pinned in front by the same bowler.\n\nCrawley was then bowled leg stump by a crackerjack delivery from Seales - the England opener has now failed to convert his last six Test half-centuries into three figures - with Harry Brook (25no) and Joe Root (15no) unbeaten at stumps.\n\nWatch day two of the first Test between England and West Indies at Lord's live on Sky Sports Cricket from 10.15am on Thursday.\n\nStream Sky Sports live with no contract on a Month or Day membership on NOW.

UrduPoint", "body": "England debutant Gus Atkinson upstaged James Anderson's farewell by taking a sensational seven wickets as the West Indies collapsed to 121 all out on Wednesday's opening day of the first Test at Lord's\n\nLondon, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 10th Jul, 2024) England debutant Gus Atkinson upstaged James Anderson's farewell by taking a sensational seven wickets as the West Indies collapsed to 121 all out on Wednesday's opening day of the first Test at Lord's.\n\nThe build-up to the three-match series had centred on England great Anderson's last appearance in the five-day game following a record-breaking Test career that has yielded 701 wickets -- the most by any fast bowler at that level.\n\nBut Surrey quick Atkinson stole the spotlight with a remarkable haul of 7-45 in 12 overs -- including three wickets in just one over.\n\nAnderson, by contrast, did not add to his tally of Test wickets until he had last man Jayden Seales lbw to end the West Indies innings.\n\nWest Indies debutant Mikyle Louis top-scored with 27 as the tourists were dismissed inside 42 overs.\n\nEngland were 30-1 in reply at tea after Ben Duckett was caught behind off Seales for three.\n\nHaving played just one warm-up match and with inexperienced top-order batsmen Kirk McKenzie, Alick Athanaze and Kavem Hodge holding only nine caps between them before this Test, it was little surprise the West Indies struggled after losing the toss in overcast conditions.\n\nWest Indies were 88-3 when Atkinson, who had already taken two wickets before lunch, came on to bowl the 35th over.\n\nWith his second ball of the over he had Athanaze caught by Joe Root in the slips for 23.\n\nAtkinson produced a superb delivery with the next ball that Jason Holder, returning to Test cricket after nearly a year's absence, could only edge to Harry Brook in the cordon.\n\nJoshua Da Silva survived the hat-trick but next ball he too fell for a duck, an inside edge caught by wicketkeeper Jamie Smith, who along with Surrey team-mate Atkinson was also making his Test debut.\n\nAtkinson had taken three wickets for no runs in four balls, with his final figures, after he accounted for Alzarri Joseph and Shamar Joseph, ranking as the second best by an England bowler on his Test debut behind Dominic Cork's 7-43 against the West Indies at Lord's in 1995.\n\nEarlier, Anderson was thrust straight into the action when England captain Ben Stokes won the toss and elected to field.\n\nBut despite a probing new-ball spell of five overs for 11 runs, the 41-year-old Anderson was unable to dislodge West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite or fellow opener Louis.\n\nAt the other end, Chris Woakes was lofted for a dismissive legside six by the 23-year-old Louis, the first West Indies Test cricketer from St Kitts.\n\nWest Indies were looking to Brathwaite, appearing in his 90th Test, to make a significant score.\n\nBut he fell for just two when he chopped onto his stumps as Atkinson struck with only his second ball in Test cricket.\n\nLouis' promising 58-ball innings ended shortly before lunch when he fell to a brilliant low catch by the diving Brook at third slip off Stokes.\n\nWest Indies' plight was summed up when Hodge fell for 24 after a fierce square cut off Woakes was well caught by Ollie Pope at point, the batsman sinking to his knees in disbelief.",

Indeed, he was a toddler when Anderson made his own Test debut here at Lord's back in 2003.\n\nBut he completely upstaged the elder statesman on a thrilling first day of the Test summer, Atkinson taking seven for 45 to help blow away a brittle West Indies batting line-up for 121.\n\nBy stumps, with England 68 ahead on 189 for three after half-centuries from Zak Crawley and Ollie Pope, this Test looks as good as over as a contest already.\n\nIt will certainly be a long way back for a West Indies team who were not only undercooked coming into this series following one low-grade warm-up match against a County Select XI but seriously inexperienced given their entire team only has 60 more Test caps than Anderson's 188.\n\nNo surprise then Bazball 2.0 has got off to the best start possible after a five-month hiatus following a 4-1 mauling in India.\n\nWith sights now firmly set on the next Ashes series in Australia in 16 months' time, a performance like this from Atkinson goes a long way to vindicating the decision by England's brains trust to force the retirement of a 41-year-old Anderson.\n\nThe tipping point for a debut that quickly transitioned from good to great came in the eighth over of the afternoon when Atkinson, who had taken two for two in a fine opening spell in the morning, took three wickets in four balls to remove Alick Athanaze, Jason Holder and Joshua Da Silva.\n\nWith five for 20 at that stage, he was on course for the best debut figures by an England bowler. Once he'd added the wickets of Alzarri Joseph and Shamar Joseph to his haul, Atkinson looked odds on to better the landmark seven for 43 taken by Dominic Cork on this ground against the West Indies in 1995.\n\nBy the end of the innings, brought to a close when Anderson finally got on the board with the wicket of No 11 Jayden Seales, Atkinson had conceded eight from his final over and the chance of claiming Cork's record had gone.\n\nHowever, it would be foolish to diminish the significance of this performance.\n\nGus Atkinson's first over was the second-fastest by an England bowler on Test debut in\n\nthe ball-tracking era (since 2007).\n\n(Source: Cricviz)\n\nAtkinson had made his England debut at the end of last summer in a T20 against New Zealand at Old Trafford. He has made 11 more appearances across both white-ball formats since, including against South Africa, the Netherlands and Pakistan during the doomed 50-over World Cup defence in India last winter.\n\nHe had looked promising but did not catch fire, no surprise given the way England's white-ball environment has deteriorated in recent months. But having been an unused squad member on that Test tour of India earlier this year, Atkinson was given his chance here and he has grabbed it with both hands.\n\nHis afternoon rampage brought the best out of Bazball too, Stokes setting an uber-aggressive field for Atkinson's hat-trick ball to Da Silva that comprised five slips, a leg slip, gully and short leg.\n\nNo matter Da Silva survived, he was gone next ball when Atkinson's fellow debutant, wicketkeeper Jamie Smith, took a difficult chance off an inside edge.\n\nFor an English cricketing public seeking new heroes, Atkinson's backstory is also one we can all buy into.\n\nA player who suffered three stress fractures of the back early in his career, he has had to battle his way to this point. In the same age group at Surrey as Ollie Pope, Sam Curran and Will Jacks, Atkinson has taken longer than his peers to break through.\n\nBut the biggest thing he has had to deal with is the tragic death of his mother, Caroline, in a car crash in 2020. With his father, Ed, living in the United Arab Emirates, Atkinson relied heavily on his friends and team-mates at Surrey and did a lot of growing up in a very short space of time.\n\nSpeaking earlier this year, Atkinson, whose dad Ed was at Lord's, admitted: \"My mum pushed me forward almost behind my back. She'd get in touch with Surrey to make sure I was still in the loop when perhaps I might have been falling behind the others.\n\n\"Once my mum passed away my career could have gone one or two ways and I wanted to take it in the direction she would have wanted. So to be in this position is very special.\"\n\nThere's no better way to describe this performance.\n\nBazball-o-meter: 8\n\nThis all felt pretty pedestrian until an Atkinson-inspired Caribbean collapse after lunch moved this Test forward at warp speed. By stumps, with England's batters leading the charge, the Bazballers were way ahead.\n\nJames Anderson toiled for five overs before Gus Atkinson was thrown the ball for the first time in Test cricket. It took the Surrey quick two deliveries to pick up his first wicket, West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite bowled via an inside edge. Atkinson, 26, still hadn't conceded a run by the time he took his second four overs later, Kirk McKenzie edging to second slip.\n\nThe flying Yorkshireman\n\nBen Stokes back as a full-time bowler completely changes the balance of this team. Fully fit again after knee surgery last November, he was a handful here and got a wicket thanks to a stunning one-handed grab from Harry Brook at third slip that ended a decent debut knock from Mikyle Louis. Brook worked hard on his fitness over the winter. It was for moments like this.\n\nFive-star performance\n\nThe eighth over after lunch - a triple-wicket maiden from Atkinson - was ridiculous. Alick Athanaze and Jason Holder fell in successive deliveries before Joshua Da Silva saw off the hat-trick ball. But he then fell to the next - sending an inside edge through to keeper Jamie Smith as both debutants combined. Atkinson had five for 20 at this stage.\n\nOh Jimmy, Jimmy...\n\nThe man of the moment had to watch on as Atkinson stole his thunder. But when Anderson finally got a wicket, trapping Jayden Seales lbw to wrap up the West Indies first innings it produced the biggest cheer of the day at Lord's.\n\nZak in his armour\n\nZak Crawley looked on course for a fifth Test century after reaching 76 late in the day.\n\nBut the opener, who'd been working his way through the gears during the evening session, was unable to keep out a brilliant yorker from Jayden Seales as England lost their third wicket with 153 on the board.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Kirk McKenzie, Alick Athanaze, Jason Holder, Joshua Da Silva, Alzarri Joseph, and Shamar Joseph all subsequently fell victim to the 26-year-old right-handed fast bowler Atkinson, who had a day to remember.\n\nWhile Cork's debut had helped England to a 72-run win in 1995, against the same opposition at the same venue, Atkinson's figures have given Ben Stokes' side a huge advantage going into the second innings - West Indies were bowled out for 121 in the first innings, with England responding strongly later on day one, with Zak Crawley and Ollie Pope hitting fifties.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nWest Indies 121 all out in 41.4 overs (Mikyle Louis 27;

England later reached 30 for one by tea, losing Ben Duckett.\n\nAnderson belatedly got in on the act, dismissing number 11 Jayden Seales to end the innings and give a sellout crowd the moment they came for, but Atkinson well and truly stole the show.\n\nHe enjoyed a dream start to life at the top table, removing captain Kraigg Brathwaite with his second delivery as a Test cricketer, taking his next wicket before he had even conceded a run and then taking three wickets in an over in the afternoon session.\n\nHe was on course for the best ever figures by and English bowler on Test debut, denied only by a late boundary that left Dominic Cork's haul of seven for 43 in 1995 intact.\n\nWhile Anderson was upstaged at his own leaving party, he may have enjoyed a moment of nostalgia recalling his own debut five-for at the same ground back in 2003.\n\nAtkinson becomes the fifth bowler to take a five-wicket haul on his first appearance under the captaincy of Ben Stokes, following Will Jacks, Rehan Ahmed, Josh Tongue and Tom Hartley.\n\nAnderson was everywhere at the start of play - staring out from the front of the matchday programme, featuring in a series of loving television montages and even splashed in silhouette across a commemorative hoodie for sale at \u00a360 in the club shop.\n\nHis daughters Ruby and Lola even had the honour of ringing the five-minute bell on the balcony of the pavilion. Stokes gave the fans what they wanted when he won the toss and opted to bowl first, but all that was missing was an early breakthrough for the man of the moment.\n\nHe bowled tidily and beat the bat a couple of times in a five-over burst with the new ball but it was not until Atkinson took over that things began to happen. His second ball was little more than a loosener but Brathwaite waved a crooked bat outside off stump and dragged down his own stumps.\n\nAtkinson swiftly cleared 90mph on the speed gun and then picked up a more classical wicket, suckering Kirk McKenzie into a drive and seeing a thick edge sail through to slip. By the time he collected his cap he had two wickets in three overs and had yet to give up a single run.\n\nThe West Indies struggled to 61 for three at lunch, Stokes accounting for debutant opener Mikyle Louis thanks to a brilliant one-handed slip catch from Harry Brook.\n\nAtkinson returned to cause havoc after the interval, finding himself on a hat-trick in his ninth over as he probed away at good pace to have Alick Athanaze and Jason Holder caught in the cordon.\n\nJosh Da Silva kept out a decent hat-trick ball but was gone to the next delivery pushing forward and feathering through to give England's new wicketkeeper Jamie Smith his first catch and Atkinson his dream five-for.\n\nA brilliant reaction catch from Ollie Pope did for Kavem Hodge - taking the score from 88 for three to 88 for seven in the space of eight balls. Atkinson greedily snapped up two more, Alzarri Joseph and Shamar Joseph both trying and failing to slog their way out of trouble, before Anderson finished things off by trapping Seales lbw.\n\nThe crowd sang his name as one but it was Atkinson who led the team from the field. Duckett made a scratchy three before nicking Seales behind, with Zak Crawley more expansive for 24 not out.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening

Atkinson became the seventh Englishman to pick up seven wickets in an innings on debut - his 7/45 only bettered by Dominic Cork's 7/43 against West Indies at the same venue back in 1995. The visitors ended up losing seven wickets for the addition of only 60 runs to fold cheaply and England went into the Tea break at 30/1, with Zak Crawley batting on 24.\n\nEngland's openers started cautiously in the first three overs, with only three runs coming off them, before Zak Crawley struck two consecutive boundaries off Jayden Seales. Ben Duckett had a lucky break as Mikyle Louis put down a simple catch at point to deny Alzarri Joseph a wicket in the fifth over. Crawley got a boundary in the same over, just about clearing mid on. Seales ended the opening stand on the brink of Tea by getting Duckett to edge to the 'keeper.\n\nThe second session started with Atkinson bowling a short ball to Kavem Hodge who put it away for a four, signalling intent straightaway after a watchful first session in which West Indies scored at just over two an over. Alick Athanaze brought out the straight drives against Chris Woakes for two successive boundaries in the next over. Although he wasn't completely in control, Hodge also dispatched a short ball from Atkinson for a six. While Woakes tested Athanaze a bit coming around the wicket, the left-handed batter did not have any problems against Atkinson when he drove one through covers for another four.\n\nAtkinson, however, hit back to have Athanaze edge to first slip, ending a 44-run fourth wicket stand, and then dismissed Jason Holder for a first-ball duck. Joshua Da Silva ensured Atkinson did not bag a hat-trick but fell soon after, getting an inside-edge to hand debutant wicketkeeper Jamie Smith his first catch. Atkinson, in the process, became the ninth England bowler to bag a fifer on Test debut at Lord's. The milestones continued for the England bowlers as Pope took a sharp catch when Hodge cut one hard off Woakes, giving the bowler his 150th Test wicket.\n\nAlzarri Joseph decided to take the attack to England, striking four fours in an over off Atkinson, much to the delight of Sir Viv Richards who was cheering on from the stands. The fast bowler helped West Indies past 100 but fell looking for a big one off Atkinson, giving the pacer his sixth wicket. Atkinson picked up his seventh by having Shamar Joseph top-edge a pull but he couldn't become the first England bowler to pick up 8 in an innings on debut as James Anderson wrapped up West Indies' innings by trapping Seales in front.\n\nEarlier, in the first session, the debutants shone for both teams with England's regular strikes helping them gain ascendancy. The 23-year old opener Mikyle Louis began confidently, striking regular boundaries along with a pick-up shot for a six off Woakes, while the experienced Kraigg Brathwaite struggled against the moving ball. Despite his probing lines, Anderson couldn't pick up a wicket in his first spell, in which he bowled five overs for 11 runs, including two maidens. Meanwhile, Atkinson made a good first impression as he accounted for the wickets of Brathwaite (inside edge onto the stumps) and Kirk McKenzie (caught at second slip) to make early inroads.\n\nThe focus was also on Ben Stokes and his fitness, with the England captain having decided to skip the IPL and the T20 World Cup to get back to optimum shape. He brought himself at the start of the 14th over and bowled till the close of the first session, bowling eight overs in his first spell. He was moving the ball both ways and mixing his lengths to keep the batters guessing. His persistence eventually reaped reward as Louis got a thick outside edge to third slip where Harry Brook pulled off a stunning one-handed catch. Anderson, brought back into the attack, and Stokes bowled till the end of the first session but Hodge and Athanaze saw through to Lunch without any damage, only for Atkinson to run through the West Indies order after the break.\n\nBrief scores: West Indies 121 (Mikyle Louis 27, Kavem Hodge 24; Gus Atkinson 7-45 Ben Stokes 1-14) lead England 30/1 (Zak Crawley 24*, Jayden Seales 1-11) by 91

England reached 3-189 at the close, Zak Crawley and Ollie Pope making half-centuries as they established a first-day lead of 68.\n\nWhen the West Indies were nine down, with Atkinson bowling, the seamer was one wicket from securing the best figures by any Test debutant. But a couple of boundaries meant Albert Trott's 8-43 for Australia against England in Adelaide in 1895 remains supreme. Indeed, so does Dominic Cork's England-best 7-43 against the West Indies at Lord's a century later.\n\nInstead it was Anderson who claimed the last wicket, that of Jayden Seales, to the biggest cheer of the day. That took Anderson, who will be 42 later this month, to 701 wickets in his 22-year Test career, a tally eclipsed only by Warne and Muttiah Muralitharan.\n\nBefore play the five-minute bell on the balcony of the pavilion was rung by Anderson's daughters Ruby and Lola with his parents and wife alongside.\n\nWest Indies, however, refused to play along and had reached 0-34 without alarm when Anderson left the attack. But they were soon 3-43 with Atkinson taking two and top scorer Mikyle Louis (27) dismissed by skipper Ben Stokes.\n\nAlick Athanaze (23) and Kavem Hodge (24) added 40 but when Atkinson parted them the tourists collapsed, losing 7-33 with Atkinson taking three wickets in four balls at one point. England were aided by superb catching, notably by Harry Brook and Pope.\n\nThe tourists, who had only one warm-up match, fielded less well, Crawley escaping a run out before he had scored and Ben Duckett dropped on one. The latter perished soon after but Crawley took advantage, making 76.

England later reached 30 for one by tea, losing Ben Duckett.\n\nAnderson belatedly got in on the act, dismissing number 11 Jayden Seales to end the innings and give a sellout crowd the moment they came for, but Atkinson well and truly stole the show.\n\nHe enjoyed a dream start to life at the top table, removing captain Kraigg Brathwaite with his second delivery as a Test cricketer, taking his next wicket before he had even conceded a run and then taking three wickets in an over in the afternoon session.\n\nHe was on course for the best ever figures by and English bowler on Test debut, denied only by a late boundary that left Dominic Cork's haul of seven for 43 in 1995 intact.\n\nWhile Anderson was upstaged at his own leaving party, he may have enjoyed a moment of nostalgia recalling his own debut five-for at the same ground back in 2003.\n\nAtkinson becomes the fifth bowler to take a five-wicket haul on his first appearance under the captaincy of Ben Stokes, following Will Jacks, Rehan Ahmed, Josh Tongue and Tom Hartley.\n\nAnderson was everywhere at the start of play - staring out from the front of the matchday programme, featuring in a series of loving television montages and even splashed in silhouette across a commemorative hoodie for sale at \u00a360 in the club shop.\n\nHis daughters Ruby and Lola even had the honour of ringing the five-minute bell on the balcony of the pavilion. Stokes gave the fans what they wanted when he won the toss and opted to bowl first, but all that was missing was an early breakthrough for the man of the moment.\n\nHe bowled tidily and beat the bat a couple of times in a five-over burst with the new ball but it was not until Atkinson took over that things began to happen. His second ball was little more than a loosener but Brathwaite waved a crooked bat outside off stump and dragged down his own stumps.\n\nAtkinson swiftly cleared 90mph on the speed gun and then picked up a more classical wicket, suckering Kirk McKenzie into a drive and seeing a thick edge sail through to slip. By the time he collected his cap he had two wickets in three overs and had yet to give up a single run.\n\nThe West Indies struggled to 61 for three at lunch, Stokes accounting for debutant opener Mikyle Louis thanks to a brilliant one-handed slip catch from Harry Brook.\n\nThe skipper's reaction - open-mouthed and eyes bulging in shock - was reminiscent of Stuart Broad's meme-worthy response to an even more memorable Stokes catch in the 2015 Ashes.\n\nAtkinson returned to cause havoc after the interval, finding himself on a hat-trick in his ninth over as he probed away at good pace to have Alick Athanaze and Jason Holder caught in the cordon.\n\nJosh Da Silva kept out a decent hat-trick ball but was gone to the next delivery pushing forward and feathering through to give England's new wicketkeeper Jamie Smith his first catch and Atkinson his dream five-for.\n\nA brilliant reaction catch from Ollie Pope did for Kavem Hodge - taking the score from 88 for three to 88 for seven in the space of eight balls. Atkinson greedily snapped up two more, Alzarri Joseph and Shamar Joseph both trying and failing to slog their way out of trouble, before Anderson finished things off by trapping Seales lbw.\n\nThe crowd sang his name as one but it was Atkinson who led the team from the field. Duckett made a scratchy three before nicking Seales behind, with Zak Crawley more expansive for 24 not out.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors":

James Anderson claimed his 701 Test scalp as the West Indies were bowled out for 121, and although it is too early to say the side has found the seamer's replacement, the Surrey fast bowler has laid down a marker.\n\nOnly one Englishman has finished with better figures on debut. It was Dominic Cork, also against the West Indies at Lord's back in 1995, and Atkinson's seven for 45 puts him 11 on the list for best figures on Test debut.\n\nHaving never played a first-class match at Lord's beforehand, Atkinson looked almost instantly at home, claiming the wicket of Kraigg Brathwaite, who played onto his own stumps with only his second ball in the format. The breakthrough came after 10 wicketless overs from the experienced Anderson and Chris Woakes at the start of the day after England won the toss and elected to bowl.\n\nIt is too early to predict Atkinson's future, but Anderson claimed five wickets on Test debut at Lord's, against Zimbabwe 21 years previously. Although there are few similarities between the two in terms of style, Anderson is a swing bowler, while Atkinson is more front-on and often favours the cross-seam delivery, bowling wicket to wicket, few make such an impression on their debut.\n\nAnderson took the final wicket of the innings as the West Indies were bowled out for a disappointing 121 inside the first two sessions of play.\n\nThe entire day was set to pay tribute to Anderson after 22 years of international cricket for England. His family rang the bell five minutes before play, and Lord's had a number of montages prepared for the big screen to showcase his achievements over more than two decades.\n\nAnderson did get in on the act, and the crowd responded, but it was a reminder that the occasion is not about one person, and instead, as England look to the future, they could have a new player to celebrate. Atkinson was awarded his cap in front of his family in a huddle by Surrey teammate Ollie Pope.\n\n\"I'm very proud, I don't think it's really sunk in yet to be honest. I was looking up at the board and seeing my figures and just thinking 'wow',\" Atkinson said.\n\n\"I was still pretty nervous going into it but the focus was on Jimmy (Anderson) so it was pretty nice to go under the radar a bit.\n\n\"I tried to keep as level as possible my dad was saying 'this is the biggest day of your life' and I was trying to stay relaxed.\"\n\nBen Stokes and Brendon McCullum have not been unafraid to throw the ball to inexperienced players, and have often reaped the reward. Will Jacks took a five-for on debut during the first overseas tour of the Bazball era against Pakistan in Rawalpindi, and Rehan Ahmed did the same on his maiden appearance in the third Test of that series in Karachi.\n\nJosh Tonge took five wickets in a standalone Test match before the Ashes in the summer of 2023, and Tom Hartley took seven on his debut at Hyderabad. Atkinson is the latest to repay the England leadership for his faith in the next generation.\n\nWhen it came their turn to bat, England started in an uncharacteristically subdued fashion, but a 94-run partnership between Ollie Pope and Zak Crawley was put on in more typical Bazball fashion.\n\nPope made a useful 57 from 74 before he was trapped lbw by Jason Holder, who had had two lbw decisions overturned by DRS on review previously.\n\nCrawley made 76 before being bowled by Jayden Seales, and at the close of play, England were 68 runs ahead and three wickets down on 189 for three.",

West Indies, who started the second session at 61/3, ended up being bowled out for a lowly 121 as Atkinson became the seventh Englishman to pick up seven in an innings on debut - his 7/45 only bettered by Dominic Cork's 7/43 against West Indies at the same venue back in 1995. England then rode on Crawley's 76 and Pope's 57, scoring 159 in the final session at a run-rate of 5.9 to go into stumps on Wednesday (July 10) at 189/3, leading by 68 runs.\n\nThe debutants shone for both teams with England's regular strikes helping them gain ascendancy in the first session after the hosts opted to bowl. The 23-year-old opener Mikyle Louis, playing his first game for West Indies, began confidently striking regular boundaries along with a pick-up shot for a six off Chris Woakes, while the experienced Kraigg Brathwaite struggled against the moving ball. Despite his probing lines, the 41-year-old James Anderson playing his farewell Test, couldn't pick up a wicket in his first spell. Atkinson then came into the attack and made a good first impression as he accounted for the wickets of Brathwaite (inside edge onto the stumps) and Kirk McKenzie (caught at second slip).\n\nThe focus was also on Ben Stokes and his fitness, with the England captain having decided to skip the IPL and the T20 World Cup to get back to optimum shape. He brought himself at the start of the 14th over and bowled till the close of the first session, bowling eight overs in his first spell. He was moving the ball both ways and mixing his lengths to keep the batters guessing. His persistence eventually reaped reward as Louis got a thick outside edge to third slip where Harry Brook pulled off a stunning one-handed catch. Anderson, brought back into the attack, and Stokes bowled till the end of the first session but Hodge and Alick Athanaze saw through to Lunch without any damage.\n\nThe second session started with Atkinson bowling a short ball to Kavem Hodge who put it away for a four, signalling intent straightaway after a watchful first session in which West Indies scored at just over two an over. Athanaze brought out the straight drives against Woakes for two successive boundaries in the next over. Although he wasn't completely in control, Hodge also dispatched a short ball from Atkinson for a six. While Woakes tested Athanaze a bit coming around the wicket, the left-handed batter did not have any problems against Atkinson when he drove one through covers for another four. Atkinson, however, hit back to have Athanaze edge to first slip, ending a 44-run fourth wicket stand, and then dismissed Holder for a first-ball duck.\n\nJoshua Da Silva ensured Atkinson did not bag a hat-trick but fell soon after, getting an inside edge to hand debutant wicketkeeper Jamie Smith his first catch. Atkinson, in the process, became the ninth England bowler to bag a fifer on Test debut at Lord's. The milestones continued for the England bowlers as Pope took a sharp catch when Hodge cut one hard off Woakes, giving the bowler his 150th Test wicket. Joseph decided to take the attack to England, striking four fours in an over off Atkinson, but he fell on his sword looking for a big one. Atkinson then picked up his seventh by having Shamar Joseph top-edge a pull but he couldn't become the first England bowler to pick up eight in an innings on debut as Anderson wrapped up West Indies' innings by trapping Jayden Seales in front.\n\nEngland's openers started cautiously in the first three overs, with only three runs coming off them, before Crawley struck two consecutive boundaries off Seales. Ben Duckett had a lucky break as Louis put down a simple catch at point to deny Alzarri Joseph a wicket in the fifth over. Crawley got a boundary in the same over, just about clearing mid on. Seales ended the opening stand on the brink of Tea by getting Duckett to edge to the 'keeper. Pope started positively after the break and West Indies didn't have any luck going their way as Pope first reversed a leg-before decision given in Jason Holder's over before the same bowler watched on disappointed as West Indies' review for a leg-before decision against Crawley didn't yield any positive returns.\n\nMeanwhile, the light meters were brought out regularly with the greying clouds overhead before the umpires decided to take the players off the field briefly for bad light. West Indies' bowlers were a lot tighter with their lines when the players returned, which meant the scoring rate slowed down a touch. But it was only a while before the boundaries started coming again, with a four apiece off Joseph helping Pope and Crawley bring up their half-centuries. England's second wicket pair extended their partnership to 94 as they helped their side into the lead before Holder gave West Indies some respite by having Pope out lbw.\n\nBut the frequency of boundaries increased as Root played a late cut off Seales while Crawley targetted Joseph, scoring four boundaries in two overs, although a couple of them were thick outside edges. He also struck a four off Seales before getting bowled by a yorker in the same over as Crawley got out in the 70s for the seventh time in his career, failing to convert his last six 50-plus scores into a 100. Root and Brook then added an unbroken 36-run stand, with the latter scoring 25 of those runs, including three fours, as they led England into Stumps with a handy lead.\n\nBrief scores: West Indies 121 (Mikyle Louis 27, Kavem Hodge 24; Gus Atkinson 7-45 Ben Stokes 1-14) trail England 189/3 (Zak Crawley 76, Ollie Pope 57; Jayden Seales 2-31) by 68 runs.", "source": {"uri": "cricbuzz.com", "dataType":

steals retiring James Anderson\u00b4s limelight at...", "body": "Debutant Gus Atkinson gatecrashed James Anderson's leaving party at Lord's, claiming stunning figures of seven for 45 as England blew away West Indies on day one of the first Test.\n\nThe home of cricket was primed to pay tribute to Anderson, lining up for his country for the final time after a record-breaking 22-year career, but instead witnessed Atkinson kickstarting a new chapter in breathtaking fashion.\n\nIn a true torch-passing moment, the Surrey paceman assumed centre stage as he toppled the tourists for 121.\n\nAnderson belatedly got in on the act, dismissing number 11 Jayden Seales to end the innings and give a sellout crowd the moment they came for, but Atkinson well and truly stole the show.\n\nEngland had assumed complete control by the close, moving into a 68-run lead as half-centuries from Zak Crawley (76) and Ollie Pope (57) left them 189 for three.\n\nBut the heavy lifting was done by Atkinson, who returned career-best first-class figures as he became the fifth bowler to claim a five-for on debut under Ben Stokes' captaincy.\n\nHe opened his account with his second delivery as a Test cricketer, added another before he had even conceded a run and then took three wickets in four balls during the afternoon session.\n\nHe was on course for the best figures by an English bowler on Test debut, denied only by a late boundary that left Dominic Cork's haul of seven for 43 in 1995 intact.\n\nWhile Anderson was upstaged at his own farewell event, he may have enjoyed a moment of nostalgia recalling his own debut five-for at the same ground back in 2003.\n\nThe country's record wicket-taker was everywhere at the start of play - staring out from the front of the matchday programme, featuring in a series of loving television montages and splashed in silhouette across a commemorative hoodie on sale at \u00a360 in the club shop.\n\nHis daughters Ruby and Lola even had the honour of ringing the five-minute bell at the start of the day.\n\nStokes gave fans what they wanted when he won the toss and opted to bowl first under cloudy skies, but all that was missing was an early breakthrough for the man of the moment.\n\nJames Anderson, left, started his final Test for England (Steven Paston/PA)\n\nHe bowled tidily and beat the bat a couple of times in a five-over burst with the new ball but it was not until Atkinson took over that things began to happen.\n\nHis second ball was little more than a loosener but Windies captain Kraigg Brathwaite waved a crooked bat outside off stump and dragged down his own stumps.\n\nAtkinson soon touched 90mph on the speed gun and then picked up a more classical wicket, suckering Kirk McKenzie into a drive and seeing a thick edge sail through to slip.\n\nBy the end of his first spell he boasted pristine figures of 5-3-2-2.\n\nWest Indies struggled to 61 for three at lunch, Stokes accounting for debutant opener Mikyle Louis for 27 thanks to a brilliant one-handed slip catch from Harry Brook.\n\nThe skipper's reaction - open-mouthed and eyes bulging in shock - was reminiscent of Stuart Broad's meme-worthy response to an even more memorable Stokes catch in the 2015 Ashes.\n\nAtkinson returned to cause havoc after the interval, finding himself on a hat-trick in his ninth over as he pounded out an attacking channel and had Alick Athanaze and Jason Holder caught in the cordon.\n\nJosh Da Silva kept out a decent hat-trick delivery but succumbed to the next one, pushing forward and feathering through to give England's new wicketkeeper Jamie Smith his first catch and Atkinson a place on the honours board.\n\nA brilliant reaction catch from Pope did for Kavem Hodge - taking the score from 88 for three to 88 for seven in the space of eight balls.\n\nKraigg Brathwaite was bowled (Steven Paston/PA)\n\nAtkinson greedily snapped up two more, Alzarri Joseph and Shamar Joseph both trying and failing to slog their way out of trouble, before Anderson finished things off by trapping Seales lbw.\n\nThe crowd sang his name as one but it was Atkinson who led the team from the field.\n\nSeales returned fire when he had Ben Duckett caught behind for three but England stamped their authority with a stand of 94 between Crawley and Pope.\n\nBoth men survived big lbw appeals from Holder on their way to fifty, sharing 19 boundaries as they went.\n\nHolder finally got a decision to go his way when he pinned Pope in front of leg stump and Seales yorked Crawley as he began to eye a century, leaving Joe Root and Brook in place at the close.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But so quickly, so literally? It felt indecently hasty, but thrilling all the same.\n\nBy taking seven for 45 to skittle West Indies for 121 on his first day of Test cricket, Atkinson did not simply steal the headlines from a bowler who made his own debut when Atkinson was just five. He conjured up a vision of the post-Anderson years, in which the uplands may prove more sunlit than widely feared.\n\nThis was just the beginning, and there will be tougher tests ahead, in less helpful conditions, against more resilient line-ups. But in 147 years of Test cricket, only Dominic Cork in 1995 - also against West Indies at Lord's - has produced better figures for England in his first Test. Whatever the caveats, it was historic stuff.\n\nAtkinson was fast, hostile and - with the exception of an over in which Alzarri Joseph smashed four fours - economical: the very qualities with which Stokes and Brendon McCullum plan to hit Australia in 16 months' time.\n\nGus Atkinson (right) had a dream opening day of his Test debut as he took seven wickets\n\nJimmy Anderson (right) had to settle for just one wicket in the first innings of his farewell Test\n\nEngland's fielding was excellent, with harry Brook taking a stunning one-handed catch as West Indies were skittled for 121\n\nAnd the triple-wicket maiden he produced half an hour after lunch, when a brittle West Indies began their demise from 88 for three, confirmed why he had earned a Test cap after just 19 first-class matches.\n\nAlick Athanaze prodded a rapid delivery to Joe Root at first slip, before Jason Holder - first ball - was hurried into a leading edge to Harry Brook at third. Joshua Da Silva survived the hat-trick, but was then beaten by seam movement back down the slope, providing Atkinson's Surrey colleague Jamie Smith with his first catch as England wicketkeeper.\n\nIn the morning, Atkinson had bowled Kraigg Brathwaite off a thick edge with his second ball, and had Kirk McKenzie caught in the slips with his 14th. It all meant he was on the Lord's honours board after just 53 deliveries; Shane Warne spent 944 trying and failing to do the same. The wickets of the two Josephs - Alzarri and Shamar - were a bonus.\n\nAs Atkinson quietly, almost sheepishly, ascended the pavilion steps, it felt as if England had found the only cricketer in the land more reluctant to embrace the limelight than Anderson. He may get plenty of practice in the years to come.\n\nA day that ended with England in complete control at 189 for three, thanks to half-centuries from Zak Crawley and Ollie Pope, had begun with a standing ovation for a man playing his 188th and final Test. As Anderson's daughters, Lola and Ruby, rang the bell in front of the Bowlers' Bar - where else? - there might even have been a tear in dad's eye.\n\nZak Crawley looked in fine touch as he hit 76 before being bowled by Jayden Seales\n\nOllie Pope also played nicely for his 57 as England moved into a first innings lead\n\nLike the crowd, the clouds had gathered, as if in his honour. Yet the long goodbye made a slow start: nine off the first over was the most expensive to begin a Lord's Test since 2007. And while Anderson soon tidied up his figures, neither he nor the rusty Chris Woakes could extract much joy from a sluggish surface.\n\nThere has been plenty of anguish about Anderson's enforced departure, but a lot of it - understandably - has been based on sentiment. His recent seven-wicket haul for Lancashire against Nottinghamshire made eyes only mistier.\n\nBut just once in the last 16 Test innings has he taken more than two wickets, and the West Indians handled him and Woakes with greater ease than they did Atkinson and Stokes.\n\nThe captain's eight-over spell before lunch provided heartening confirmation that his left knee has responded well to surgery, and brought him the wicket - his 199th - of debutant opener Mikyle Louis, who in 2022 turned out for Stokes's old club side Cockermouth. The balance his bowling brings to the side already looks invaluable. Shoaib Bashir's off-breaks were not required.\n\nJoe Root was unbeaten on 15 at the close of play, with England in the lead by 68 runs\n\nHarry Brook ensured England didn't lose any momentum as he hit a brisk 25 not out\n\nWoakes did tick off 150 Test wickets, but he needed a stunning catch at a shortish point by Pope as Kavem Hodge got hold of a square cut. Two championship games for Warwickshire last month brought Woakes one wicket for 220, and now he hovered below 80mph. Dillon Pennington and Mark Wood are waiting in the wings.\n\nAnderson was not to be denied entirely, picking up Test wicket No 701 when he swung one into the pads of the left-handed No 11 Jayden Seales. That prompted a chorus of \"Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy\" from spectators who, at 10.30am, had cheered Stokes's decision to bowl.\n\nAt that stage, there was only one show in town. But Atkinson's star turn was followed by a lively second-wicket stand of 94 in 19 overs between Crawley and Pope, who was in need of runs after tailing off in India over the winter.\n\nPope was eventually trapped for 57 by a full-length delivery from Jason Holder, before Crawley - still growing in stature - was brilliantly yorked by Seales for 76 from 89 balls. England's run-rate of 4.72 confirmed a dominant day, but could not eclipse the performance of Atkinson.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

He tweets at @mroller98\n\nThey came for James Anderson, but they got Gus Atkinson. The first Test of England's summer at Lord's was meant to be a farewell for their greatest-ever seam bowler, but West Indies' batters rolled out the red carpet for a debutant instead: they collapsed from 88 for 3 to 121 all out, with Atkinson taking remarkable figures of 7 for 45.\n\nAtkinson took two wickets in his first 14 balls on the first morning, but it was his second spell that sent West Indies into a tailspin. He took three wickets in four balls in his ninth over, ripping the heart out of West Indies' middle order, then took two in three during his 11th. His figures were the second-best by an England bowler on their Test debut, behind only Dominic Cork.\n\nAnderson, playing his 188th and final Test, bowled nine wicketless overs before lunch and was brought back to take the final wicket of the innings, trapping Jayden Seales lbw to a loud ovation from the Lord's crowd. But it was Atkinson, the Surrey fast bowler, who led England off the field midway through a remarkable first day as a Test cricketer.\n\nOn a slowish pitch, he was the quickest England bowler on show, repeatedly touching 90mph/145kph and maintaining an average speed around 86mph/138kph. He made subtle adjustments to his grip but generally used a scrambled seam, allowing him to move the ball both ways off the surface.\n\nEngland's overnight lead owed primarily to Zak Crawley's quickfire 76. He rode his luck at times during his innings but was vindicated for his attacking intent, scoring heavily either side of point and dragging through midwicket and square leg when West Indies dropped short. He fell 24 short of a fifth Test hundred, Seales knocking his leg stump back with an inswinging yorker.\n\nIt was Seales who made the initial breakthrough for West Indies, angling one across Ben Duckett who edged through to Joshua Da Silva. Crawley and Pope combined to good effect after a bad-light stoppage, scoring at nearly five runs per over. Both men fell before the close but Joe Root and Harry Brook remained unbeaten.\n\nAtkinson was one of two players handed their England Test caps on the first morning along with his Surrey team-mate Jamie Smith, having made his white-ball international debuts last year. He struck with the second ball of his first spell as Kraigg Brathwaite chopped onto his own stumps while attempting a leaden-footed slap through the off side.\n\nHe struck again in his third over, angling a full ball across the left-handed Kirk McKenzie whose thick outside edge flew quickly to Zak Crawley at second slip. Atkinson bowled with good pace, regularly touching 90mph/145kph, and after his first five-over spell he had figures of 2 for 2, with four maidens and a single scoring shot.\n\nAlick Athanaze and Kavem Hodge, the Dominican batters, added 44 in a partnership that spanned the lunch interval. But when Athanaze steered a low catch to Root at first slip, it sparked a dramatic slide: Jason Holder, playing his first Test in a year, was squared up first-ball and caught in the slips, before Da Silva's inside edge gave Smith his first Test dismissal.\n\nHodge saw three wickets fall in four balls while standing at the non-striker's end and decided it was up to him to drag West Indies to a respectable total, laying into a cut when Chris Woakes offered him some width. The ball flew straight off the middle of his bat, only for Ollie Pope to take a spectacular diving catch in tight at point. Hodge threw his head back in disbelief.\n\nAtkinson's figures were briefly dented by Alzarri Joseph, who hit four boundaries in five balls: two wristy whips through square leg, a textbook straight drive and a sumptuous lofted extra-cover drive which had his fellow Antiguan Vivian Richards standing to applaud from the hospitality boxes.\n\nBut he soon chipped one up in the air to mid-on to give Atkinson a sixth, and two balls later, Shamar Joseph was comically caught by Pope point, losing his footing while attempting to pull him through the leg side. Anderson wrapped up the innings with an inswinger which struck Seales straight in front.\n\nAnderson occasionally beat the bat but bowled a fraction too short, particularly in his first spell. He was applauded onto the pitch by the Lord's crowd when leading England out for the national anthem with his close family present, and his daughters Ruby and Lola ringing the five-minute bell on the pavilion balcony.\n\nBen Stokes, who opted to bowl under cloud cover, was able to send down eight overs after declaring himself fully fit having skipped the T20 World Cup to continue his rehabilitation from a knee injury. He removed Mikyle Louis, who played brightly on debut, thanks to an excellent diving catch from Brook at second slip.\n\nLouis, who became the first man from St Kitts to play Test cricket for West Indies, was handed his cap by Richards and played with a confidence that belied the fact this was only his eighth first-class appearance. He hit consecutive boundaries in Anderson's first over, which cost nine runs, and his 27 made him West Indies' top-scorer.\n\nBoth Crawley and Pope had surpassed him when the umpires took the players off for bad light in the evening session. Holder thought he had them trapped lbw but the Decision Review System saved both: Pope was given out but the inswinger was projected to miss leg, while Holder convinced Brathwaite into reviewing a not-out decision off Crawley which was upheld.\n\nHe did eventually trap an overbalancing Pope in front for 57, ending a second-wicket partnership worth 94 runs shortly after England had nudged into the lead. It was Pope's first 50-plus score in a Test since his 196 against India in Hyderabad and only his second against a red-ball in this English summer.\n\nShamar Joseph, playing a first-class match for the first time since spearheading West Indies' famous win at the Gabba, bowled nine wicketless overs and suffered from cramp. His namesake Alzarri, who has also spent the last six months playing T20, was short on rhythm and consistency: he bowled three no-balls and leaked 6.6 runs per over.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com",

So, without any further ado, let's check out more details about him!\n\nAngus Alexander Patrick Atkinson, born January 19, 1998, is an English professional cricketer who plays for the English cricket team and Surrey County Cricket Club. He is a right-arm fast bowler.\n\nThe right-hand batsman was born in Chelsea, London, England under the zodiac sign of Capricorn to his parents, Edward Tom Atkinson, who's widely known as founder of Padjet and Caroline Atkinson.\n\nUnfortunately his mother, Caroline passed away in a car accident in 2020. Gus Atkinson has two siblings, younger brother, Barnaby Atkinson and a younger sister, Isobel Atkinson.\n\nStanding at 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m), Atkinson made his first-class debut on 8 August 2020 for Surrey in the Bob Willis Trophy. He debuted in Twenty20 on 28 August 2020 in the T20 Blast and in List A on 22 July 2021 in the Royal London One-Day Cup.\n\nAtkinson's average speed of 143.68 kmph/89.38 mph in The Hundred was bettered only by Haris Rauf back in 2023. Atkinson is known for his lightning-fast pace and has clocked an impressive 95 mph in The Hundred.\n\nIn April 2022, he was bought by the Oval Invincibles for The Hundred. Atkinson was part of the Surrey team that won the 2022 County Championship and was retained by the Oval Invincibles for the 2023 season.\n\nIn September 2023, Atkinson signed a new multi-year contract extension with Surrey. In February 2024, he withdrew from his \u00a395,000 IPL contract with Kolkata Knight Riders after discussions with the ECB to manage his workload.\n\nAtkinson received his first senior England call-up in August 2023 for the ODI and T20I series against New Zealand. Witnessing his impressive performances, in December 2023, Atkinson received his first call-up to the England Test squad for their tour of India.\n\nIn June 2024, he was named in the Test squad for the West Indies series, making his Test debut on 10 July 2024, and achieved a 7-wicket haul in the match.\n\nFor the curious, the British national is unmarried and as of now there is no information available indicating that the cricketer is in any romantic relationship. He is single and unmarried.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsgrail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsGrail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reena_choudhary@thesportsgrail.com", "name": "Reena

Instead it was Gus Atkinson who milked perfect bowling conditions like a veteran to produce an unforgettable debut and lead the team off to a Lord's standing ovation.\n\nOnly the selectors had a better day than Atkinson, his seven for 45 from 12 overs the second best figures on debut for England and a dream outcome for Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum, who tapped Anderson's shoulder to give younger, quicker bowlers like him a decent run into the Ashes.\n\nAtkinson replayed the scenes of Lord's 21 years ago when a bowler called Anderson took five in his first game for England. He marked it with an Anderson-like reticence rather than Broadian exuberance. Perhaps one day in the distant future the Lord's shop will be selling merchandise marking the last Atkinson Test like they are for Anderson this week (commemorative bucket hat, \u00a330 thank you very much). In the here and now, what matters for England is that in Atkinson, Stokes has found a new weapon, which Rob Key outlined in March as this summer's aim.\n\nWest Indies were bowled out for 121, losing five for nought after lunch with Atkinson rocking them with three in four balls at a touch under 90mph, the level above fast medium that England define as the sweet spot. All he left for Anderson was no 11 Jayden Seales, wicket number 701 taken with a world weary shrug.\n\nIt was such a one-sided procession that England were in the lead with more than an hour of play left, Zak Crawley playing wonderfully but bowled by a beauty for 76 while Ollie Pope started his summer with a fifty but also did not go on. At 189 for three this feels like a one innings Test for England.\n\n\"Oh Jimmy, Jimmy\" still rang out, even a seven wicket debutant could not steal the day. It started with everyone in their seats early. Rousing cheers and \"come on Jimmy\" shouts rang out as he walked through the Long Room to lead England out before abruptly stopping at the pavilion doors while a video montage of his career was played. Chris Woakes and Joe Root exchanged glances knowing what Anderson would make of all the fuss.\n\nIt was only when his two daughters rang the morning bell that he choked on emotion. Anderson has enjoyed a great life, seeing the world, earning lots of money but there have been dark times leaving those two daughters behind for long periods of England duty or seeing them off in airport taxis after flying visits on tour. That is the bit the public do not see.\n\nHe was intent on making it as normal a day as possible. He started with a coffee run to Starbucks but he could not escape the occasion. An engraved top of the range Ping putter was a leaving gift (very Bazball), his kit makers sent embossed boots to wear, the velcro straps stitched with the date of his debut (left foot) and final match (right). Before play he spoke to Sky alongside Broad saying it felt like \"five minutes\" since his debut and made a remark all middle aged people can identify with. \"It's incredible how quickly it goes.\" Atkinson should listen.\n\nAt 10.15 Anderson handed Jamie Smith his cap, his 12th keeper in Test cricket and 112th new team-mate to get to know. His speech harked back to his first keeper, Alec Stewart.\n\nIt was a day for Surrey men at Lord's. An hour after lunch, Atkinson led the team off with Anderson in his wake. Stokes was beaming, judgement justified. The talk of the team is not averages, it is strike rates. Only twice in his last nine Tests has Anderson taken a wicket in his first spell and did not at all in the Ashes last summer. His strike rate since the start of 2023 is a wicket every 80 balls. This time he needed 64, the token wicket of Seales. It took Atkinson just two to land his first and he had five within 54, writing his name on the honours board before he'd probably had time to work out the way to the dining room.\n\nAnderson conceded nine from his first over, the heart rate taking a while to settle. He soon dropped into rhythm conceding just two in his next five overs but apart from the odd ball beating the bat, West Indies negotiated the opening salvo pretty well with Chris Woakes at the other end looking short of bowling.\n\nAtkinson was outstanding to left-handers, angling the ball across with a wobble seam making them play. He started with a right-hander, Kraigg Braithwaite dragging on a wide ball. His second was more regulation considering the pitch conditions, nipping it off the seam as Kirk Mckenzie edged to slip. Stokes bowled his first proper spell of eight overs as a reborn bowling allrounder and celebrated the wicket of Mikyle Louise thanks to Brook taking a stunner at third slip low to his right.\n\nIt was after lunch that Atkinson grabbed the game. Running in from the Pavilion End, elbows tucked in, light on his feet for a big guy, he put batsmen on the back foot. In his fourth over of the afternoon, Alick Athanaze edged to first slip, Jason Holder next ball to second. Joshua Da Silva kept out the hat-trick but not the following ball, which flicked the inside edge on its way to Smith.\n\nAtkinson clonked Alzarri Joseph on the head first ball, an over later had him caught off a slower delivery. The bouncer attack continued, Shamar Joseph top edging to backward point as Atkinson had seven. Another wicket would have given him eight and the best figures on Test debut ever, beating Albert Trott in the 19th century. Two fours by no 9 Gudakesh Motie spoiled that and with the last pair at the crease Stokes brought Anderson back in a moment of charity.\n\nMotie cut a wide ball for four, Anderson kicked the turf with his left foot, flicked his forelock out of his eyes with that 'can you believe it?' look of an old timer. His next over started with Seales on strike. He survived three in a row but the fourth hit him in front. Anderson waited for the review before wandering off. He had denied Atkinson an eighth but 30,000 people did not care. They had their Anderson wicket to go with the bucket hat.\n\nAfter West Indies had been rolled over during the cloudy first half of the opening day, Zak Crawley and Ollie Pope made hay with half-centuries in afternoon sun. For one of them it was just another fifty, for the other it was a major act of recuperation.\n\nPope had feasted on Ireland's medium-pacers before last summer's Ashes, gorging himself to the extent of 205. This fifty against West Indies was only his second since then, such has been the famine.\n\nPope is like an eager developer. He sees a piece of land and decides to throw up a house on it overnight, to present to the authorities a fait accompli. He appears to care little whether what he is building has foundations or not: he will rush it up as fast as he can.\n\nHe is 26 now, and England's vice-captain in Test cricket, but signs that he is calming down are few. The tin roof remains hot; he must put his bat on the ball from the outset; leaving it alone is not a serious option, except perhaps every tenth or twentieth ball, as a variation, rather than on the basis of its merits.\n\nPope's 196 in the opening Test last winter was of course as gorgeous as any building erected by the Raj. He set off at his usual giddy pace, and England's supporters followed giddily in his wake. In only four and a half hours - no longer - Pope rushed up a palace in Hyderabad that was fit to rank with surrounding ones erected by the Moghuls, complete with domes and towers, mosaics and gems, breathtaking in craftsmanship.\n\nThereafter? A cluster of mud-huts was all Pope could show for the rest of his five-Test series in India.\n\nWhether he could here and now resist the temptation to play a shot at every ball until his nerves had calmed was soon answered: off his first three balls nine runs, off seven balls 14 runs, off 12 balls 18 runs, then a slight throttling down to one run a ball. Most batsmen at the pavilion end at Lord's fall down the slope, led by their head; Pope seems to fall over himself to score off almost every ball.\n\nNeither Crawley nor Pope scored much in early season for their counties - such loyal citizens might have been too desperate to pay their first employers back - apart from Crawley's double-hundred at Taunton. Both are 26 years old. There was no Taj Mahal like Pope's in India but Crawley drove four fifties there. Having been England's most inconsistent batsman, he has made only one single-figure score since the last Ashes Test at Lord's. Were he a developer, he would be building a nice little estate of semi-detached homes.\n\nThe older Crawley gets, the more he grows into his role, while Pope stalls, halts, hesitates, then hurls himself forward in his desperate desire to succed. As England are building their team for the Ashes, Crawley looks a certain bet to be listening to \"Advance Australia Fair\" on the first morning in Brisbane next November.\n\nPope at three? Not quite so certain at present. Truth is he has yet to pin down number three. Shorn of his double-hundred against Ireland he averages 37 there, which is not conclusive.\n\nEngland's head coach Brendon McCullum forecast that Crawley would never be consistent because he was not that sort of player but an initiative-seizer, yet he has been taking longer strides than Pope. He was averaging as little as 26 in his wildly inconsistent days but yesterday's innings - featuring, as usual, most handsome driving even when the bowlers pitched wide - took him up to 33, and his best is surely to come.\n\nIn case you missed it this morning, the Anderson family had the honour of ringing the five-minute bell before the start of play in James' final Test match.\n\nGus Atkinson has stolen the headlines with seven wickets on debut today but remember it is James Anderson's last Test match and he did take his 701st Test wicket today. He is now just seven behind Shane Warne but it looks unlikely now that he will be able to reach Warne.\n\nWe have had to wait until July for the start of the English Test summer but Ben Stokes and his side will be delighted with the way they have begun. A 68-run advantage with seven first wickets remaining is what you call a job well done.\n\nBrook is denied a lovely four as his straight drive crashes into the stumps at the non-striker's end. Holder gets one to tail back into Brook and the yorker nearly prevails. A sigh of relief for Brook, who then responds next ball with a drive through the covers for two. Brook flicks the final for two after a mis-field.\n\nThat is the end of day one and that has absolutely been England's day. What a day it has been for Gus Atkinson, a day he will never forget.\n\nRoot rocks onto the back foot as he does so well against spin and punches one into the covers for two.\n\nThe clock has ticked round to 6.51 but the umpires believe everyone was in position before it ticked round and we will have one more over.\n\nJason Holder has switched ends and is now coming on at the Pavilion End. Depending on how long this over takes it could be the penultimate over of the day.\n\nBrook flicks one off his legs for two to deep square-leg. Three from the over and we may only have time for one more over, although it will be spin.\n\nWe are going to have spin for the first time on day one as left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie is coming on from the Nursery End. In typical cricket style we have a short delay as a couple of helmets are coming out.\n\nA good stop from Alzarri Joseph at backward point prevents a boundary for Root. He also probably did not fancy the chase so a good job he stopped it! Just one run comes from that over.\n\nStuart Broad has just been speaking on Sky about his week. He was at Silverstone for the British Grand Prix last Sunday, Wimbledon for the tennis and the Lord's today. Not a bad week at all! Not at all jealous!\n\nBack on the field Brook picks it up over mid-on but it plugs so he only gets a couple. Off the penultimate ball Brook pulls past Joseph for another couple. Then off the final ball he emphatically flicks through mid-wicket for four.\n\nUp on the balcony captain Stokes has his pads on but surely with 10 minutes left there will be a nightwatchman padded up as well. Presumably it would be Atkinson. I cannot imagine Anderson will have his pads on.\n\nSeales' spell is over and Jason Holder is brought back into the attack. 20 minutes remain on day one. Root takes a quick single to wide mid-on and is home safely. Brook then waits on a Holder delivery outside off stump and guides it beautifully to wide third-man for four.\n\nHere is your update on Shamar Joseph; he is back on and bowling again! Brook flicks him away for a couple into the leg-side. Brook finishes the over with his first boundary as he sends Joseph to the cover boundary for four.\n\nEngland's lead is up to 43 runs.\n\nHaving said Shamar Joseph got through the over unscathed, he has now walked off after the conclusion of that over. We will keep you updated with any news on whether that is just cramp or injury.\n\nRoot gets a couple with a push into the covers. He then gets a little lucky with an inside edge that makes its way to fine-leg. Brook is off the mark off his fourth ball with a single tucked into the leg-side.\n\nOne Joseph comes on for another at the Pavilion End as Shamar re-enters the attack. This is concerning for the visitors as just one ball into the over he is down. It may be cramp though in his groin rather than an injury. A member of the Windies medical staff has come on to give him some treatment and it looks like all is well as he will be able to continue. He is able to get through the rest of the over unscathed.\n\nTwo Yorkshiremen at the crease as Harry Brook joins Root in the middle with just under 40 minutes remaining on day one. Brook did not tour India earlier this year due to personal reasons so this is his first Test match of 2024.\n\nCrawley b Seales 76 Crawley once again fails to convert a fifty into a century. It is a very good ball to dismiss him though as a Seales yorker gets underneath his bat and crashes into the stumps. FOW 153/3\n\nThat is a stunning bit of bowling from Jayden Seales to dismiss Zak Crawley, and a celebration to match. A. moment of magic for the Windies towards the end of a trying day.\n\nAlzarri Joseph has been expensive today and he concedes four runs, but that was a terrific shot from Crawley who flicks through mid-wicket for four down the hill. After making a number of good starts in India without converting them into big scores, Crawley and England will be hoping he can kick on here and as I type that Crawley is nearly out! He goes for another drive but this time it finds the outside edge. It goes through the vacant third/ fourth slip area and away for four. Crawley then flashes again and it flies past gully for a second streaky four of the over.\n\nEngland's lead is now up to 27 runs and time for drinks.\n\nRoot gets his first boundary of the innings with a late cut past backward point for four. If I were the West Indies fielding coach, I would be livid with Motie. He gave up on it pretty early into the chase and by the time he realised he might be able to get to it it was too late.\n\nOff the final ball Root feels for it outside his off stump but fortunately makes no contact with the ball.\n\nCrawley powerfully dispatches Alzarri Joseph on the up through cover for four. He managed to hit that on the top of the bounce, helped out massively by his height there.\n\nEngland's lead is now nine runs.\n\nMany thanks Rob, great work today. I will be taking you through to the close, which is likely to be at 6.51pm as predictably not all the overs will be bowled. Joe Root strides to the crease, his Test average a tick under 50. In typical Root style he is off the mark quickly with a single off his second ball.\n\nPope LBW b Holder 57 Pope flicks Holder for four to give England the lead, but then he's trapped in front by a beautiful yorker! Pope reviews more in hope than expectation that the bat scraped the ball on its way through.\n\nThere's nothing on UltraEdge and he's on his way for a very busy 57. Jason Holder deserves that wicket. FOW: 123/2\n\nWith that, it's time for me to hand over to Kieran Crichard for the rest of the day. Thanks for your company, goodnight.\n\nA change of bowling, and of Joseph, with Alzarri back on in place of Shamar.\n\nBoth batsmen reach their half-centuries. Pope squirts to the third man boundary to get there from 70 balls, Crawley pulls his 74th ball for four to join his club.\n\nAnother challenging over from Holder, who is shaping the ball away enough to make England wary of anything full.\n\nShamar's line is a bit awry: too straight to Pope, which brings four leg-byes, then too wide to Crawley, who laces him to the cover boundary.\n\nCrawley has been England's form player in the last 12 months and he's now one away from a fifty.\n\nHolder is the least sexy of this West Indies attack but he's been the pick today. He has another moment of misfortune when Crawley edges wide of second slip for four; Holder's figures of 5-0-18-0 are, if not a complete lie, then certainly economical with the truth.\n\nA very full delivery from Shamar hits Pope on the pad as he falls over. West Indies go up instinctively for LBW but soon realise it was sliding down. Pope can't reach a very wide ball that keeps low, then flicks an attempted yorker for two. This is his highest Test score since the 196 at Hyderabad.\n\nThese are still very good bowling conditions, and for now England are playing watchfully against Shamar and Holder.\n\nShamar Joseph starts after the break with a really good maiden, including a scrambled seamer that rips to hit Pope in the stomach.\n\nOff for bad light, which feels a bit hasty. Although those with tickets for day four and five might not mind it too much.\n\nThe umpires tell the West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite that he needs to bowl spinners if he wants to stay on. He politely declines and the players wander off the field.\n\nCrawley is beaten twice by Holder, clatters a square drive for four and then survives a big LBW appeal. Holder pleads with his captain to review, which he eventually does. I think this is out.\n\nOh no it isn't: it came back beautifully to hit Crawley in line but it did too much and was also too high.\n\nA terrific over from Holder, who is somehow still wicketless. It's very gloomy at Lord's now so don't be surprised if England are offered the light soon.\n\nIn Turkey, if you construct a house overnight, you can keep the land it is built on. Thus does Ollie Pope build his innings, as rapidly as possible, without too much regard to whether the house has foundations or not. Just rush it up!\n\nPope opens the face to glide another boundary of Shamar, who hasn't quite settled. He's still bowling some dangerous deliveries, including a beautiful outswinger that vrooms past Pope's outside edge.\n\nEngland trail by 37 runs.\n\nIt might take Shamar Joseph a while to work out English conditions. Some great fast bowlers have found it tough on their first tour.\n\nHolder has been here a few times and is bowling nicely from wide on the crease, shaping the ball away. But when he errs slightly in length, Pope spanks a cut for four.\n\nWest Indies think they've got Pope caught behind pushing at one of those full outswingers. It's given not out and they conclude that Pope's bat scraped the ground. Technology confirms they were right.\n\nCrawley, who has such a good record against high pace, drives Shamar sweetly for three. Pope has started mistiming a few and snaps his head back in frustration when a mistimed cut almost goes back onto the stumps. At times Pope is too harsh on himself, in a manner that reminds me a little of Mark Ramprakash.\n\nThe floodlights are back on, good news for West Indies' bowlers. Kraigg Brathwaite makes a double bowling change, introducing Jason Holder at the Nursery End, and Pope defends a couple of the balls before driving wristily to the left of mid-on for four. What a beautiful shot.\n\nPope then whips around a full delivery, bowled from wide on the crease, and is given out LBW. Pope hangs his head but Crawley encourages him to review - and replays show it was missing leg stump!\n\nThis is Shamar's third Test and only his eighth first-class match. He has an immediate impact, skidding his first ball past Pope's inside edge and then tempting him into a risky drive that flashes wide of third slip at catchable height.\n\nLife is never dull when Shamar Joseph has the ball. An eventful first over ends with Crawley playing a beautiful back-foot drive for four. England are racing along at nearly five an over.\n\nRight, stop what you're doing and pay attention for the next 20 minutes: Shamar Joseph, the ball of charisma who routed Australia in January, is coming on to bowl.\n\nAnother short ball from Alzarri is pulled smoothly round the corner for four by Pope, who is then hit in the breadbasket by an affronted reply. Turns out it was a no-ball, though that's no consolation to Pope's abdomen. He has 24 from 18 balls, Crawley 26 from 49.\n\nCrawley has been slightly stuck either side of tea, with only two ruins from his last 19 balls.\n\nAnother high octane start by Ollie Pope but there is no scoreboard pressure so he can play almost as he wishes. It would look much more frenetic if England were 20-1 against Australia and 2-0 down. And it would be nice if, for once, he played himself in calmly after an unproductive red-ball season - and an unproductive stretch since his masterpiece 196 in the first Test against India.\n\nPope clips Seales for a single to bring up England's fifty. Whatever happens in his Test career - and he still needs runs - you have to admire his relentless positivity.\n\nCrawley punches stylishly for two, misses another attempted pull and almost offer a return catch with a leading edge that drops short.\n\nNope, it's Alzarri Joseph to continue for the time being, and he beats Crawley with a cracking delivery outside off. This is a decent score for England because batting remains far from easy, even with the sun creeping through the clouds.\n\nA maiden from Alzarri ends with Crawley missing an attempted pull. The pitch looks a bit two-paced when the bowlers bang it in.\n\nPope carries on merrily, swivel-pulling Seales for four with authority. It might be time for Shamar Joseph.\n\nAlzarri Joseph starts the evening session with a benevolent long hop to Pope, who puts it away past backward point for four. That gets Pope going and he drives two handsome boundaries through mid-off and extra cover.\n\nPope gets lucky when a top-edged pull lands well short of long leg. Pope has made his usual eventful start, 14 from 7 balls.\n\nThis feels like a big innings for Ollie Pope. He has a good record at No 3, but since his 196 in Hyderabad - truly one of the great England innings - he has been very quiet, even for Surrey, for whom he normally churns runs for fun. He's the shakiest member of the top six currently, so a score would be welcome.\n\nBen Duckett batted like a man with one innings to his name since April when he became the first England wicket to fall on an otherwise blemish free day for the side.\n\nDuckett was caught behind driving for three having been dropped on one as England replied to West Indies' 121 all out.\n\nBut the batting will be secondary to the bowling after Gus Atkinson's dramatic debut launched the Test summer. Set against Wimbledon and the Euros, cricket needed something special at Lord's and it was delivered by the young Surrey quick Atkinson who muscled Jimmy Anderson out of the way to steal centre-stage.\n\nAtkinson's seven for 45 are the second best figures on debut for England. His triple-wicket maiden after lunch, which included three in four balls, was the first for England for 13 years as his pace, bounce and sideways movement was too much for batsmen groping on an English bowling day.\n\nAnderson had a last-man consolation, dismissing Jayden Seales leg before for two, but it was Atkinson who sheepishly led the team off, modestly holding up the match ball and looking down at the ground as if overwhelmed by the fuss. It was just like watching a young Jimmy Anderson doing the same here 21 years ago on his own debut.\n\nEngland trail by 91 runs after a dramatic session in which eight wickets fell in 21.4 overs. Five of them were taken by Gus Atkinson, who ended an unimaginably good first innings in Test cricket with figures of 7/45.\n\nThis is an important innings for Ollie Pope, who has struggled for county and country since that remarkable 196 in Hyderbad.\n\nA good over from Seales ends with an LBW appeal against Crawley that is turned down. Too high.\n\nThat's tea.\n\nDuckett c Da Silva b Seales 3 Ben Duckett falls cheaply. It was good bowling from Seales, full and wide enough to tempt Duckett into a fast-handed drive that he could only snick through to Da Silva. Duckett had been starved of the strike, facing only 13 of 44 deliveries; that may have played a part in his dismissal. FOW: 29/1\n\nCrawley makes Joseph bowl to him and clips crisply through midwicket for four. Mr Consistent is into the twenties again, though he groans with frustration after missing a wild drive later in the over.\n\nWest Indies are bowling well to Duckett, cramping him for room. Duckett forces a single into the off side before Crawley, flicking to leg, gets a leading edge that lands safely. There have been a lot of mistimed attacking strokes today.\n\nDropped him! Duckett slashes Alzarri to backward point, when the debutant Louis puts down a relatively straightforward chance. If you include the run-out opportunity in the first over, both openers have had a life.\n\nCrawley almost offers another chance when a mistimed pull clears mid-on and runs away for four.\n\nThe first boundary of the innings is a thick edge for four from Crawley. It was safe enough but well bowled by Seales.\n\nThere's no argument with the next ball, which Crawley larrups to the cover boundary. As Nasser says on Sky, that was very similar to the first ball of last summer's Ashes, albeit minus the primeval roar.\n\nDuckett tries to cut Alzarri and comes very close to dragging the ball onto his stumps. West Indies have made an excellent start with the ball, both disciplined and intense.\n\nJayden Seales shares the new ball and settles into a nice, attacking length. Crawley, who has been in very poor form this summer bar one mighty 238 against Somerset, punches a few drives without piercing the field. A maiden.\n\nHis second ball was not quite as good, a little wide. But as Kraigg Brathwaite moved to cut the ball, he was suckered by Lord's low bounce, and inside-edged the ball onto his stumps. A contented smile revealed that Atkinson had reduced the gap with Anderson's Test wicket tally to a mere 699.\n\nRead more...\n\nA run-out chance off the third ball of the innings. Crawley edges a sharp yorker from Alzarri Joseph along the ground to gully, where the ball is half stopped. Duckett calls for a run, then changes his mind, and Crawley is barely in the frame when Hodge's throw misses the stumps.\n\nThat's a cracking first over from Alzarri, with a bit of swing and everything in excess of 89mph.\n\nThe West Indies' pace attack against England's pace batters? This could be loads of fun.\n\n\"Oh Jimmy, Jimmy\" rang out at Lord's after he knocked over no 11 Jayden Seales but the day belonged to Gus Atkinson. His 7-45 are the second best figures on debut for England and he rather shyly led the team off the field, looking down at the ground as if embarrassed by the fuss, once briefly holding the ball up to the crowd before acidently dropping it on the ground. West Indies fell over in a heap but England needed this. They fielded superbly, Stokes's bowling changes worked and the debutant could not have bowled better.\n\nBen Stokes brought Jimmy Anderson back in search of the 10th wicket of this innings and 701st of his Test career, and they get their reward. England a little sluggish at first, but pretty much perfect thereafter: they caught brilliantly, and Gus Atkinson was electric. They didn't even waste any reviews!\n\nGus Atkinson leads England off after an extraordinary debut: 12-5-45-7. That includes a wicket with his second ball, three in four balls after lunch and then two in three.\n\nWest Indies lost their last seven wickets for 33.\n\nSeales LBW b Anderson 0 Jimmy Anderson gets his 701st Test wicket. The left-handed Seales plays around a perfect inswinger and is hit on the back pad. He reviews, but he knows. FOW: 121 all out.\n\nMotie thrashes Atkinson through the covers for four. Atkinson pushes him back with a bouncer, then beats him twice with fuller balls.\n\nMotie has the last word, at least for this over, with a zesty slap to the cover boundary. That means Atkinson can no longer take the best figures on Test debut overall, though he's still in with a shout for England.\n\nAnderson, back on for Woakes, is squirted for four by Motie. A quick single off the last ball means he'll keep the strike - and Atkinson will have the chance to make history.\n\nOne great day for England's Test cricket because of the debut by Gus Atkinson but one terrible day for Test cricket. Because it has been men against boys, given all the disparities between England's resources and those of West Indies. But bear in mind that West Indies still usually beat England at home...\n\nIt's worth repeating that another quick wicket will give Atkinson the best figures on Test debut for any country. He can't get it with the last three balls of the over, but Woakes permitting he'll be back.\n\nGus Atkinson: 11-5-37-7. Jimmy Anderson has played for 21 years without managing such figures.\n\n\"A seven-wicket haul on your first day as a Test cricketer?\" writes Will Macpherson. \"Ridiculous.\"\n\nAtkinson is the fifth bowler to take five wickets on debut under Ben Stokes. He just has this knack of making players feel relaxed and instantly part of the team. He takes away the worry and Atkinson looks like he's been around for years.\n\nS Joseph c Pope b Atkinson 0 This is bonkers. Shamar Joseph goes second ball for nought. He tried to pull, slipped and inadvertently launched the ball high towards backward point. Ollie Pope took a much more comfortable catch. FOW: 106/9\n\nA Joseph c Woakes b Atkinson 17 A sixth wicket for Gus Atkinson, who smiles sheepishly at the absurdity of it all. Alzarri Joseph tries another lofted drive and launches it miles in the air; Chris Woakes takes a comfortable catch.\n\nAtkinson has 6/36 and could still pick up the best figures on debut - for any country, not just England. The best is Albert Trott's 8/43. FOW: 106/8\n\nMotie, who looks content to play a supporting role to Alzarri Joseph, taps Woakes into the leg side to get off the mark.\n\nThe best figures for England on Test debut are Dominic Cork's 7/43 against West Indies on this ground in 1995, and I can't quite believe that's already up for discussion. Alzarri Joseph dents Atkinson's figures with three boundaries in a row: two wristy clips and a thumping, elegant straight drive.\n\nMake that four fours in the over after a cracking drive over extra cover. That's some response to being clattered on the grille first ball.\n\nAnd, while still standing outside the media centre, one could hear how perfectly middled Kavem Hodge's shot was. Stunning catch by Ollie Pope at silly point or at least short point.\n\nHodge c Pope b Woakes 24 Ollie Pope takes a stunning catch and West Indies have lost four wickets for no runs! Hodge savaged a wide ball from Woakes that looked four all the way, but Pope swooped to his left at short point to take a gasp-inducing catch. Hodge sinks to his knees in disbelief before dragging himself from the field. That's Woakes's 150th Test wicket. FOW: 88/7\n\nMy days, Atkinson completes a triple-wicket maiden with a nasty short ball that rams Alzarri Joseph in the grille. He'll need to be checked.\n\nThat gives the England players the chance to congratulate Atkinson, who has fantasy figures of 9-5-20-5.\n\nStanding outside the media centre, so I could hear the reaction of the crowd, the cheers for Gus Atkinson are fulsome... but slightly muted. Everyone is very pleased for him, but not so much on the part of those spectators who have tickets for days 3, 4 or 5.\n\nDa Silva c Smith b Atkinson 0 Josh Da Silva defends a pretty good hat-trick ball. But Atkinson is hunting a debut five-for at Lord's, just like Jimmy Anderson 21 years ago.\n\nAnd he's got it! Three in four balls and a five-for on debut! Da Silva inside-edged a cracking delivery down the leg side, where Smith plunged to his left to take a fine low catch. Wow. FOW: 88/6\n\nHolder c Brook b Atkinson 0 Gus Atkinson is on a debut hat-trick! Jason Holder has gone first ball, caught by Harry Brook. Holder was turned round and got a leading edge that was taken very nicely by Brook at third slip. FOW: 88/5\n\nAthanaze c Root b Atkinson 23 Beautifully done! Athanaze edges Atkinson to the right of first slip, where Root takes a superb low catch. It was a good ball from Atkinson, just back of length and angled across. Athanaze pushed at it and paid the price. FOW: 88/4\n\nA maiden from Woakes.\n\nAthanaze drives Atkinson classily through extra cover for four. This is only his fifth Test, and he has yet to make a fifty, but he looks a fine player - controlled as well as gifted. His shot selection so far has been exemplary. He and Hodge make a nice middle-order pair, a right-hander scrapper and a left-handed stylist.\n\nWoakes goes round the wicket to Athanaze and sends down a hooping inswinger. Athanaze drives it crisply whence it came and Woakes makes a good stop in his follow through.\n\nOne from the over, squirted nicely through point. Hodge was also beaten by the latest jaffa from the luckless Woakes.\n\nHodge takes on Atkinson again, top-edging a pull straight over the keeper's head for six! West Indies have definitely changed their approach; having scored 45 runs in the last 26 overs this morning, they've belted 20 off the first three since lunch.\n\nA double change after lunch, with Woakes also back into the attack. If all goes to plan for England, Shoaib Bashir will be a specialist fielder today.\n\nWest Indies have come out with much greater attacking intent. Athanaze plays successive off-drives for four, the first of which was a beautifully timed push. He looks a player.\n\nThe first ball after lunch is pulled brusquely for four by Hodge. Have some of that Gustopher!\n\nAtkinson takes his medicine, adjusts his length and bowls five pretty good dot balls.\n\nMove over James Anderson, enter Gus Atkinson. Two wickets in his first five-over spell in Test cricket perfectly exemplified why England are building for the future.\n\nAtkinson's first two balls were timed at 88 and 89mph, immediately injecting the pace needed at Test level and providing the \"weapons\" for Ben Stokes that director of cricket Rob Key identified as crucial in an interview with Telegraph Sport in March.\n\nAfter a wicketless opening spell for Anderson and Chris Woakes, Atkinson induced the drag on from Kraigg Braithwaite with his second ball and removed Kirk McKenzie with a more regulation delivery given the conditions - pitched up, outside edge to slip.\n\nEngland were right on the money almost a year since their last home Test match. They fielded superbly, and used the conditions well. Harry Brook's hard work on his athleticism paid off with a stunning one diving slip catch off Ben Stokes, who was back as frontline seamer for the first time in a couple of years. It was the kind of catch that Stokes himself would snaffle.\n\nWest Indies batting is full of promise, thin on experience and these were tough conditions on a day heavy with meaning for England. After 19 off the opening two overs (nine in Anderson's first), West Indies eked out 42 off the next 26 with scoring opportunities very limited. No wickets for Anderson but at just 2.2 an over he fashioned chances for others.\n\nA very encouraging return to bowling for Ben Stokes. No no-balls, and eight overs on the spin. He looks in great rhythm and picked up his 199th Test wicket thanks to that wonder catch from Harry Brook at third slip. Stokes himself would have been pleased with that catch.\n\nStokes goes round the wicket to test Athanaze with the short ball. He ignores that, then shapes to play an outswinger that doesn't miss off stump by much. I think he left it in the end.\n\nThat's the end of a good morning for England and particularly the debutant Gus Atkinson, who struck with his second ball in Test cricket and looked menacing throughout a spell of 5-4-2-2.\n\nAthanaze, who has looked the most comfortable of the West Indies batters this morning, works Anderson off the hip for another single. That gives Hodge to slap a rare bad ball from Anderson through backward point for four.\n\nNo sign of Jimmy getting grumpy yet, but it won't be long if he doesn't take a wicket. Looks like there will be time for one more over before lunch.\n\nAthanaze punches through the covers for three, the only runs from a slightly weary Stokes over. One more to go before lunch.\n\nA terrific inswinger from Anderson to Hodge is inside-edged past leg stump for a couple, with Shoaib Bashir scrambling to save the boundary.\n\nThere's almost a run-out chance when Hodge is sent back, but he has time to make his ground and the throw is off target anyway. \"Always a chance of a run-out at Lord's...\" says Nasser Hussain to his co-commentator Andrew Strauss, who was barbecued by Nasser on his debut 20 years ago.\n\nNo wickets yet but Anderson has been typically thrifty: he has figures of 8-3-15-0, and nine of those came off the first over.\n\nKavem Hodge is 31 years old, a late bloomer who made vital runs in that victory over Australia at the Gabba. This is only his third Test but he looks like he knows his game well; after defending solidly, he punishes a wide half-volley from Stokes with a blazing drive over backward point for four.\n\nA quiet over from Anderson.\n\nAbsolutely stunning catch from Harry Brook at third slip. He's worked a lot on his fielding and athleticism in recent months; that's his reward.\n\nThis might be tough to read, but that spell from Gus Atkinson explains why England are retiring James Anderson. England think they have an exciting crop of young bowlers, but don't want to go into next year's massive series against India and Australia and be dishing out debuts to them because Anderson has played a few more Tests. Atkinson looks the part - without a Stokes misfield he'd have had five maidens on the spin.\n\nThat Brook catch, though not quite in the same class, was reminiscent of Stokes's to get rid of Adam Voges at Trent Bridge in 2015. Stokes the bowler even did his own version of the Broadface, wide-eyed in joy and disbelief as he ran towards Brook.\n\nEngland have smothered West Indies, with the last 20 overs bringing 29 runs and three wickets.\n\nLouis c Brook b Stokes 27 Harry Brook has taken a blinder at third slip! Louis thick-edged the ball to the right of Brook, who showed sensational reactions to get down, grab the ball and stop it brushing the ground. That really is an outrageous catch, the kind Stokes usually takes. The debutant Louis goes after an impressive clear-headed innings of 27 from 58 balls. FOW: 44/3\n\nAnderson replaces Atkinson, who bowled a Boy's Own spell of 5-4-2-2. He starts with a maiden, including a textbook outswinger that beats Athanaze. There's one loose delivery down the leg side that is handled well by Smith; he's had a good mo\n\nThe tourists' number three batsman Kirk McKenzie has scored one first-class century - yes, one, a double-hundred but still only one - while their number four batsman Alick Athanaze has scored two first-class hundreds. At number six comes their allrounder Jason Holder, batting much higher than he has been for Worcestershire. Some contrast between the middle orders of the two sides. Is this series being played on a level field?\n\nStokes is working Louis over here. An inside edge flashes past leg stump for four, then the next ball growls off the seam to beat the outside edge. A masterful over from Stokes ends with a big inswinger that beats Louis' attempted drive and an outswinger that goes past his defensive push. Beautiful bowling.\n\nAtkinson's yorker is dealt with confidently by Athanaze. These two look like good players and should get plenty of runs in more favourable conditions.\n\nThat's four maidens for Atkinson in five overs; in fact the only runs he conceded came from a misfield.\n\nCrawley appeals alone for caught behind when Louis chases a tempting Stokes outswinger. \"There's only so much patience you can have as a batter...\" says Kumar Sangakkara on commentary.\n\nLouis is showing plenty and that's another maiden, the sixth of the morning.\n\nA misfield from Stokes at point gives Athanaze a couple, the first runs Atkinson has conceded. The next two deliveries, both immaculate in line and length, zip past the outside edge. Conditions are helpful but this is a cracking first spell in Test cricket.\n\nAs everyone has said, the return of Stokes the bowler is a game-changer for England. He's breezing in, no discomfort at all, and has found a good line to the right-hander. Louis is defending well but he has got a bit stuck, with only one run off his last 16 balls.\n\nThe left-handed Athanaze shovels an inswinger to leg to get off the mark.\n\nThere's rain in the air so the players might not be on for long. These are seriously tough batting conditions; the new man is the left-hander Alick Athanaze, a player given a rave review by Brian Lara.\n\nAtkinson's pace is excellent, in the high eighties, and Athanaze edges his first ball short of slip.\n\nTerrific stuff from Atkinson. Not many players from any country can have started their Test career with figures of 3-3-0-2.\n\nMcKenzie c Crawley b Atkinson 1 Welcome to Test cricket. Gus Atkinson has his second wicket - and he still hasn't conceded a run! The left-handed McKenzie drove at a full delivery, beautiful line, and edged it straight to Crawley at second slip. FOW: 36/2\n\nStokes replaces Woakes, whose first spell yielded 6-0-18-0. Stokes can make the ball hoop in moody conditions, as he did when he flattened West Indies with 6/22 on this ground in 2017.\n\nThere is a bit of movement to McKenzie, who plays tip and run to get off the mark from his 12th delivery.\n\nEngland continue to build pressure, with only 20 runs from the last 14 overs. Time for drinks.\n\nA sharp second over from Atkinson, another maiden, is defended well by Louis. He's been very impressive.\n\nNow it's time to have a look at emerging allrounder Ben Stokes.\n\nGus Atkinson spent five Tests in India doing little more than net bowling. Reports coming back from inside the camp described a very shy and quiet individual. A bit like a young Jimmy you could say. Nice touch to have Ollie Pope, rather than Anderson, present him with his cap. It would have been too much pressure, almost like anointing a successor, had Anderson done it.\n\nAtkinson lost his mother in a car crash in 2020, and naturally has been deeply affected by his loss. His father was in the huddle for the cap presentation which for the Atkinsons would have been as poignant and emotional as the Jimmy farewell montage was for the Andersons.\n\nWoakes is bowling really well now, getting movement in the air and off the pitch.\n\nMikyle Louis reviews successfully after being out caught behind off Woakes. It was a cracking delivery that squared Louis up and seemed to brush the outside edge, but there was nothing on UltraEdge. There was a noise, possibly bat on pad.\n\nAtkinson tries a yorker to the new batter Kirk McKenzie, who digs it out well. Atkinson starts his Test career with a wicket maiden.\n\nBrathwaite b Atkinson 6 Gus Atkinson strikes with his second ball in Test cricket! It wasn't the best delivery, not that he will or should care. Brathwaite threw his hands at a wide, fullish delivery - he won't be doing that again - and dragged it back onto the stumps. FOW: 34/1\n\nWest Indies will be very happy with the start. England a bit too short, and Chris Woakes not as consistent as normal in his line. James Anderson's first spell is done; now lets see how quick Gus Atkinson is.\n\nThe lights are on at Lord's, which makes batting even trickier. Woakes beats Louis with an absolute jaffa; Louis responds by flicking the next ball imperiously over square leg for six! Heckuva shot, that. And a pretty good response from Woakes, who beats the bat again with a beautiful delivery. Batting looks very tricky out there.\n\nMikyle Louis can play a regal front drive but why has he not been tested by real bouncers, even on a slow pitch? He was bounced out at Beckenham by Sonny Baker. Will have to wait until Gus Atkinson and some real pace?\n\nAnderson and Woakes were not quite on it first thing, but these last couple of overs have been much better. Not much for the Windies' openers to feed off at all.\n\nLouis is beaten by successive deliveries from Anderson. He's doing everything right, playing late and with soft hands, but the odd play-and-miss is an occupational hazard. There's a strangled shout for LBW when Louis inside-edges an inducker onto the pad, and finally an inside-edge flies past leg stump for a single. A fine over from Anderson, who has conceded only two runs off his last four overs.\n\nStuart Broad, in his new role as Sky commentator, says Chris Woakes has bowled slightly short. When he does go a bit fuller, Brathwaite is turned round by a jaffa that snaps past the outside edge.\n\nA surprise bumper from Anderson is pulled for a single by Louis, who is going along a decent rate. He has 14 from 16 balls, Brathwaite - who aims to be out there for a long time, not a good time - has 4 from 26. He offered no stroke to a lovely inswinger from Anderson that didn't miss off stump by much.\n\nFor a 23-year-old making his Test debut at Lord's after only seven first-class games, Mikyle Louis has looked very calm. When he waves absent-mindedly outside off stump and is beaten by Woakes, he gets immaculately in line to defend the next ball. No sign that the beans are going, as Nasser would say. And when Woakes' last ball comes out all wrong, Louis clatters it safely over backward point for four.\n\nBrathwaite is beaten by successive deliveries from Anderson, who is into his work and has now bowled back-to-back maidens. (The only run in that over was a leg-bye.)\n\nEngland go up for LBW when Louis pushes around a straight one from Woakes. It's given not out and Ben Stokes decides not to risk a review. It was probably going down and it might have been high; yep, replays confirm it was missing on line and length.\n\nWoakes is averaging 220 in first-class cricket this summer so he'd like an early wicket or two. He almost gets it with a gorgeous delivery that straightens sharply to beat Brathwaite and then swings sharply after passing the bat. Smith dealt with it well - and the next ball too, which was speared down the leg side.\n\nAn excellent second over from Anderson - a Spandex-tight line and with a bit of movement back into Brathwaite, who has to play at every delivery. It's a maiden.\n\nAnderson's pace is good, between around 83-85 mph.\n\nChris Woakes shares the new ball. He's had a difficult summer, with the death of his father followed by some wicketless performances in the County Championship, but his record at Lord's is outstanding.\n\nWoakes' first ball is too straight and clipped for two by Brathwaite. The ball is swinging, albeit fairly gently, and Brathwaite - one of the last practitioners of the art of batting time - is leaving wherever possible. Woakes overcompensates and the ball runs away for four leg-byes. The pitch looks really slow.\n\nMikyle Louis must be the tallest Test opener since... Zak Crawley?! A couple of big boys at the top of the order in this game (and, in Ben Duckett, one very little one). He's made a decent start.\n\nAnderson starts with four slips for Brathwaite, who pushes the first ball into the off side for a single. That brings the debutant Mikyle Louis on strike: this is only his eighth first-class match but he's already scored three hundreds.\n\nLouis defends a couple of outswingers very solidly, then gets a thick edge for four to get off the mark. He played it pretty well, softening his hands to ensure the edge went straight down.\n\nHe plays the next ball even better, timing a sweet push-drive past mid-off for four. An expensive first over from Anderson, though there was nothing wrong with it.\n\nThe first over will be bowled by Jimmy Anderson.\n\nFor all their vastly differing resources off the pitch, in the last decade, this has been one of Test cricket's most compelling - and even - rivalries. Since 2015, England have won two series against West Indies - both 2-1, at home - lost two in the Caribbean and drew one. Overall score: 6 wins apiece. This is one of the best attacks West Indies have fielded in that time, though there are plenty of questions about the batting.\n\nAfter that lovely video, Jimmy Anderson leads England onto the field with a slightly shy smile. It looks like he's fighting pretty hard to hold back the tears. And it's about to get even harder, because his children have been invited to ring the bell to signal the start of play. I've never seen anything quite like this, certainly not on the first morning of a Test. I think the fact Anderson wants to play on has enhanced what was already going to be a hugely emotional occasion.\n\nJimmy Anderson looking very serious - stern face, crossed arms - as he waits to lead England out. It looks like the teams have misjudged the moment that they were coming out. This is an unusual start to a Test - he's currently watching a montage about himself! Will test his stiff upper lip.\n\nRead more...\n\nYep, that's right. Now if you can just name the 13 white-ball keepers...\n\nWest Indies also have a debutant. The exciting young opener Mikyle Louie becomes the first man from St Kitts to play Test cricket for the West Indies. The only slight surprise is that Gudakesh Motie is preferred to Kevin Sinclair as the spinner.\n\nEngland Crawley, Duckett, Pope, Root, Brook, Stokes, Smith (wk), Woakes, Atkinson, Bashir, Anderson.\n\nWest Indies Brathwaite (c), Louis, McKenzie, Athanaze, Hodge, Holder, Da Silva (wk), A Joseph, Motie, S Joseph, Seales.\n\n\"Everyone will like this, we're gonna have a bowl!\" says Ben Stokes. His opposite number Kraigg Brathwaite says West Indies would also have bowled.\n\nIf this doesn't make you smile, I'm not sure what will.\n\nWe've just had a pair of cap presentations in the England huddle. Ollie Pope handed his mate from the Surrey academy Gus Atkinson his cap, number 714, which completes the set of Test, ODI and T20 caps. And then James Anderson gave Jamie Smith his cap. Anderson is 613, and Smith will be the last player to debut alongside him. He's played with a lot of Test cricketers!\n\nRead more...\n\nGood morning from Lord's, where there's that familiar buzz of activity on a busy outfield. It's a bit close today, but we should get a full day's play. Expecting a slow pitch, as has been the way this year. It's straw-coloured, with not much grass visible (from 100 yards away at least). They're selling Jimmy Anderson farewell merch on the concourse - \u00a360 for a hoodie.\n\nThe pitch looks fairly dry on the surface but the cloud at present is almost unbroken and the whole summer has been so wet that any neutral supporter will want England to bat first. West Indies batsmen are so inexperienced in these conditions that they could be dismantled by Jimmy.\n\nStuart Broad joined the Vaughany & Tuffers Cricket Club to discuss the retirement of his great mate Jimmy Anderson and much else besides.\n\nHello and welcome to over-by-over coverage of the first Test between England and West Indies. Lord's in July feels like The Oval in September*: it's the opening Test of the summer, yet it's also a grand farewell to James Anderson, who will play his 188th and final Test after getting a tap on the shoulder from Old Father Baz.\n\nIt all feels a bit strange, not least because Anderson has made it abundantly clear that he'd like to play on past his 42nd birthday, maybe even until the Ashes in 2025-26. There will be tears, shyness and hopefully plenty of outside edges.\n\nThe match itself could be great fun. West Indies' last Test was a spectacular win over Australia at Brisbane in January, and even without their old don Kemar Roach, they have an enviable pace attack. England need to get some wins on the board - their last series victory was in Pakistan at the end of 2022, though we shouldn't lose sight of how brilliantly they played for much of last summer's drawn Ashes. They are still a team we should be proud of.\n\nAnd we can no longer accuse them of pigheaded loyalty. This isn't quite Bazball 2.0, but it's the first time Brendon McCullum, Ben Stokes and Rob Key have picked two debutants who they see as long-term investments. Jamie Smith will keep wicket in place of the original Bazballer, Jonny Bairstow, and Gus Atkinson has been hailed from a congested cab rank of fast bowlers.\n\nStokes made it clear the Ashes is his priority. \"I want us to be able to take a squad out there that will go at Australia,\" he said. \"I'll be nearly four years as captain when we go out there, I want to go out there knowing we've done everything possible over this 18-month period to go out there with a strong enough squad to not just compete with Australia, but to beat them.\"\n\nEngland XI Crawley, Duckett, Pope, Root, Brook,

The greatest two and a bit decades of English seam bowling in history are nearly over, man, and for a mere \u00a360 punters could get their hands on a commemorative hoodie.\n\nHow long Anderson's grand farewell lasts may hinge on the weather in St John's Wood over the coming days, England having dominated the early exchanges against West Indies. They also did so in a manner that lent weight to the decision by Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum to reboot the Test side this summer, with the newcomer Gus Atkinson bursting out of his cellophane wrapping to take seven sparkling wickets.\n\nSideways glances might have followed had Anderson dominated proceedings at the start of this 188th and final Test match. Although the 41-year-old was not exactly sidelined. His greatest hits featured regularly on the big screen and his 701st Test wicket put a full stop on a rather sorry 121 all out from the tourists. His daughters, Lola and Ruby, ringing the bell at the Bowlers' Bar before play was a lovely moment, too, Anderson cracking a proud smile out in the middle that just about prevented a tear from forming.\n\nBut 21 years on from one shy, undemonstrative fast bowler announcing himself to the world with a place on the Lord's honours board, another cut from the same cloth repeated the trick. Atkinson, a smidgeon older than that early days Anderson at 26, claimed the third best figures by an England men's Test debutant - seven for 45 from 12 overs - with the slippery wicket-to-wicket nip that trumped just 19 first-class games for Surrey.\n\nThe skies over St John's Wood were bruised for most of the day and Stokes is a captain who rarely needs a second invitation to bowl first. Having seen their achilles heel - batting - exposed on a slow surface during the first half, the West Indies' clear strength - fast bowling - could not quite provide the requisite rush of wickets in response. Instead, England closed on 189 for three for a commanding overnight lead of 68 runs.\n\nThere were some bright moments from the tourists, not least Jayden Seales terminating Zak Crawley's sprightly 76 with a lasered yorker that knocked back leg stump. Seales had earlier nicked off Ben Duckett cheaply on the drive, while Jason Holder - twice thwarted by the review system - finally removed Ollie Pope lbw for 57 with an inswinger. But with Joe Root (15) and Harry Brook (25) set to resume first thing, they still have it all to do.\n\nWest Indies had started determinedly against Anderson and the returning Chris Woakes before the lacquer came off the Dukes ball and it started to move. Even after being pegged back by Atkinson's initial spell of five overs, two for two, plus a wicket for Stokes when Brook's humdinger of a low catch at slip removed the opener, Mikyle Louis, for 27, things appeared honours even. Stuck in by their hosts, they were 61 for three at lunch.\n\nAtkinson's early burst had seen just his second ball in Test cricket chopped on to the stumps by Kraigg Brathwaite - 10 minutes off strike inducing a loose cut from the West Indies captain - and Kirk McKenzie fenced to slip. What followed after the interval surpassed those early inroads, however, Atkinson utterly filleting the middle order with three wickets in four balls that turned the usual Lord's hum into a guttural roar.\n\nBrathwaite's early exit had taken with it 12 of the 16 Test centuries this West Indies side had scored previously and the other two batters to taste three figures, Holder and Joshua Da Silva, lasted just three balls between them. Once the tidy Alick Athanaze fell to Root at first slip on 23 - ending a 44-run stand with fellow Dominican, Kavem Hodge - and Holder offered half a bat to edge to third, Atkinson found himself on a hat-trick.\n\nDa Silva kept out the full, straight attempt but was sent on his way next ball when an inside edge flew behind. As well as sealing a maiden Test five-wicket haul for Atkinson - just his second in first-class cricket - it was a first catch for his Surrey teammate and fellow debutant, Jamie Smith. The 23-year-old kept pretty tidily overall, too, despite Lord's being a tricky ground for it and the ball rarely reaching him above waist height.\n\nIn between this surge and Atkinson wiping out the two Josephs - Alzarri and Shamar both skying catches in the final throes - came a wicket for Woakes. For some, the 35-year-old is a slight curio in this reshuffle; a bowler who, like Anderson, feels unlikely to make the targeted Ashes tour the winter after next. England still want a degree of continuity, however, and after some early jaffas that only found fresh air, Woakes finally removed the watchful Hodge for 24 thanks to a remarkable reflex catch from Pope at short cover.\n\nLike Brook earlier on - albeit with a more nonchalant celebration - it summed up a fine display in the field overall. Stokes sending down eight straight overs of thudding swing without any ill-effects from last year's knee surgery was another box ticked. It just needed a wicket for Anderson, with England and the capacity crowd finally having their collective wish granted when a full inswinger to Seales, the No 11, struck the back leg in front.\n\nAll told, it was the kind of day Stokes and McCullum will have had in mind when they tapped Anderson on the shoulder in late April: a worthy celebration of what has been a remarkable career and, in Atkinson's arrival, the promising first steps of a new one.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ali_martin@theguardian.com",

steals retiring James Anderson's limelight at Lord's", "body": "Debutant Gus Atkinson gatecrashed James Anderson's leaving party at Lord's, claiming stunning figures of seven for 45 as England blew away West Indies on day one of the first Test.\n\nThe home of cricket was primed to pay tribute to Anderson, lining up for his country for the final time after a record-breaking 22-year career, but instead witnessed Atkinson kickstarting a new chapter in breathtaking fashion.\n\nIn a true torch-passing moment, the Surrey paceman assumed centre stage as he toppled the tourists for 121.\n\nAnderson belatedly got in on the act, dismissing number 11 Jayden Seales to end the innings and give a sellout crowd the moment they came for, but Atkinson well and truly stole the show.\n\nEngland had assumed complete control by the close, moving into a 68-run lead as half-centuries from Zak Crawley (76) and Ollie Pope (57) left them 189 for three.\n\nBut the heavy lifting was done by Atkinson, who returned career-best first-class figures as he became the fifth bowler to claim a five-for on debut under Ben Stokes' captaincy.\n\nHe opened his account with his second delivery as a Test cricketer, added another before he had even conceded a run and then took three wickets in four balls during the afternoon session.\n\nHe was on course for the best figures by an English bowler on Test debut, denied only by a late boundary that left Dominic Cork's haul of seven for 43 in 1995 intact.\n\nWhile Anderson was upstaged at his own farewell event, he may have enjoyed a moment of nostalgia recalling his own debut five-for at the same ground back in 2003.\n\nThe country's record wicket-taker was everywhere at the start of play - staring out from the front of the matchday programme, featuring in a series of loving television montages and splashed in silhouette across a commemorative hoodie on sale at \u00a360 in the club shop.\n\nHis daughters Ruby and Lola even had the honour of ringing the five-minute bell at the start of the day.\n\nStokes gave fans what they wanted when he won the toss and opted to bowl first under cloudy skies, but all that was missing was an early breakthrough for the man of the moment.\n\nHe bowled tidily and beat the bat a couple of times in a five-over burst with the new ball but it was not until Atkinson took over that things began to happen.\n\nHis second ball was little more than a loosener but Windies captain Kraigg Brathwaite waved a crooked bat outside off stump and dragged down his own stumps.\n\nAtkinson soon touched 90mph on the speed gun and then picked up a more classical wicket, suckering Kirk McKenzie into a drive and seeing a thick edge sail through to slip.\n\nBy the end of his first spell he boasted pristine figures of 5-3-2-2.\n\nWest Indies struggled to 61 for three at lunch, Stokes accounting for debutant opener Mikyle Louis for 27 thanks to a brilliant one-handed slip catch from Harry Brook.\n\nThe skipper's reaction - open-mouthed and eyes bulging in shock - was reminiscent of Stuart Broad's meme-worthy response to an even more memorable Stokes catch in the 2015 Ashes.\n\nAtkinson returned to cause havoc after the interval, finding himself on a hat-trick in his ninth over as he pounded out an attacking channel and had Alick Athanaze and Jason Holder caught in the cordon.\n\nJosh Da Silva kept out a decent hat-trick delivery but succumbed to the next one, pushing forward and feathering through to give England's new wicketkeeper Jamie Smith his first catch and Atkinson a place on the honours board.\n\nA brilliant reaction catch from Pope did for Kavem Hodge - taking the score from 88 for three to 88 for seven in the space of eight balls.\n\nAtkinson greedily snapped up two more, Alzarri Joseph and Shamar Joseph both trying and failing to slog their way out of trouble, before Anderson finished things off by trapping Seales lbw.\n\nThe crowd sang his name as one but it was Atkinson who led the team from the field.\n\nSeales returned fire when he had Ben Duckett caught behind for three but England stamped their authority with a stand of 94 between Crawley and Pope.\n\nBoth men survived big lbw appeals from Holder on their way to fifty, sharing 19 boundaries as they went.\n\nHolder finally got a decision to go his way when he pinned Pope in front of leg stump and Seales yorked Crawley as he began to eye a century, leaving Joe Root and Brook in place at the close.", "source": {"uri": "falmouthpacket.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

The visitors started cautiously with captain Kraigg Brathwaite and debutant Mikyle Louis making sure to keep their wickets intact in the first ten overs.\n\nAfter James Anderson and Chris Woakes failed to provide the first breakthrough for England, Ben Stokes introduced Gus Atkinson into the attack for the 11th over and the pacer made an instant impact. In his very first over, the right-arm pacer dismissed Brathwaite to give England the much-needed first breakthrough. In the 15th over, he struck again to remove Kirk McKenzie for 1.\n\nHe then went on to complete a memorable 5-wicket haul on his debut in style by taking 3 wickets inside an over. In the 35th over, he first dismissed a well-set Alick Athanaze for 23 before sending back Jason Holder (0) and Joshua Da Silva (0) to complete his 5-wicket haul.\n\nThe 3 wickets inside an over saw West Indies getting reduced to 88 for 6 from 88 for 3. Later, he dismissed Alzarri Joseph and Shamar Joseph as well to finish the innings with brilliant figures of 7 for 45 in 12 overs. For West Indies, no batter could even touch the 30-run mark with debutant Louis' 27-run knock being the best effort as they were bowled out for 121.\n\nThe brilliant spell on debut has helped Gus Atkinson equal the English record for most wickets in an innings on debut.

The Three Lions invited the Windies to bat first and bowled them out for 121 in 41.4 overs. Debutant Gus Atkinson claimed 7/45 from 12 overs. In response, the hosts have taken a 66-run lead, having scored 189/3 at stumps.\n\nAtkinson began his Test journey in style with a wicket-maiden. He gave England their first breakthrough by dismissing West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite. He claimed a wicket off his second ball with full-length delivery outside off. The right-arm seamer didn't concede a run in his first three overs, dismissing Kirk McKenzie in his third. The latter was caught behind the stumps.\n\nIn the 35th over of the Windies innings, Atkinson broke a 44-run stand between Alick Athanaze and Kavem Hodge. Atkinson dismissed Athanaze by drawing him to poke at a length ball. He dismissed Jason Holder off the very next delivery. Atkinson completed his fifer by dismissing Joshua da Silva (0) in the same over. Alzarri Joseph and Shamar Joseph were his next victims.\n\nAtkinson bowled 12 overs which included five maidens. His economy rate was 3.80. Notably, the Surrey pacer was smoked for nine fours and a six on debut. The 45 runs conceded by Atkinson consisted of 42 runs in boundaries alone.\n\nAs per Cricbuzz, Atkinson now owns the 3rd-best bowling figures on debut for England. John Ferris (7/37 vs SA, Cape Town, 1892) and Dominic Cork (7/43 vs WI, Lord's, 1995) are ahead of Atkinson. Meanwhile, the likes of John Lever ( 7/46 vs IND, Delhi, 1976) and Alec Bedser (7/49 vs IND, Lord's, 1946) also claimed seven-wicket hauls on debut for England.\n\nJames Anderson picked up one wicket in the first innings of his farewell Test. Anderson claimecd the wicket of Jayden Seales to fold the Windies innings. Anderson claimed 1/26 from 10.4 overs. He bowled three maidens. Skipper Ben Stokes raced to 199 Test wickets. He bowled eight overs on the trot and conceded 14 runs. Chris Woakes claimed 1/29 from 11 overs.\n\nMikyle Louis was the top scorer for West Indies with 27 runs. He hit four fours and a six. Athanaze managed a 56-ball 23. Hodge scored 24 from 48 balls. Their partnership was key for Windies. Alzarri Joseph's 17 in the end helped WI.\n\nZak Crawley and Ollie Pope were massive for England. After the dismissal of Ben Duckett (3), Pope joined Crawley when England were 29/1. Thereafter, the two added a 94-run stand. Pope was dismissed for 57 from 74 balls. He hit his 12th fifty and surpassed 2,500 Test runs. Jason Holder trapped him LBW. Crawley hit a superb 76-run knock before Seales dismissed him.\n\nSeales has dismissed Crawley for the fourth time in Test cricket. As per ESPNcricinfo, across seven innings, Crawley has 82 runs at 20.50 against Seales. Crawley has faced 112 balls, striking at 73.21.\n\nJoe Root (15*) and Harry Brook (unbeaten on 25) saw the day out for England. Both players would be aiming to start well on Thursday in the morning session. Seales was the pick of the WI bowlers, claiming 2/29.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lord's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraigg_Brathwaite", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kraigg Brathwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caught"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Anderson_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Anderson (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-wicket_haul", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Five-wicket haul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lever", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Lever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Cork", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Cork"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Ferris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Richmond defeated Indiana and Georgia Tech that year in the NCAA tournament (loss to Temple). The Spiders returned to the NCAAs in Atkinson's senior year of 1990 (loss to Duke), during which he averaged 18.9 points as a captain.\n\nAgain, recalibrating\n\nNow, Atkinson once again intends to adjust his game after learning what has worked, and what has not. Atkinson, 57, was introduced as the Cleveland Cavaliers coach on July 1. His remarks included an emphasis on how his first job as an NBA coach, with the Brooklyn Nets, will fortify him in his new position.\n\nStrong relationships with players lead to individual and group development, according to Atkinson. \"If every individual gets a little bit better, that's now you make the next step,\" he said.\n\nAtkinson added that the ability to \"step back and put the players forward\" as program leaders is vital to the success of a coach, a lesson he learned through 15 seasons as a head coach and assistant in NBA organizations.\n\n'This is different'\n\nThe Nets went 118-190 with Atkinson as coach, and their best season was 2018-19, when they finished 42-40.\n\n\"I had the Brooklyn situation ... This is different. This is a fantastic roster (in Cleveland),\" said Atkinson, a UR hall of famer who averaged 34.5 minutes and scored 1,549 points in 125 collegiate games. \"I'm just coming here to give it a little more of a push.\"\n\nCleveland went 48-34 and advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals last season, but fired coach J.B. Bickerstaff after five years.\n\n\"This isn't some remake,\" said Atkinson. \"It always starts with the players.\"\n\nDesirable destination\n\nAtkinson praised the Cavaliers' culture, and said, \"If you're in this league long enough, you know which organizations are kind of building it the right way, and this is one of them. It's one of a handful of them.\n\n\"I knew if I ever had the opportunity to go for this job, I'm going to go for it, and I'm going to be aggressive.\"\n\nSpiders will speak with international accent, but these guys have NCAA experience\n\nAtkinson was dismissed in Brooklyn during March of 2020. He joined the staff of Los Angeles Clippers coach Tyronn Lue for the 2020-21 season, and spent the last three years as an assistant to Steve Kerr at Golden State.\n\nAtkinson has also been an assistant in Atlanta, and with the New York Knicks.\n\n\"I've moved around a lot. It's been enriching,\" he said. Atkinson said his time with Lue and Kerr pointed out to him, \"Man, there are so many things I can do better.\"\n\nIn Olympics, with France\n\nThe process continues this summer as Atkinson, who played professionally in France, is an assistant for the French national team participating in the Olympics.\n\nHis goal is two-fold, according to Atkinson: help win the gold medal for Team France and simultaneously become a better coach for the Cavaliers in an NBA that increasingly resembles the international game.\n\nBasketball gallery: Richmond vs. VCU, Feb. 3, 2024\n\nJohn O'Connor (804) 649-6233\n\njoconnor@timesdispatch.com\n\nJohn O'Connor\n\nUniversity of Richmond and Richmond Flying Squirrels Reporter\n\nAuthor twitter Author email Follow John O'Connor Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

James Anderson claimed his 701 Test scalp as the West Indies were bowled out for 121, and although it is too early to say the side has found the seamer's replacement, the Surrey fast bowler has laid down a marker.\n\nOnly one Englishman has finished with better figures on debut. It was Dominic Cork, also against the West Indies at Lord's back in 1995, and Atkinson's seven for 45 puts him 11 on the list for best figures on Test debut.\n\nHaving never played a first-class match at Lord's beforehand, Atkinson looked almost instantly at home, claiming the wicket of Kraigg Brathwaite, who played onto his own stumps with only his second ball in the format. The breakthrough came after 10 wicketless overs from the experienced Anderson and Chris Woakes at the start of the day after England won the toss and elected to bowl.\n\nIt is too early to predict Atkinson's future, but Anderson claimed five wickets on Test debut at Lord's, against Zimbabwe 21 years previously. Although there are few similarities between the two in terms of style, Anderson is a swing bowler, while Atkinson is more front-on and often favours the cross-seam delivery, bowling wicket to wicket, few make such an impression on their debut.\n\nAnderson took the final wicket of the innings as the West Indies were bowled out for a disappointing 121 inside the first two sessions of play.\n\nThe entire day was set to pay tribute to Anderson after 22 years of international cricket for England. His family rang the bell five minutes before play, and Lord's had a number of montages prepared for the big screen to showcase his achievements over more than two decades.\n\nAnderson did get in on the act, and the crowd responded, but it was a reminder that the occasion is not about one person, and instead, as England look to the future, they could have a new player to celebrate.\n\nBen Stokes and Brendon McCullum have not been unafraid to throw the ball to inexperienced players, and have often reaped the reward. Will Jacks took a five-for on debut during the first overseas tour of the Bazball era against Pakistan in Rawalpindi, and Rehan Ahmed did the same on his maiden appearance in the third Test of that series in Karachi.\n\nJosh Tonge took five wickets in a standalone Test match before the Ashes in the summer of 2023, and Tom Hartley took seven on his debut at Hyderabad. Atkinson is the latest to repay the England leadership for his faith in the next generation.\n\nWhen it came their turn to bat, England started in an uncharacteristically subdued fashion, but a 94-run partnership between Ollie Pope and Zak Crawley was put on in more typical Bazball fashion.\n\nPope made a useful 57 from 74 before he was trapped lbw by Jason Holder, who had had two lbw decisions overturned by DRS on review previously.\n\nCrawley made 76 before being bowled by Jayden Seales, and at the close of play, England were ____ runs ahead and ___ wickets down.", "source": {"uri":

leaving party at Lord's, claiming stunning figures of seven for 45 as England blew away West Indies on day one of the first Test.\n\nThe home of cricket was primed to pay tribute to Anderson, lining up for his country for the final time after a record-breaking 22-year career, but instead witnessed Atkinson kickstarting a new chapter in breathtaking fashion.\n\nIn a true torch-passing moment, the Surrey paceman assumed centre stage as he toppled the tourists for 121.\n\nAnderson belatedly got in on the act, dismissing number 11 Jayden Seales to end the innings and give a sellout crowd the moment they came for, but Atkinson well and truly stole the show.\n\nEngland had assumed complete control by the close, moving into a 68-run lead as half-centuries from Zak Crawley (76) and Ollie Pope (57) left them 189 for three.\n\nBut the heavy lifting was done by Atkinson, who returned career-best first-class figures as he became the fifth bowler to claim a five-for on debut under Ben Stokes' captaincy.\n\nHe opened his account with his second delivery as a Test cricketer, added another before he had even conceded a run and then took three wickets in four balls during the afternoon session.\n\nHe was on course for the best figures by an English bowler on Test debut, denied only by a late boundary that left Dominic Cork's haul of seven for 43 in 1995 intact.\n\nWhile Anderson was upstaged at his own farewell event, he may have enjoyed a moment of nostalgia recalling his own debut five-for at the same ground back in 2003.\n\nThe country's record wicket-taker was everywhere at the start of play - staring out from the front of the matchday programme, featuring in a series of loving television montages and splashed in silhouette across a commemorative hoodie on sale at \u00a360 in the club shop.\n\nHis daughters Ruby and Lola even had the honour of ringing the five-minute bell at the start of the day.\n\nStokes gave fans what they wanted when he won the toss and opted to bowl first under cloudy skies, but all that was missing was an early breakthrough for the man of the moment.\n\nHis second ball was little more than a loosener but Windies captain Kraigg Brathwaite waved a crooked bat outside off stump and dragged down his own stumps.\n\nAtkinson soon touched 90mph on the speed gun and then picked up a more classical wicket, suckering Kirk McKenzie into a drive and seeing a thick edge sail through to slip.\n\nBy the end of his first spell he boasted pristine figures of 5-3-2-2.\n\nWest Indies struggled to 61 for three at lunch, Stokes accounting for debutant opener Mikyle Louis for 27 thanks to a brilliant one-handed slip catch from Harry Brook.\n\nThe skipper's reaction - open-mouthed and eyes bulging in shock - was reminiscent of Stuart Broad's meme-worthy response to an even more memorable Stokes catch in the 2015 Ashes.\n\nAtkinson returned to cause havoc after the interval, finding himself on a hat-trick in his ninth over as he pounded out an attacking channel and had Alick Athanaze and Jason Holder caught in the cordon.\n\nJosh Da Silva kept out a decent hat-trick delivery but succumbed to the next one, pushing forward and feathering through to give England's new wicketkeeper Jamie Smith his first catch and Atkinson a place on the honours board.\n\nA brilliant reaction catch from Pope did for Kavem Hodge - taking the score from 88 for three to 88 for seven in the space of eight balls.\n\nThe crowd sang his name as one but it was Atkinson who led the team from the field.\n\nSeales returned fire when he had Ben Duckett caught behind for three but England stamped their authority with a stand of 94 between Crawley and Pope.\n\nBoth men survived big lbw appeals from Holder on their way to fifty, sharing 19 boundaries as they went.\n\nHolder finally got a decision to go his way when he pinned Pope in front of leg stump and Seales yorked Crawley as he began to eye a century, leaving Joe Root and Brook in place at the close.", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guernsey Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Anderson had to wait till the second session on Day 1 to open his account with the ball in his final Test match.\n\nThe 41-year-old trapped Seales lbw in the 42nd over of West Indies' first innings in the Test match. Anderson bowled an in-swinger which beat Seales' inside edge and hit his pad on the back foot. The West Indies pacer opted for a review but the decision went in England's favour as Anderson bagged his first wicket in the game.\n\nIt was also incidentally the last wicket of West Indies' innings as the hosts were bundled out for a low-key total of 121 runs at Lord's. With Seales' dismissal, Anderson extended his tally to 701 wickets. He is now just seven short of overtaking the legendary Shane Warne as the second-highest wicket-taker of all time in Test cricket.\n\nAnderson bowled a total of 10.4 overs on Day 1 and finished with a solitary wicket while conceding 26 runs. Fast bowler Gus Atkinson impressed on his England debut as he ran through the West Indies batting line-up with a stunning seven-wicket haul.\n\nAtkinson opened his account with the wicket of West Indies skipper Kraigg Brathwaite in the 11th over before dismissing the likes of Kirk McKenzie, Alick Athanaze, Jason Holder and Joshua Da Silva among others. The debutant finished with brilliant figures of 7/45 off his 12 overs, helping England skittle out West Indies cheaply.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abhishek_kumar@news9live.com", "name": "Abhishek Kumar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Indies"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Anderson_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "James Anderson (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lord's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Seales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Seales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_before_wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leg before wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Da_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joshua Da Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Warne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shane Warne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraigg_Brathwaite", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kraigg Brathwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Holder", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Holder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alick_Athanaze", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alick Athanaze"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/James-Anderson-701-wicket.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721772", "eventUri": "eng-9721772", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 203, "textEnd": 210}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Julien BriseBois signed Cam Atkinson to a one-year deal to mitigate the depth scoring. He will undoubtedly contribute offensively under Jon Cooper this season. With that said, where does he slide in the lineup?\n\nAt 35, many believe his best days are behind him due to a riddling injury history. However, after analyzing through a deeper analytical lens, Atkinson is the perfect fit for a third-line right-wing role this season. Furthermore, he can make this contract a bargain for BriseBois and the Lightning.\n\nDrafted by the Columbus Blue Jackets back in 2008, Atkinson was a steal at the 157th overall pick. The Connecticut native would spend a decade in Columbus, even reaching the NHL All-Star Game in 2019. Then, he joined the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for the perennial passer Jakub Voracek. He spent three seasons in Philadelphia but missed the entire 2022-23 season with a neck injury.\n\nAtkinson luckily came back for the 2023-24 season with the Flyers but lost a step in his game. After a rough season, Philadelphia bought out of the final year of his seven-year, $41.3 million contract. He hit the free agent market as an unrestricted free agent, landing in Tampa Bay on a one-year deal with a cap hit of $900,000. While Atkinson won't score 40 goals like he did twice in his career, he will round out the bottom six and be an impactful player this season.\n\nThe Lightning added a high-volume shooter in Atkinson this summer. Moreover, he ranked tied for 97th in shots amongst forwards in 2023-24. The 35-year-old finds soft areas in the offensive zone for high-danger shot attempts. The once-speedy forward is excellent at creating space for himself in a scoring position. Plus, Atkinson can distribute the puck if the right shot isn't available. Corey Sznajder from AllThreeZones ranked Atkinson in the 94th percentile of chance assists per 60 last season.\n\nWhether generating off the cycle or the rush, the veteran winger will find success. While Atkinson isn't the primary puck carrier when entering the zone, his rush opportunities result in passing plays and scoring chances. Meghan Chayka at Stathletes found that rush opportunities following an offensive-zone pass are more than two times more likely to result in a goal and five times more likely to face a non-set goaltender. His dual-threat play style makes him the perfect third-line right wing this season with two specific linemates.\n\nAtkinson can do it all offensively, which makes him the ideal linemate for Nick Paul and Michael Eyssimont this season. Paul provides defensive support along with size and a goal-scoring touch. The 29-year-old posted a career-high 24 goals last season in 82 games played. He prefers to dump the puck and retrieve on the forecheck but can also get involved in the rush if needed.\n\nOn the left side, Eyssimont is an up-and-coming workhorse. However, he needs some fine-tuning to his game. Eyssimont is a zone entry machine -- the young, speedy forward drives wide and aimlessly shovels pucks on the net from low-danger areas. In addition, his passing game needs to improve significantly. With Atkinson on his line, Eyssimont can set up passing plays to execute high-percentage plays on his zone entries.\n\nWhile the microstats and shot volume metrics signal hope, defensive woes and injuries highlight concerns with signing Atkinson. However, the contract is anything but detrimental to the Lightning organization this season. Under one of the best head coaches in the NHL, expect him to have a solid season in Tampa Bay. Anywhere in the 30-40 point range is reasonable for the 35-year-old in the final stages of his professional hockey career. Ultimately, no one should complain about this low-risk, high-reward signing.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Atkinson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cam Atkinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NHL All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julien_BriseBois", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julien BriseBois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakub_Vor\u00e1\u010dek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jakub Vor\u00e1\u010dek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Cooper_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jon Cooper (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Flyers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Flyers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Blue_Jackets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbus Blue Jackets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Kucherov", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikita Kucherov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikey_Eyssimont", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikey Eyssimont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Cam-Atkinson-Flyers-3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721772", "eventUri": "eng-9721772", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

James Anderson claimed his 701 Test scalp as the West Indies were bowled out for 121, and although it is too early to say the side has found the seamer's replacement, the Surrey fast bowler has laid down a marker.\n\nOnly one Englishman has finished with better figures on debut. It was Dominic Cork, also against the West Indies at Lord's back in 1995, and Atkinson's seven for 45 puts him 11 on the list for best figures on Test debut.\n\nHaving never played a first-class match at Lord's beforehand, Atkinson looked almost instantly at home, claiming the wicket of Kraigg Brathwaite, who played onto his own stumps with only his second ball in the format. The breakthrough came after 10 wicketless overs from the experienced Anderson and Chris Woakes at the start of the day after England won the toss and elected to bowl.\n\nIt is too early to predict Atkinson's future, but Anderson claimed five wickets on Test debut at Lord's, against Zimbabwe 21 years previously. Although there are few similarities between the two in terms of style, Anderson is a swing bowler, while Atkinson is more front-on and often favours the cross-seam delivery, bowling wicket to wicket, few make such an impression on their debut.\n\nAnderson took the final wicket of the innings as the West Indies were bowled out for a disappointing 121 inside the first two sessions of play.\n\nThe entire day was set to pay tribute to Anderson after 22 years of international cricket for England. His family rang the bell five minutes before play, and Lord's had a number of montages prepared for the big screen to showcase his achievements over more than two decades.\n\nAnderson did get in on the act, and the crowd responded, but it was a reminder that the occasion is not about one person, and instead, as England look to the future, they could have a new player to celebrate.\n\nBen Stokes and Brendon McCullum have not been unafraid to throw the ball to inexperienced players, and have often reaped the reward. Will Jacks took a five-for on debut during the first overseas tour of the Bazball era against Pakistan in Rawalpindi, and Rehan Ahmed did the same on his maiden appearance in the third Test of that series in Karachi.\n\nJosh Tonge took five wickets in a standalone Test match before the Ashes in the summer of 2023, and Tom Hartley took seven on his debut at Hyderabad. Atkinson is the latest to repay the England leadership for his faith in the next generation.\n\nWhen it came their turn to bat, England started in an uncharacteristically subdued fashion, but a 94-run partnership between Ollie Pope and Zak Crawley was put on in more typical Bazball fashion.\n\nPope made a useful 57 from 74 before he was trapped lbw by Jason Holder, who had had two lbw decisions overturned by DRS on review previously.\n\nCrawley made 76 before being bowled by Jayden Seales, and at the close of play, England were ____ runs ahead and ___ wickets down.", "source": {"uri":

Zak Crawley and Ollie Pope both scored half-centuries in the afternoon as the home side eased to 189 for three at stumps to take control of the first Test of the summer.\n\n\"I don't think it's sunk in yet. I was looking up at the board seeing my figures and just thinking, 'Wow.' A very special day,\" Atkinson said. \"I was a bit nervous this morning. I woke up and all I could think about was the day ahead. I was a bit emotional this morning and then having my family there for my cap presentation - if you could have asked me what I wanted from my day that was pretty close to the top. It was pretty cool. Just to take a five-for is amazing, more than I could have dreamed of.\n\n\"I was trying to keep as level as possible. My dad was saying, 'It's the biggest day of your life.' And I was saying, 'Relax!' I was a bit nervous to start with but once the first few overs were bowled I was pretty calm.\"\n\nNot only was it Atkinson's Test debut, it was his first red-ball game at Lord's. But after being introduced into the attack with West Indies 34 without loss he had bowled three overs and taken two wickets before he conceded his first run, and later produced a triple-wicket maiden as the tourists slumped from three down to seven without shifting their score from 88. Jimmy Anderson, the focus of pre-match attention on his final England appearance, took one wicket, as did Chris Woakes and Ben Stokes.\n\nAtkinson ended with seven for 45, the second best figures for a debutant in England's men's team (after Dominic Cork, who also took seven wickets but conceded two runs fewer, also against West Indies and also at Lord's, in June 1995). \"I've played a few white-ball games here. I've always felt like I would bowl quite well here with a red ball,\" he said.\n\nJimmy Adams, West Indies' assistant coach, blamed his side's poor performance on a combination of England's excellence with the ball and their own inexperience. \"England exploited conditions really well - they were consistent, they got the ball to swing, they didn't give us any freebies, and maybe there was a little bit of inexperience on our part as well,\" Adams said.\n\n\"I think all of England's bowlers are world class. We hadn't seen Gus bowl but he's done pretty well in county cricket this season and he really put his hand up, and had a dream debut.\"\n\nOnly three members of West Indies' team had played a Test match in England before, and their unfamiliarity with local conditions perhaps contributed to their poor showing with the bat.\n\n\"For young men who've never toured England or batted in conditions like this, it was a real searching examination, but for a young lineup I'd rather they learned these lessons early in their careers,\" Adams said. \"I think it'll make them better players going forward.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_burnton@theguardian.com", "name": "Simon Burnton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Indies"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lord's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_Atkinson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gus Atkinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Crawley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zak Crawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Century (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Woakes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Woakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First-class cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Anderson_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Anderson (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Cork", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Cork"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stokes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stokes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Limited overs cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2580d485900a07bf80d203dde0c1a3fd9d4fb9c7/0_105_3639_2183/master/3639.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=bf50ca008a77a6c560e53e6827fef758", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721772", "eventUri": "eng-9721772", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1995-06-", "textStart": 1967, "textEnd": 1976}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The Surrey quickly dismantled the West Indies batting lineup, finishing with outstanding figures of 7/45 in just 12 overs. His spell included a remarkable feat of taking three wickets in a single over, demonstrating both pace and precision on his Test debut.\n\nThe opening Test at the iconic Lord's witnessed a dramatic shift in momentum. West Indies, led by Kraigg Brathwaite and debutant Mikyle Louis, made a promising start before Atkinson intervened with crucial breakthroughs. England tightened their grip with disciplined fielding, restricting West Indies to 61/3 by lunch, thereby reclaiming control of the game after a slow start.\n\nThe second session belonged entirely to Atkinson, who continued to dominate with his exceptional bowling prowess. His seven-wicket haul on debut dismantled the West Indies batting lineup, exposing their vulnerabilities. Atkinson's ability to swing the ball effectively troubled the West Indies middle order, with Alick Athanaze, Jason Holder and Joshua da Silva among his victims after lunch. Chris Woakes complemented Atkinson's brilliance with a crucial wicket, contributing to West Indies' collapse for a mere 121 runs.\n\nAtkinson's remarkable debut performance also etched his name in history, securing the third-best figures for an English pacer on debut. His achievement surpasses former international John Lever's record, highlighting Atkinson's immediate impact at the highest level of cricket. The best-ever debut figures by an English bowler remain John Ferris's 7 wickets for 37 runs against South Africa in 1892, underscoring Atkinson's place among England's elite debutants.\n\nEngland began their innings cautiously, losing Ben Duckett early but regaining composure through Zak Crawley and Ollie Pope's resilient partnership. Both batters notched up fifties, with a 94-run stand for the second wicket steering England towards a commanding position. Despite interruptions due to bad light, Joe Root and Harry Brook continued to consolidate England's dominance, aiming to extend their first-innings lead. As play halted for the day, England held a substantial lead of 68 runs with Root and Brook poised to capitalize further on Day 2.", "source": {"uri": "crickettimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketTimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Indies"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lord's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_cricket_team_in_the_West_Indies_in_2020\u201321", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lankan cricket team in the West Indies in 2020\u201321"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey_County_Cricket_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey County Cricket Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Ferris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Atkinson, who was received his maiden Test cap, floored the West Indies with a seven-wicket haul. He finished with 7/45 as the Windies perished for a paltry 121 (21.4 overs). Notably, Atkinson recorded the third-best innings figures on Test debut for England.\n\nFormer left-arm seamer John Ferris played Test cricket for Australia and England in a career that had just nine Tests. He played eight Tests for the Aussies before appearing for England in one final Test, against South Africa, in 1882. Ferris bagged figures 6/54 and 7/37 in two innings as the Proteas lost by an innings and 189 runs.\n\nLike Atkinson, former bowler Dominic Cork took a seven-fer against West Indies at Lord's in 1995. Cork took 7/43 in the second innings as the Windies were bundled out for 223 while chasing 296. Notably, the right-arm seamer recorded figures of 1/72 in the first inningss that saw the visitors score 324.\n\nAs mentioned, Atkinson now has the third-best innings figures on Test debut for England. Kraigg Brathwaite, Kirk McKenzie, Alick Athanaze, Jason Holder, Joshua Da Silva, and Alzarri Joseph, and Shamar Joseph were his victims.\n\nJohn Lever has the best innings figures by a Test debutant for England in Asia.

With some strong batting from Zak Crawley with his 76 off 89 balls knock, Stokes's Three Lions ended on 189/3 at stumps on Day 1.\n\nENG vs WI, 1st Test, Day 1: Highlights\n\n26-year-old Atkisnon started off the 1st Test against West Indies in fiery form with the ball, and gave his side a thumping start by dismissing the opposition captain Kriagg Brathwaite early into the innings. West Indies were not able to create any impactful stability at the crease, with their best batting figures coming from Mikey Louis in his 27 off 58 balls knock.\n\nAtkinson bagged the crucial wickets of the likes of Kirk McKenzie, Alick Athanaze and even Jason Holden, to muffle any hopes of a big total for West Indies. On the other hand, the farewell hero James Anderson had to be happy with his sole wicket in his 26/1 spell, and the fact that he was the man who brought an end to West Indies' innings with the bat.\n\nHaving been one of the more consistent Test batters for England over their last few matches, Zak Crawley yet again showcased the reason why he is one of the most dependable batting options for the Three Lions. Where West Indies batters faltered to show calmness and composure on the crease in their turn with the bat, Crawley showed exactly how to do it best.\n\nEngland were hit with a big blow right at the beginning of their innings with the bat when opener Ben Duckett departed in the 8th over of the game after managing only 3 runs off 13 balls. Crawley then took over charge of the runflow, and quite responsibly so. Controlled batting with the occasional boundary, Crawley and Ollie Pope's 94-run partnership ensured that the Three Lions could have ample breathing room for the rest of their innings.\n\nHowever, Pope's dismissal to Jason Holder after scoring 57 off 74, followed by Crawley's wicket to Jayden Seales, the fresh onus for a more promising lead will fall on Harry Brook and Joe Root on Day 2.

Mikyle Louis, the first man from his island of St Kitts to play test cricket for the West Indies, was his side's top scorer with 27 in only his eighth first-class appearance.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Indies"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_Atkinson", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gus Atkinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lord's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Duckett", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ben Duckett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Anderson_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Anderson (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Seales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Seales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Crawley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zak Crawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caught"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Cork", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Cork"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Warne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shane Warne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muttiah_Muralitharan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muttiah Muralitharan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First-class cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/08_07_2024_22_46_09_22677.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721772", "eventUri": "eng-9721772", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Elite catching and banishing sloppiness in the field", "body": "\"As good a display of catching from England as I can remember,\" was the verdict of the great captain Michael Vaughan.\n\nEngland were only in the field for 41.4 overs in bowling out the West Indies for 121, but they were unusually clinical and tidy in every aspect of their work. For two years under Ben Stokes, they have been a consistently entertaining and unpredictable team, but they have not always been accurate.\n\nThink back to last summer's Ashes, when Stuart Broad took a wicket with a no-ball in the first Test, a series of key drops dogged them throughout the summer, and they frittered away reviews with emotional abandon. They have had the feel of a team who need to create 11 chances to take 10 wickets. Not so here.\n\nA good fielding performance invariably begins with the wicketkeeper, and this was no different. Jamie Smith, on debut, made no mistakes.\n\nSmith was always going to be closely watched, because of the excellence of the man he was replacing. No one, not even Smith's biggest fan, would claim he is a better keeper than Ben Foakes. But Smith remains a very able keeper, even if he does not do the job for Surrey, the county he shares with Foakes. He has been selected because he is a better all-round batsman than Foakes, but he is a very solid wicketkeeper, despite his broad-shouldered, 6ft 2in frame.\n\nThose who are working with Smith for the first time this week have been struck by his quiet confidence. The word that keeps coming up is unflustered. He has been so unflustered by the hullabaloo of a Test debut that he opted not to train on the eve of the match. He is low maintenance, and knows that an uncluttered mind is vital on the biggest stage.\n\nSmith has played just two first-class matches at Lord's, and kept in neither of them. The slope can make Lord's an awkward place for inexperienced wicketkeepers, but he did not show it. Shoaib Bashir went unused, so Smith only kept to seamers, but there were no byes, no untidiness, and he snaffled the only chance that came in his way. It was a good catch, too, amid a chaotic passage of play, as Gus Atkinson found Joshua da Silva's inside edge and the ball flew fast to Smith's left.\n\nIf Smith's quiet excellence set the tone, it was catches by Harry Brook and Ollie Pope that lit up the day.\n\nMikyle Louis, the first man from St Kitts to play Test cricket for the West Indies (Joey Benjamin was born there and played for England), had been immovable early on, but a thick edge flew low to Brook's right at third slip, and he took a brilliant diving catch. The bowler was Stokes, who would have been proud of that catch himself. Brook is leaner since the two-month break from the game around the death of his grandmother and at the T20 World Cup he looked a fielder transformed. This was more of the same.\n\nBrook was part of a slip cordon that looked at ease. There were also solid takes from Joe Root and Zak Crawley, and another from Brook, all off the excellent Atkinson.\n\nThe other outstanding catch came from Pope, fielding an unusual position at a short point. Chris Woakes bowled short and wide of Kavem Hodge, who climbed into his cut shot. Almost everyone at Lord's expected the ball to fly to the fence, but Pope plucked it from the air to give Woakes his 150th Test wicket.\n\nWhen Stokes took the wicket of Louis, by the way, he was early in an eight-over spell to lunch that added to the sense that England look well-drilled, fit and organised. There were none of the no-balls that have often shown his ring-rust, or wild deliveries begging to be hit for four.\n\nStokes was clinical and organised as captain, but did provide England's one little error in the field. Atkinson had started with three maidens, when Alick Athanaze cut towards Stokes at point. He misfielded, allowing Athanaze to scamper two, the only runs taken from Atkinson's opening spell. If that is a team's only error, a coach would be hard-pushed to complain. England's team looks younger and refreshed; they have set their standards in the field.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri":

I was emotional,\" he said.\n\n\"I tried to keep as level as possible but my Dad was saying 'this is the biggest day of your life'. I just said 'relax! I'm trying not to think like that!'.\n\n\"He's a big cricket fan, so to make him proud and make my family proud is very special. Walking through the Long Room at the end and seeing him there was pretty cool. If you could ask me what I want in a day, that would be pretty close to the top.\"\n\nAtkinson's analysis was a whisker away from being the best ever by an England debutant, finishing just two runs more expensive than Dominic Cork's record from 1995.\n\nHe was also the fifth first-timer to take a five-for in Ben Stokes' two-year reign as captain.\n\n\"I'm very proud but I don't think it's really sunk in yet to be honest. I was just looking up at the honours board looking at my figures thinking 'wow'. It was a very special day,\" he said.\n\n\"All the focus was on Jimmy so it was quite nice to go under the radar a little bit and focus on performing as well as I could. To be out there alongside Jimmy in his final test was incredible, being there with Jimmy leading us on the pitch was a pretty surreal moment.\n\n\"Ben just said to me 'go out and do your thing' and that was it. If you speak to someone too much a bit of pressure can start to kick in.\"", "source": {"uri": "cricket365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cricket365.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lord's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_Atkinson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gus Atkinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Crawley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zak Crawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Century (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Anderson_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Anderson (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraigg_Brathwaite", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kraigg Brathwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Cork", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Cork"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stokes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stokes"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2gjl3w70qc898.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F07%2F10203012%2F2.76808727.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721772", "eventUri": "eng-9721772", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

after debutant Atkinson tears through Windies batters", "body": "Earlier, England fast bowler Atkinson took seven wickets for 45 runs while James Anderson, playing in his 188th and final test before retirement, claimed his 701st wicket as the hosts dismissed the West Indies in just under 42 overs.\n\nAtkinson took three wickets in four balls at one point, just missing out on a hat-trick, and recorded the best figures by an Englishman on debut since Dominic Cork's seven for 43, also against the West Indies, in 1995.\n\nAnderson meanwhile is third on the all-time test wicket-takers list and needs seven more to join Australian Shane Warne (708) in second place behind Sri Lanka's Muttiah Muralitharan (800).\n\nMikyle Louis, the first man from the island of St Kitts to play test cricket for the West Indies, was his side's top scorer with 27 in an otherwise forgettable innings for the tourists.\n\nAtkinson claimed the wicket of the visitors' captain Kraigg Brathwaite (6) with his second ball and dismissed left-hander Kirk McKenzie for one soon after.\n\nLouis then became Ben Stokes' 199th test wicket, putting the England skipper one short of an all-rounder's double of 200 wickets and 6,000 test runs, a feat only before achieved by West Indian Garry Sobers and South Africa's Jacques Kallis.\n\nWith successive balls Atkinson removed Alick Athanaze for 23 and Jason Holder, back in the touring side's squad after nearly a year away, for a golden duck.\n\nTwo balls later, Atkinson had Joshua da Silva caught behind by wicketkeeper Jamie Smith for a duck, leaving the West Indies in deep trouble on 88 for six.\n\nChris Woakes took his 150th test wicket when he removed Kavem Hodge for 24, and Atkinson dismissed Alzarri Joseph (17) and Shamar Joseph for another duck before Anderson brought the West Indies innings to a close with the wicket of Jayden Seales on two.\n\nIn reply, England lost Ben Duckett (3) early to the bowling of Seales before Pope and Crawley began hitting 11 and 14 fours respectively that took England past the Windies total.\n\nPope was eventually trapped leg before wicket by Holder, and four overs later Seales ripped Crawley's stumps out of the ground with a perfect yorker, bringing Brook to the wicket to join Root.\n\n(Reporting by Hugh Lawson, editing by Ed Osmond and Toby Davis)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title":

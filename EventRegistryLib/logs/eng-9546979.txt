What happens now?", "body": "In the 2016 presidential election, pollsters infamously predicted that Hillary Clinton would win the White House. Here's what we know now about election polling in 2024.\n\nOhio lawmakers on Wednesday failed to advance a plan to put President Joe Biden on the November ballot, a development that underscored bitter divisions among Republicans who control the Legislature.\n\nThe House and Senate floated separate proposals this week that would change the certification deadline to 74 days before the Nov. 5 election. Under current law, state officials must certify the ballot by Aug. 7 - 90 days beforehand - but Biden won't be nominated until the Democratic National Convention 12 days later.\n\nWednesday ended with no plan to get the president and presumptive Democratic nominee on Ohio's ballot. And the clock is running out: Secretary of State Frank LaRose said lawmakers had until Thursday to change the deadline. Bills typically take 90 days to become law unless they have an emergency clause attached to them.\n\nGov. Mike DeWine said Biden will still make the ballot, whether he gets there through the Legislature or courts.\n\n\"I don't want to minimize that this has to happen, but I do want to minimize anybody thinking that there's a snowball's chance in hell that this isn't going to happen,\" DeWine said Wednesday. \"The president's name is going to be on the ballot.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, said the prospects of a legislative solution now look dim, but she emphasized that Democrats have other options - including a lawsuit.\n\n\"We see once again that politicians and the politics and playing games with this piece of legislation ruled the day,\" Russo said. \"I think we've officially sunk lower than Alabama at this point.\"\n\nOhio Senate diverges from bipartisan House plan\n\nHouse leaders introduced a bipartisan proposal on Tuesday to put Biden on the ballot and prevent future scheduling conflicts. For 2028 and beyond, parties that couldn't meet the 90-day deadline would be allowed to certify candidates either 74 days before the election or within three days of their convention, whichever comes first.\n\nBut Senate Republicans pursued a different path, one that Democrats cast as a poison pill and refused to support. They folded a one-time deadline fix into a bill that would ban foreign citizens and U.S. residents with green cards from donating to ballot campaigns. It's already illegal for non-U.S. citizens to give money to candidates.\n\n\"We use the word compromise a lot,\" Senate President Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said. \"I think this is a reasonable result. There's some things for both sides to like and dislike. It gets these two issues resolved for the upcoming election.\"\n\nDemocrats contend that legislation, initially passed by the Senate in February, would create hurdles for groups that want to place issues on the ballot. For instance, it would require ballot campaigns to register as political action committees, something critics say could burden hyperlocal efforts like liquor options.\n\nRepublicans proposed the measure after a progressive dark money group poured millions into campaigns for the abortion rights amendment last year and this year's proposed constitutional amendment to form an independent redistricting commission.\n\n\"There wasn't something for us to love and hate,\" Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood, said. \"It wasn't a compromise. It was frankly a dirty trick and we didn't take the bait.\"\n\nBiden ballot fix underscores Republican divide\n\nThe Senate approved its bill before House lawmakers convened Wednesday afternoon, which left them with two options: Approve their proposal - which was already on the agenda - or agree with the Senate plan. They did neither.\n\nEven before the Senate vote, Republicans pushed back against the House bill because it didn't give them any political wins for helping Democrats. Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, said House Republicans were prepared to agree with the Senate bill and accused Speaker Jason Stephens, R-Kitts Hill, of pulling the rug out from underneath them.\n\nStephens said the support wasn't there.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, LaRose called on the House to hold an emergency vote -- and to do it quickly.\n\n\"The facts are still very clear on this,\" LaRose said. \"The Democrats scheduled their nominating convention too late to comply with Ohio law, and they've admitted that this unforced error creates a problem for their presidential candidate that needs to be fixed.\"\n\nUSA TODAY Network Ohio Bureau reporters Erin Glynn and Jessie Balmert contributed.", "source": {"uri": "eu.dispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Columbus Dispatch"},

A bill in each chamber of the legislature included a resolution to that issue, but neither of them made it through on Wednesday.\n\nAn elections bill from last year that was amended in a House committee Tuesday included with a provision that would ensure Biden is on the ballot this fall. The House didn't take up that bill. And it also didn't vote on a bill that passed the Senate Wednesday that included what Democrats call a \"poison pill\" - a campaign finance measure that they said would make it harder for citizens and groups to bring ballot issues to voters.\n\nThe Biden ballot issue has been discussed since Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose notified Democrats on April 5 that state law requires candidates to be certified for the ballot 90 days before an election, which would be Aug. 7. The Democratic National Convention meets 12 days after that deadline. LaRose's letter also told Democrats the legislature needed to make a change or the convention needed to be moved by May 9.\n\nIn what may seem to be a contradictory vote, Senate Democrats opposed the bill to change the deadline to put Biden on the ballot.\n\nSupermajority Republicans in the Senate approved House Bill 114, which started out as a Democrat-backed bill to allow candidates to use campaign funds to pay for child care. The ballot deadline change was added, along with a proposal to ban foreign contributions to ballot issue campaigns. Republicans have raised concerns about money from a Swiss billionaire in last year's two statewide ballot issues, an August one to require 60% voter approval for constitutional amendments and a November one to guarantee abortion and reproductive rights. The August issue backed by Republicans failed; the one the GOP opposed in November passed.Senate President Matt Huffman (R-Lima) said the bill had to include more than just a fix to put Biden on the ballot \"because Republicans in both the House and the Senate aren't going to vote for a stand-alone Biden bill. There's not enough support for it.\" But Huffman has said he's confident Biden will be on the ballot.Minority Leader Nickie Antonio (D-Lakewood) said all seven Senate Democrats voted against the bill because Republicans added in language she said would make it more difficult for citizen groups to raise funds for ballot initiatives.\"I think it's a 'sore loser bill' because they lost a couple of times at the ballot this past year,\" Antonio said. \"It was, frankly, a dirty trick. And we didn't take the bait.\"Antonio said the ban on foreign nationals' contributions to ballot issue campaigns is unenforceable, and that the law already bans those contributions to candidates.\n\nThe House didn't vote on the Senate's changes to HB 114. Speaker Jason Stephens (R- Kitts Hill) adjourned over objections from members yelling \"114\" in the chamber.\n\n\"We didn't have a consensus over how to get that done between the House and the Senate and all parties involved,\" Stephens said, adding that several members weren't present for a vote.\n\nThe House did informally pass Senate Bill 92, the dormant elections bill from last year with the ballot deadline extension attached. That's a procedural move that allows the bill to brought up for a full vote in the future.\n\nThe House is not set to meet again until May 22. A ballot deadline fix would need to pass through an emergency clause, with votes from two-thirds of the House and Senate. There's no indication that there is enough support for that.\n\n\"There's a lot of different options in order to get him on the ballot,\" Stephens said. \"From a time standpoint, if we can come to an agreement that we can all agree to that we can get an emergency clause on, that's fine. I mean, it's a technical issue so it should be able to be done but if we can't, we can't.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Allison Russo (D-Upper Arlington) didn't mince words in her disgust for the situation.\n\n\"Last week, there was language that Republicans in both chambers agreed to and supported and even had the support of the secretary of state. And we see once again that politicians and the politics and playing games with this piece of legislation ruled the day,\" Russo said.\n\n\"I think we've officially sunk lower than Alabama at this point,\" Russo added, noting that Republican-run state with a similar ballot deadline problem has approved legislation to fix it.\n\nRusso said Biden will be on the ballot in November one way or another. She said there are other options, including the DNC taking action similar to the way it did during the COVID pandemic.\n\n\"You know, we did basically a virtual option in 2020. And yeah, those decisions have not been made, but there are options on the table,\" Russo said.\n\nGov. Mike DeWine would have to sign a legislative fix. He was adamant Biden will be on the Ohio ballot one way or another.\n\n\"I think everyone knows the president's name is going to be on the ballot. There's just there's zero chance that it's not going to happen, and it would be absurd not to have his name on the ballot,\" DeWine said. \"I think in the long run, the legislature needs to take care of this permanently so we don't have this problem again in another presidential election.\"\n\nThe law creating the 90-day deadline passed in 2010, as a timeline selected to accommodate overseas and military ballots in Ohio's 28-day early voting period. But in 2012 and 2020, both major parties' conventions were after that deadline, forcing the legislature to temporarily change it. This is the first time the convention date for only one party is set for after the deadline.\n\nCharles Lutvak, spokesperson for Biden's campaign, issued a written statement, in reaction to the situation.\n\n\"Joe Biden will be on the ballot in all 50 states. Election after election, states across the country have acted in line with the bipartisan consensus and taken the necessary steps to ensure the presidential nominees from both parties will be on the ballot. And this election is no different -- Alabama, with full Republican support, and Washington State are already taking action to ensure that voters can exercise their right to vote for the candidate of

What happens now?", "body": "In the 2016 presidential election, pollsters infamously predicted that Hillary Clinton would win the White House. Here's what we know now about election polling in 2024.\n\nOhio lawmakers on Wednesday failed to advance a plan to put President Joe Biden on the state's November ballot, underscoring bitter divisions among Republicans who control the state Legislature.\n\nThe state House and Senate floated separate proposals this week that would change the certification deadline to 74 days before the Nov. 5 election. Under current law, state officials must certify the ballot by Aug. 7 - 90 days beforehand - but Biden won't be nominated until the Democratic National Convention 12 days later.\n\nWednesday ended with no plan to get the president and presumptive Democratic nominee on Ohio's ballot. And the clock is running out: Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose said lawmakers had until Thursday to change the deadline. Bills typically take 90 days to become law unless they have an emergency clause attached to them.\n\nOhio's Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said Biden will be on the ballot, whether he gets there through the Legislature or courts.\n\n\"I don't want to minimize that this has to happen, but I do want to minimize anybody thinking that there's a snowball's chance in hell that this isn't going to happen,\" DeWine said Wednesday. \"The president's name is going to be on the ballot.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Allison Russo said the prospects of a legislative solution now look dim, but she emphasized that Democrats have other options - including a lawsuit.\n\n\"We see once again that politicians and the politics and playing games with this piece of legislation ruled the day,\" Russo said. \"I think we've officially sunk lower than Alabama at this point.\"\n\nOhio Senate diverges from bipartisan House plan\n\nHouse leaders introduced a bipartisan proposal on Tuesday to put Biden on the ballot and prevent future scheduling conflicts. For 2028 and beyond, parties that couldn't meet the 90-day deadline would be allowed to certify candidates either 74 days before the election or within three days of their convention, whichever comes first.\n\nBut Senate Republicans pursued a different path, one that Democrats cast as a poison pill and refused to support. They folded a one-time deadline fix into a bill that would ban foreign citizens and U.S. residents with green cards from donating to ballot campaigns. It's already illegal for non-U.S. citizens to give money to candidates.\n\n\"We use the word compromise a lot,\" Senate President Matt Huffman said. \"I think this is a reasonable result. There's some things for both sides to like and dislike. It gets these two issues resolved for the upcoming election.\"\n\nDemocrats contend that legislation, initially passed by the Senate in February, would create hurdles for groups that want to place issues on the ballot. For instance, it would require ballot campaigns to register as political action committees, something critics say could burden hyperlocal efforts like liquor options.\n\nRepublicans proposed the measure after a progressive dark money group poured millions into campaigns for Ohio's 2023 abortion rights amendment and independent redistricting commission.\n\n\"There wasn't something for us to love and hate,\" Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio said. \"It wasn't a compromise. It was frankly a dirty trick and we didn't take the bait.\"\n\nBiden ballot fix underscores Republican divide\n\nThe state Senate approved its bill before House lawmakers convened, which left them with two options: Approve their proposal - which was already on the agenda - or agree with the Senate plan. They did neither.\n\nEven before the Senate vote, Republicans pushed back against the House bill because it didn't give them any political wins for helping Democrats. Rep. Brian Stewart said House Republicans were prepared to agree with the Senate bill and accused Speaker Jason Stephens of pulling the rug out from underneath them.\n\nUSA TODAY Network Ohio Bureau

The House version would allow Biden's name to appear on the ballot while also allowing more time and flexibility for political parties to certify presidential nominees in future elections.\n\nAfter the state Senate voted on its measure Wednesday, the Republican-led House adjourned without considering either version.\n\nState Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, warned Democrats last month that Biden was in danger of not qualifying for the state's November ballot because the party's nominating convention is scheduled after the Aug. 7 deadline for certifying candidates.\n\nLaRose has said a legislative fix passed without an emergency clause must be in place by the end of the day Thursday for it to take effect by the deadline. A state House GOP spokesperson declined to say Wednesday whether votes on the legislation were planned before then. A spokesperson for the state House Democratic caucus did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"For weeks now I've said the easiest way to [ensure Biden is on the ballot] is to pass temporary legislation that adjusts the deadline by which they can certify their nominee to my office,\" LaRose said in a statement Wednesday. \"Unfortunately, the Ohio House couldn't get that done today, it appears because Democrats are more interested in protecting foreign billionaires who want to bankroll Ohio's elections than in getting their presidential candidate on the ballot.\n\n\"The House still has time to act with an emergency vote, and it's in the best interest of Ohio voters, as well as our ability to quickly and effectively prepare for a general election, that they find a way to do so,\" he added.\n\nThe stalemate means Democrats might need to go to court to make sure Biden is on the ballot in the purple-turned-red state. Last week, Alabama's GOP-controlled House unanimously passed a bill to resolve a similar issue for Biden, and Republican Gov. Kay Ivey quickly signed it into law.\n\n\"Joe Biden will be on the ballot in all 50 states,\" Biden campaign spokesperson Charles Lutvak said in a statement. \"Election after election, states across the country have acted in line with the bipartisan consensus and taken the necessary steps to ensure the presidential nominees from both parties will be on the ballot.\"\n\nMeeting with reporters Wednesday, Ohio Senate President Matt Huffman suggested that GOP members needed an incentive to help Biden, \"because Republicans in both the House and the Senate aren't going to vote for a stand-alone Biden bill.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of folks in their districts that say, 'I'm going to go run in my district, and the one vote that I took was to put Joe Biden on the ballot,'\" Huffman added. \"Eventually, Joe Biden is going to be on the ballot through whatever means that's going to happen. But I think that it's fair for us to come together and say no foreign money in Ohio elections.\"\n\nOhio law requires presidential and vice presidential nominees to be \"certified to the secretary of state or nominated\" through one of several manners \"on or before the ninetieth day before the day of the general election.\" That makes Aug. 7 -- 12 days before the start of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago -- the deadline this year.\n\nThe issue has come up in previous elections in Ohio and other states, but until now it had typically been resolved without acrimony or fanfare. Democrats and Republicans both had late August conventions in 2012 and 2020.\n\nJustin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who was a senior policy adviser for democracy and voting rights in the Biden White House, said that if the Legislature doesn't resolve the matter, a pricey legal fight almost certainly will.\n\n\"The only question is whether it's fixed cheaply or expensively or in a friendly manner or in a non-friendly manner, but it's going to get fixed,\" Levitt said. \"This is the easiest lawsuit ever if they bring it, because the law actually asks for a reason if you're going to impede somebody's ballot access, and there's no reason why Ohio needs this answer [on who the Democratic presidential nominee is] as early as it does.\n\n\"The fact that we're even here at this point, it's a little bit like a toddler holding its breath,\" Levitt added. \"The outcome is inevitable. It's only a question of how embarrassing it is for the toddler in the meantime.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Here's what we know now about election polling in 2024.\n\nOhio lawmakers on Wednesday failed to advance a plan to put President Joe Biden on the November ballot, a development that underscored bitter divisions among Republicans who control the Legislature.\n\nThe House and Senate floated separate proposals this week that would change the certification deadline to 74 days before the Nov. 5 election. Under current law, state officials must certify the ballot by Aug. 7 - 90 days beforehand - but Biden won't be nominated until the Democratic National Convention 12 days later.\n\nWednesday ended with no plan to get the president and presumptive Democratic nominee on Ohio's ballot. And the clock is running out: Secretary of State Frank LaRose said lawmakers had until Thursday to change the deadline. Bills typically take 90 days to become law unless they have an emergency clause attached to them.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, said the prospects of a legislative solution now look dim, but she emphasized that Democrats have other options - including a lawsuit.\n\n\"We see once again that politicians and the politics and playing games with this piece of legislation ruled the day,\" Russo said. \"I think we've officially sunk lower than Alabama at this point.\"\n\nHouse leaders introduced a bipartisan proposal on Tuesday to put Biden on the ballot and prevent future scheduling conflicts. For 2028 and beyond, parties that couldn't meet the 90-day deadline would be allowed to certify candidates either 74 days before the election or within three days of their convention, whichever comes first.\n\nBut Senate Republicans pursued a different path, one that Democrats cast as a poison pill and refused to support. They folded a one-time deadline fix into a bill that would ban foreign citizens and U.S. residents with green cards from donating to ballot campaigns. It's already illegal for non-U.S. citizens to give money to candidates.\n\n\"We use the word compromise a lot,\" Senate President Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said. \"I think this is a reasonable result. There's some things for both sides to like and dislike. It gets these two issues resolved for the upcoming election.\"\n\nDemocrats contend that legislation, initially passed by the Senate in February, would create hurdles for groups that want to place issues on the ballot. For instance, it would require ballot campaigns to register as political action committees, something critics say could burden hyperlocal efforts like liquor options.\n\nRepublicans proposed the measure after a progressive dark money group poured millions into campaigns for the abortion rights amendment and independent redistricting commission.\n\n\"There wasn't something for us to love and hate,\" Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood, said. \"It wasn't a compromise. It was frankly a dirty trick and we didn't take the bait.\"\n\nThe Senate approved its bill before House lawmakers convened, which left them with two options: Approve their proposal - which was already on the agenda - or agree with the Senate plan. They did neither.\n\nEven before the Senate vote, Republicans pushed back against the House bill because it didn't give them any political wins for helping Democrats. Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, said House Republicans were prepared to agree with the Senate bill and accused Speaker Jason Stephens, R-Kitts Hill, of pulling the rug out from underneath them.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Gov. Mike DeWine said Biden will be on the ballot, whether he gets there through the Legislature or courts.\n\n\"I don't want to minimize that this has to happen, but I do want to minimize anybody thinking that there's a snowball's chance in hell that this isn't going to happen,\" DeWine said. \"The president's name is going to be on the ballot.\"\n\nUSA TODAY Network Ohio Bureau reporters Erin Glynn

Seemingly unbeknownst to the lawmakers, they only gave themselves until Thursday to get this signed into law.\n\nOhio requires parties to confirm their presidential candidates 90 days before the November election, which would be Aug. 7. But Biden won't be the official nominee until the Democratic National Convention, which is on Aug. 19.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, and the Democrats were unaware of this, and plenty of other lawmakers on each side of the aisle also didn't know. Ohio's Secretary of State Frank LaRose didn't remind the Democrats until April.\n\nDemocrats have been reliant on the Republicans to help them.\n\nTo accomplish this, the Republican supermajority, one that is already fractured and has significant infighting that has led to the fewest amount of bills passed in a General Assembly in decades, needs to pass something now -- all to help the Democrats.\n\nThe Ohio Democrats have received support from the House Republicans in getting the president on the ballot.\n\nThe House completely stripped Senate Bill 92, legislation to allow for August special elections -- repealing the 2022 law that banned the vast majority of special elections.\n\nDespite the fact that legal experts said it was likely illegal to have the August election last year because the state law had outlawed them, Ohio still ended up with a special election as the GOP attempted to curb the proposal to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution. Their attempt to stop it failed.\n\nThe nomination deadline fix was put into S.B. 92. Instead of having a 90-day requirement, it would now be 74 days.\n\n\"I think everyone agreed this is good for democracy,\" Russo said. \"We want people to have full access to the ballot, and that's good for both parties.\"\n\nS.B. 92 heads to the House floor on Wednesday after passing out of committee on Tuesday. After it likely passes the House, this means that all it needs to get sent to Gov. Mike DeWine is a concurrence vote from the Senate.\n\n\"We'll see what happens tomorrow on the floor and then also with the Senate,\" Russo said. \"But the conversations have been good so far.\"\n\nIt is unclear how involved the Senate Republicans have been in this process. WEWS/OCJ reached out to the original S.B. 92's sponsor, state Sen. Rob McColley, R-Napoleon, but did not hear back. The spokesperson for the Senate GOP was off on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, Senate President Matt Huffman, R-Lima, agreed in April that his caucus is \"certainly going to try\" to get it resolved.\n\nThus, the House -- which is in a war with the Senate for unrelated reasons -- amended their bill.\n\n\"It enables the notification to be a lot more flexible, whether it's email or whatever,\" House Speaker Jason Stephens, R-Kitts Hill, said. \"This gives the flexibility.\"\n\nThis doesn't just help the Democrats, Stephens added.\n\n\"Just four years ago, we had this issue,\" the speaker said. \"The party in power in the White House usually goes last for the convention, so hopefully this will take care of that issue.\"\n\nThe little-known law was passed in a major omnibus bill in 2010. In 2012 and 2020, exemptions were passed for those years, impacting both parties. In 2016, both the DNC and the RNC held their conventions before the deadline.\n\n\"I think being prescriptive with the day could potentially put us in a position in the future that we have to come back and fix this, but it certainly makes it less likely that we would have to do that,\" Russo said.\n\nHouse leaders are hopeful DeWine will sign the bill on Friday, but also said they have two weeks after that to meet their deadline.\n\n\"Look, President Biden will be on the ballot,\" DeWine told WEWS/OCJ last week. \"This is a quirk in the Ohio law that needs to get fixed -- and it will get fixed one way or the other. I don't think anybody should be concerned about this.\"\n\nBut there is an issue.\n\nThis may get a bit confusing, so here is a full breakdown.\n\nThe deadline to notify Ohio of a party's presidential nominee is Aug. 7.\n\nAfter being signed by the governor and delivered to the secretary of state's office, bills take 90 days to go into effect. Ninety days after May 10 is Aug. 8.\n\nAug. 8 is the day after the nomination deadline.\n\nAfter back-and-forths with each House caucus' administration and checking with two additional legal experts, there is one conclusion: the lawmakers' math was flawed.\n\n\"The only problem that you've encountered, and you were right, is when you start counting,\" Case Western Reserve University constitutional law professor Jonathan Entin said.\n\nThe Democrats acknowledged the error and said they were looking into it. The Republicans had been discussing it with their legal team but said it still doesn't violate state law -- adding that they worked with the secretary of state's team on it. WEWS/OCJ reached out to LaRose's office but didn't hear back.\n\nThe GOP also argued that once the law is effective, \"any previous failure to meet the deadline is immediately cured.\" It was brought up that the nomination deadline is before the law is effective, and it wouldn't impact the deadline that already passed.\n\nThe Democrats recognized that, yes, it is possible they would be breaking the law for a day or more. Both they and the Republicans said it wasn't going to be an issue, though.\n\nThe two solutions found for them:\n\nDeWine's team was asked if they were ready to sign the bill by the end of this week, and they joked that they were going to check their \"ink supply.\"", "source": {"uri": "ohiocapitaljournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ohio Capital Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It's the how and when that remain a mystery.\n\nSenate Republicans wanted to use Biden's predicament as leverage to pass a ban on foreign nationals contributing to ballot campaigns.\n\nThe legislation stemmed from the involvement in a pair of heated ballot campaigns last year of Hansj\u00f6rg Wyss, a Swiss billionaire who has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years into 501(c) nonprofit organizations backing liberal U.S. political causes. A January report issued by LaRose found that over $207 million flowing from Wyss-backed entities went to three groups that, in turn, donated a combined $3.9 million to help pass November's Issue 1, the abortion measure, and to thwart an earlier proposed constitutional amendment that would have made passing it more difficult.\n\nIn order to garner the necessary Republican votes to help Biden out, Republican Senate President Matt Huffman said a compromise was struck to combine the foreign nationals legislation with the language adjusting the ballot deadline. Both proposals were folded into another bill allowing candidates to pay for child care with campaign funds.\n\nAfter fractious debate, the measure cleared the Senate along party lines. Democrats called combining the measures \"a dirty trick\" and \"the worst kind of politics.\"\n\nHuffman said: \"Eventually Joe Biden is going to be on the ballot through whatever means. I think that's fair for us to come together and also say no foreign money in Ohio elections.\"\n\nBut GOP House Speaker Jason Stephens, who depends on the support of minority Democrats to keep his job, had been working on a different solution.\n\nStephens had in mind a \"clean\" bill that called for moving this year's ballot deadline to Aug. 23, the day after Democrats' convention. It also included a long-term solution allowing extensions in future years when either party's nominating convention falls less than 90 days before the election.\n\nThis would be the third time since 2012 that Ohio has had to change its ballot deadline to accommodate conflicts faced by presidential candidates of both parties.\n\nBut that House plan stalled after it was informally passed, and when Stephens declined to call a vote on the Senate's ballot fix, the chamber erupted. Fellow Republicans aligned against Stephens jeered and booed. Some cried, \"Shame!\"\n\nLaRose, who initially identified the calendar glitch, issued a statement condemning the House's inaction. Though the chamber's majority is Republican, he said it appeared that \"Democrats are more interested in protecting foreign billionaires who want to bankroll Ohio's elections than in getting their presidential candidate on the ballot.\"\n\nHe pointed out that the House still has time to act with an emergency vote, which requires a two-thirds majority and allows a bill to become effective immediately.\n\nOn Thursday, LaRose took his criticism further - bringing up Wyss by name.\n\n\"There's one person at this point who's responsible for keeping Joe Biden off the ballot in Ohio, and it's a Swiss billionaire you've probably never heard of,\" he said in a statement. He alleged Democrats have \"become dependent on Wyss's dark money to fund everything from their ballot campaigns to their fake news operations.\"\n\nState Sen. Bill DeMora, a Columbus Democrat, accused LaRose of politicizing his office and said blaming Democrats for the lack of a ballot resolution is \"almost so sad it's funny.\"\n\n\"It is not the Democrats' fault that the Republicans are infighting and can't govern, but the Secretary is just trying to please right-wing extremists instead of doing his job to avoid further embarrassment,\" he said in a statement. \"This debacle falls squarely on the MAGA cult Republican supermajority in both chambers who only hold power because of the unconstitutionally gerrymandered maps that LaRose voted for.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julie_carr_smyth@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Julie Carr Smyth", "type":

The Republican-controlled House and Senate need to find a solution by May 9; otherwise, Biden may not appear on the ballot in November.\n\nUnlike leftist efforts to boot Trump from state ballots nationwide, this issue comes down entirely to the enforcement of a legitimate law on the books.\n\nThis issue revolves around the deadline for political parties to nominate their presidential candidates. Per Ohio law, this deadline falls 90 days ahead of the general election. With this year's Election Day set for November 5, the deadline is August 7 -- nearly two weeks before the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where Biden (likely) will be formally nominated as the Democrats' presidential candidate.\n\nAccording to The Epoch Times, in Ohio's legislative process, bills usually require 90 days from passage and gubernatorial signature to become law, unless they include an emergency clause. This clause is precisely why Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose has pointed to May 9 as the critical date for a legislative fix to occur.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Allison Russo, a Democrat, told reporters that a legislative solution is now unlikely. A lawsuit is possible, she noted.\n\n\"We see once again that politicians and the politics and playing games with this piece of legislation ruled the day,\" Ms. Russo said.\n\nSenate President Matt Huffman, a Republican, said last month that he believes that a federal judge will order President Biden onto the Ohio ballot. He pointed out that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that President Trump would appear on the Colorado and Maine ballots because states can't prevent federal candidates from ballot access.\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, said on May 8 that President Biden will appear on the ballot through legislation or the courts and he wants to \"minimize anybody thinking that there's a snowball's chance in hell that this isn't going to happen.\"\n\nThe Republican-dominated House in Alabama unanimously approved a comparable bill to ensure Biden's presence on the ballot. Governor Kay Ivey, also a Republican, subsequently signed the legislation into law.\n\nCuriously, the problems with passing the law isn't coming from Republicans, who have a supermajority in the state government. It's coming from Democrats.\n\nOn May 8, the Republican-controlled Senate voted on party lines to pass legislation that would amend the certification deadline for President Biden's ballot access while banning foreign contributions to state ballot measure campaigns.\n\nThe latter provision's addition conflicted with the House's bill from earlier this week that did not include that attachment.\n\n\"Democrats are more interested in protecting foreign billionaires who want to bankroll Ohio's election than getting their presidential candidate on the ballot,\" Secretary of State

This year, Election Day is Nov. 5, which makes the deadline Aug. 7.\n\nOnce passed and signed by the governor, Ohio bills typically take 90 days to become law unless they are accompanied by an emergency clause, which is the reason for Mr. LaRose's May 9 date.\n\nPresident Biden is expected to be formally nominated for reelection at the Democratic National Convention, which will be held Aug. 19-22 in Chicago.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Allison Russo, a Democrat, told reporters that a legislative solution is now unlikely. A lawsuit is possible, she noted.\n\n\"We see once again that politicians and the politics and playing games with this piece of legislation ruled the day,\" Ms. Russo said.\n\nSenate President Matt Huffman, a Republican, said last month that he believes that a federal judge will order President Biden onto the Ohio ballot. He pointed out that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that President Trump would appear on the Colorado and Maine ballots because states can't prevent federal candidates from ballot access.\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, said on May 8 that President Biden will appear on the ballot through legislation or the courts and he wants to \"minimize anybody thinking that there's a snowball's chance in hell that this isn't going to happen.\"\n\nAlabama's GOP-controlled House unanimously voted to pass a similar bill to get President Biden on the ballot. Republican Gov. Kay Ivey signed the legislation into law.\n\nOn May 8, the Republican-controlled Senate voted on party lines to pass legislation that would amend the certification deadline for President Biden's ballot access while banning foreign contributions to state ballot measure campaigns.\n\nThe latter provision's addition conflicted with the House's bill from earlier this week that did not include that attachment.\n\nThe House version would add President Biden's name to the general election ballot and permit additional time for political parties to certify nominees in future presidential elections.\n\nMr. LaRose, who ran for Ohio's Republican U.S. Senate nomination but was defeated by Bernie Moreno in March, said in a statement on May 8 that the easiest way to ensure President Biden is on the ballot \"is to pass temporary legislation that adjusts the deadline by which they can certify their nominee to my office.\"\n\nHe added, \"Democrats are more interested in protecting foreign billionaires who want to bankroll Ohio's election than getting their presidential candidate on the ballot.\"\n\nMr. LaRose noted that the House can still act with an emergency vote.\n\nIn April, Mr. LaRose wrote a letter to state Democrat officials warning that President Biden might not qualify for the general election ballot unless Democrats adjusted their convention date or convinced Republicans to change state law by May 9.\n\nAttorney Don McTigue sent a letter to Mr. LaRose's office saying that the Democrat Party would provisionally certify President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris before the Aug. 7 deadline.\n\nPresident Biden has already gained enough delegates to the nomination, Mr. McTigue noted.\n\nOhio Attorney General Dave Yost's office responded that provisional approval is not permitted, and Mr. LaRose cannot change election deadlines.\n\nPresident Biden's campaign has said that their candidate will be on the ballot in all 50 states.\n\nMr. Huffman told reporters on May 8 that Republicans in the House and Senate would not vote for a standalone bill to get President Biden on the ballot.\n\n\"Eventually, Joe Biden is going to be on the ballot through whatever means that's going to happen. But I think that it's fair for us to come together and say, no foreign money in Ohio elections,\" Mr. Huffman said.\n\nPresident Biden faces a significant challenge in Ohio if he does appear on the ballot. President Trump won the state by eight points in 2016 and 2020. In addition to a supermajority in the state legislature, Ohio has a Republican governor (Mr. DeWine), secretary of state (Mr. LaRose), and attorney general (Mr. Yost).\n\nEndorsed by President Trump, Ohioan J.D. Vance was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022.\n\nLongtime Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown is seeking another term and faces Moreno, who is backed by President Donald Trump, in the general election this year.\n\nReagan McCarthy, a spokesperson for Mr. Moreno, told The Epoch Times in an email that the candidate opposes attempts by Democrats to keep President Trump off the ballot and thinks that President Biden should be allowed on the Ohio ballot.\n\n\"He believes that Ohioans should have the right to vote for their preferred candidate for President, and that ultimately, President Trump will win Ohio in another landslide,\" Ms. McCarthy wrote.\n\nAs President Biden continued his ballot access quest in Ohio on May 8, independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced he had collected enough signatures in the state to accomplish that feat.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"},

With this inaction, the state loses the easiest solution to the debacle.\n\nOn an even more chaotic day than usual at the Statehouse, tensions ran high as lawmakers only had today to pass regular legislation to get Biden on the ballot -- thus sending the bill to the governor's desk by Thursday.\n\nOhio Democrats need the Republicans' help -- and they have somewhat got it, but only within their chambers.\n\nOhio requires parties to confirm their presidential candidates 90 days before the Nov. election, which would be Aug. 7. But Biden won't be the official nominee until the Democratic National Convention, which is on Aug. 19.\n\nDemocratic leaders were unaware of this, and plenty of other lawmakers across the aisle also didn't know. Sec. of State Frank LaRose didn't remind Dems until April.\n\nTo get Biden on the ballot, the Republican supermajority, one that is already fractured and has significant infighting that has led to the fewest amount of bills passed in a General Assembly in decades, needed to pass something now -- all to help the Dems.\n\nOhio lawmakers err in attempt to fix Biden ballot problem\n\nRELATED: Ohio lawmakers err in attempt to fix Biden ballot problem\n\nThe problem I found\n\nParties must tell Ohio their presidential nominee before or on Aug. 7.\n\nAfter being signed by the governor and delivered to the secretary of state's office, bills take 90 days to go into effect.\n\nOhio law specifically states in Article II, Section 1c: \"No law passed by the General Assembly shall go into effect until ninety days after it shall have been filed by the governor in the office of the secretary of state.\"\n\nNinety days after May 10 is Aug. 8.\n\nAug. 8 is the day after the nomination deadline.\n\nAfter back-and-forths with each House caucus' administration and checking with two additional legal experts, I have concluded that the lawmakers' math was flawed.\n\nThis means that they needed to concur on a bill today to send to DeWine by Thursday at the very latest; that way, he could sign it the same day. This doesn't typically happen, and the governor usually takes at least several days, but the administration is eager to fix this problem -- and likely would have dealt with it.\n\nYesterday, I asked DeWine's team if they were ready to sign the bill by the end of this week, and they joked that they were going to check their \"ink supply.\"\n\nAfter our story broke, lawmakers told me that they moved into gear now, knowing that Thursday was the deadline.\n\nHowever, that passage deadline has now passed, and there is no bill to show for it.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nOn Tuesday, the House passed their solution out of committee, sending it to the floor.\n\nThey completely stripped Senate Bill 92, legislation to allow for August special elections -- repealing the 2022 law that banned the vast majority of special elections. They did this despite the fact that legal experts said it was likely illegal to have the August election last year because the state law had outlawed them. Ohio still ended up with a special election, though, as the GOP attempted to curb the proposal to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution. Their attempt to stop it failed.\n\nThe main reason why lawmakers often choose to amend bills at the last minute is due to timing. By revising an already passed piece of legislation, one that typically is ready to be passed by the second chamber, the lawmakers fast-track the process of getting it to the governor.\n\nThe nomination deadline fix was put into S.B. 92. Instead of having a 90-day requirement, it would now be 74 days. This would likely be a permanent fix.\n\nIt is unclear how involved the Senate Republicans have been in this process. I reached out to the original S.B. 92's sponsor, state Sen. Rob McColley (R-Napoleon), but did not hear back.\n\nDespite this bill being ready to go and supported by each side of the House's aisle, the Senate ignored their announcement of the bill.\n\nSenate\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the Senate amended House Bill 114, which would have allowed a candidate to use their campaign funds to pay childcare costs while they are campaigning.\n\nThey added in a fix for the presidential nominating deadline from Aug. 7 to August 23 -- but only for 2024, so it wasn't a permanent fix. Still, Democrats were satisfied with this provision.\n\n\"It's a great thing,\" Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio (D-Lakewood) said. \"This affects the Democratic candidate being on the ballot, but in the past, it's affected both candidates -- Republican and Democrat.\"\n\nThe little-known law was passed in a major omnibus bill in 2010. In 2012 and 2020, exemptions were passed for those years -- impacting both parties. In 2016, both the DNC and the RNC held their conventions before the deadline.\n\nHowever, that wasn't the only thing added.\n\nThe lawmakers added in Senate Bill 215, a campaign finance bill. In early March, Republican senators passed legislation meant to stop foreign donations to state ballot-issue campaigns, but Democrats argued the bill goes too far, as it has a provision that could make it harder for grassroots movements to get on the ballot -- even with U.S. dollars.\n\nS.B. 215 would prohibit foreign nationals from contributing to campaigns for or against state or local ballot issues. This could be by directly donating from outside the country or by donating to an entity, like a political action committee (PAC).\n\nOhio Senate passes bill to stop foreign donations on ballot campaigns\n\nRELATED: Ohio Senate passes bill to stop foreign donations on ballot campaigns\n\nThis addition was unacceptable to the Democrats, Antonio said.\n\n\"The language that has been embedded into 114 is yet another attempt to try to silence the voters of Ohio when they disagree with the supermajority of Republicans and go on their own to put together a ballot initiative,\" Antonio said.\n\nAll the Democrats voted no because of S.B. 215. Still, it passed 24-7.\n\n\"Republicans in both the House and the Senate aren't going to vote for a standalone Biden bill,\" Senate President Matt Huffman (R-Lima) said, defending why he put the bills all together.\n\nIt was then sent over to the House.\n\nHouse\n\nHouse session was more disorderly than normal.\n\nThe House \"informally passed\" its version of the Biden fix, S.B. 92. This means it stays on the calendar but doesn't actually pass and isn't put up for a vote. It can be brought up for a vote at a later date.\n\nWhile this was happening -- chaos ensued.\n\nSeveral members stood up to try to call for a motion to vacate, trying to kick House Speaker Jason Stephens (R-Kitts Hill) out of his seat. Nothing came of it.\n\nSession was adjourned before debating H.B. 114, much to Stephens' foes' dismay.\n\nAs the speaker came over to talk to reporters, GOP lawmakers screamed at him that he shouldn't have his seat.\n\nClick here for an in-depth play-by-play and a history of Republican squabbling.\n\nIn brief, this drama stems from January 2023 and how Stephens came to power. The Republican caucus had previously chosen state Rep. Derek Merrin (R-Monclova) as speaker months before the full House floor vote. Twenty-two Republicans (known \"affectionately\" by the other faction as the \"Blue 22\") and 32 Democrats voted for Stephens for speaker during the actual vote, while the majority of Republicans voted for Merrin. Stephens, still a conservative, is significantly more moderate than Merrin -- he is also more moderate than Huffman.\n\nRegardless of the infighting, it was a no-go on the Senate's proposal.\n\n\"We had those conversations and ended up not doing it today,\" Stephens said about not concurring.\n\nThere will be other ways to get Biden on the ballot, he added.\n\n\"I think you guys have probably went through a lot of the different possibilities,\" Stephens said, nonchalantly addressing the questions peppered at him from reporters. \"I'm not concerned about that happening.\"\n\nWhy this may be happening\n\nRepublican infighting has been the theme of the 135th General Assembly.\n\n\"We cannot do the good work for the people -- of passing good public policy -- because there is a proxy war going on for who's going to be the next speaker of the house,\" Antonio said.\n\nAs the days go on, the 64-year-old Huffman and 53-year-old Stephens have been bickering about nearly everything since the fall: marijuana, the budget, education -- but most importantly, speakership.\n\nHuffman finally announced a long-expected move -- his interest in running to unseat Stephens in January 2025. He suggested to me in March that Stephens is not doing a good enough job and said that Democrats have reached out to him about a possible speaker run.\n\nRELATED: Republican squabbling keeps marijuana off shelves months after legalization\n\nThe two GOP leaders are too busy fighting with each other that nothing gets done, Democrats say.\n\n\"We see, once again, that politicians and the politics in playing games with this piece of legislation ruled the day,\" House Minority Leader Allison Russo (D-Upper Arlington). \"I think we've officially sunk lower than Alabama at this point.\"\n\nAlabama, arguably one of the most red states in the country, was able to get Biden on the ballot last week by fixing a similar law.\n\nResults\n\nNothing is getting sent to DeWine, so nothing will be signed by the deadline. However, lawmakers can pass a Biden fix at any time, as long as it has an emergency clause allowing the legislation to go into effect immediately instead of with a 90-day waiting period. However, getting an emergency clause is a tough task for a divided chamber -- it requires a 2/3 majority to pass, instead of a simple majority.\n\nAntonio said she isn't worried, because she thinks the courts will get involved.\n\n\"We don't know until it all plays out,\" Antonio said. \"But Joe Biden will be on the ballot in the state of Ohio, it may not happen with the legislature.\"\n\nCase Western Reserve University law professor Jonathan Entin disagreed that a court would be able to do anything.\n\nCan Ohio overcome dysfunction to fix Biden ballot conflict? It's unclear\n\nRELATED: Can Ohio overcome dysfunction to fix Biden ballot conflict? It's unclear\n\nLaRose issued this statement a few hours after the House adjourned without passing anything.\n\n\"The facts are still very clear on this. The Democrats scheduled their nominating convention too late to comply with Ohio law, and they've admitted that this unforced error creates a problem for their presidential candidate that needs to be fixed. For weeks now I've said the easiest way to do that is to pass temporary legislation that adjusts the deadline by which they can certify their nominee to my office. Unfortunately, the Ohio House couldn't get that done today, it appears because Democrats are more interested in protecting foreign billionaires who want to bankroll Ohio's elections than in getting their presidential candidate on the ballot. The House still has time to act with an emergency vote, and it's in the best interest of Ohio voters, as well as our ability to quickly and effectively prepare for a general election, that they find a way to do so.\"\n\nIt is unclear how the lack of passage of H.B. 114 is the fault of Democrats, the superminority. The Republicans technically have a supermajority and could do it without Democratic votes.", "source": {"uri": "wcpo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WCPO"}, "authors": [{"uri":

State officials must currently certify the ballot 90 days beforehand - which falls on Aug. 7 this year - but Biden won't be nominated until the Democratic National Convention 12 days later.\n\nThe Senate vote came one day after House leaders unveiled a separate plan to fix the problem and prevent it from happening in the future. The House is expected to take up that bill this afternoon.\n\nRepublicans folded the new deadline into a bill that would allow candidates to use their campaign funds to cover child care costs. It also includes a modified plan to ban foreign citizens from donating to ballot campaigns, which the Senate initially passed in February.\n\nAll Democrats in the Senate opposed the bill.\n\n\"This Legislature is not fair,\" Sen.

A January report issued by LaRose found that over $207 million flowing from Wyss-backed entities went to three groups that, in turn, donated a combined $3.9 million to help pass November's Issue 1, the abortion measure, and to thwart an earlier proposed constitutional amendment that would have made passing it more difficult.\n\nIn order to garner the necessary Republican votes to help Biden out, Republican Senate President Matt Huffman said a compromise was struck to combine the foreign nationals legislation with the language adjusting the ballot deadline.

I think that's fair for us to come together and also say no foreign money in Ohio elections.\"\n\nBut GOP House Speaker Jason Stephens, who depends on the support of minority Democrats to keep his job, had been working on a different solution.\n\nStephens had in mind a \"clean\" bill that called for moving this year's ballot deadline to Aug. 23, the day after Democrats' convention. It also included a long-term solution allowing extensions in future years when either party's nominating convention falls less than 90 days before the election.\n\nThis would be the third time since 2012 that Ohio has had to change its ballot deadline to accommodate conflicts faced by presidential candidates of both parties.\n\nBut that House plan stalled after it was informally passed, and when Stephens declined to call a vote on the Senate's ballot fix, the chamber erupted. Fellow Republicans aligned against Stephens jeered and booed. Some cried, \"Shame!\"\n\nLaRose, who initially identified the calendar glitch, issued a statement condemning the House's inaction. Though the chamber's majority is Republican, he said it appeared that \"Democrats are more interested in protecting foreign billionaires who want to bankroll Ohio's elections than in getting their presidential candidate on the ballot.\"\n\nHe pointed out that the House still has time to act with an emergency vote, which requires a two-thirds majority and allows a bill to become effective immediately.\n\nOn Thursday, LaRose took his criticism further -- bringing up Wyss by name.\n\n\"There's one person at this point who's responsible for keeping Joe Biden off the ballot in Ohio, and it's a Swiss billionaire you've probably never heard of,\" he said in a statement. He alleged Democrats have \"become dependent on Wyss's dark money to fund everything from their ballot campaigns to their fake news operations.\"\n\nState Sen. Bill DeMora, a Columbus Democrat, accused LaRose of politicizing his office and said blaming Democrats for the lack of a ballot resolution is \"almost so sad it's funny.\"\n\n\"It is not the Democrats' fault that the Republicans are infighting and can't govern, but the Secretary is just trying to please right-wing extremists instead of doing his job to avoid further embarrassment,\" he said in a statement. \"This debacle falls squarely on the MAGA cult Republican supermajority in both chambers who only hold power because of the unconstitutionally gerrymandered maps that LaRose voted for.\"\n\nWyss was born in Bern, Switzerland in 1935.

This year, Biden is expected to be certified on Aug. 22 at the latest, which is 75 days before the Nov. 5 general election.\n\nThe fix was amended into a previously-passed Senate bill and passed unanimously and hurriedly by a House Government Oversight Committee Tuesday. The timing allows the House to vote on the bill during its session on Wednesday and pass the bill back over to the Senate for a concurrence vote.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, said she's been encouraged by the bipartisan action to rectify the situation but noted that she's not celebrating just yet.\n\n\"Around here, every day, you always expect that anything can happen. So, until it's completely done, you know, we'll keep working and having the conversation,\" Russo said when this news organization asked if she expected any push back.\n\nThe bill will need to pass both the House and the Senate with a simple majority. Leaders for the GOP super majorities in both chambers have been receptive to the fix, but the House has a splintered GOP caucus and a rising animosity between Stephens and a sizable cohort of his peers.\n\nIt's the first publicly proposed solution after over a month of mostly behind-closed-doors deliberations, which was sparked by Secretary of State Frank LaRose's letter informing the Biden campaign and the Ohio Democratic Party that his official nomination would be too late to comply with Ohio law.\n\nOhio has had to make legislative fixes on this issue several times -- including amenable solutions for both parties as recently as 2020 -- but the fixes had been narrow and have thus left the state slightly reeling this time around.\n\nStephens and Russo both said they hoped this year's solution will limit problems in the future.\n\n\"I think everyone agreed that this is good for democracy,\" Russo said. \"We want people to have full access to the ballot, and that's good for both parties.

It also included a long-term solution allowing extensions in future years when either party's nominating convention falls less than 90 days before the election.\n\nThis would be the third time since 2012 that Ohio has had to change its ballot deadline to accommodate conflicts faced by presidential candidates of both parties.\n\nBut that House plan stalled after it was informally passed, and when Stephens declined to call a vote on the Senate's ballot fix, the chamber erupted. Fellow Republicans aligned against Stephens jeered and booed. Some cried, \"Shame!\"\n\nLaRose, who initially identified the calendar glitch, issued a statement condemning the House's inaction. Though the chamber's majority is Republican, he said it appeared that \"Democrats are more interested in protecting foreign billionaires who want to bankroll Ohio's elections than in getting their presidential candidate on the ballot.\"\n\nHe pointed out that the House still has time to act with an emergency vote, which requires a two-thirds majority and allows a bill to become effective immediately.\n\nOn Thursday, LaRose took his criticism further - bringing up Wyss by name.\n\n\"There\u00b4s one person at this point who\u00b4s responsible for keeping Joe Biden off the ballot in Ohio, and it\u00b4s a Swiss billionaire you\u00b4ve probably never heard of,\" he said in a statement. He alleged Democrats have \"become dependent on Wyss\u00b4s dark money to fund everything from their ballot campaigns to their fake news operations.\"\n\nState Sen. Bill DeMora, a Columbus Democrat, accused LaRose of politicizing his office and said blaming Democrats for the lack of a ballot resolution is \"almost so sad it's funny.\"\n\n\"It is not the Democrats\u00b4 fault that the Republicans are infighting and can\u00b4t govern, but the Secretary is just trying to please right-wing extremists instead of doing his job to avoid further embarrassment,\" he said in a statement. \"This debacle falls squarely on the MAGA cult Republican supermajority in both chambers who only hold power because of the unconstitutionally gerrymandered maps that LaRose voted for.\"\n\nWyss was born in Bern, Switzerland in 1935. He now lives in Wyoming.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type":

Seemingly unbeknownst to the lawmakers, they only gave themselves until Thursday to get this signed into law.\n\nOhio requires parties to confirm their presidential candidates 90 days before the Nov. election, which would be Aug. 7. But Biden won't be the official nominee until the Democratic National Convention, which is on Aug. 19.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Allison Russo (D-Upper Arlington) and the Democrats were unaware of this, and plenty of other lawmakers on each side of the aisle also didn't know. Sec. of State Frank LaRose didn't remind the Democrats until April.\n\nThe Democrats have been reliant on the Republicans to help them.\n\nTo accomplish this, the Republican supermajority, one that is already fractured and has significant infighting that has led to the fewest amount of bills passed in a General Assembly in decades, needs to pass something now -- all to help the Democrats.\n\nCan Ohio overcome dysfunction to fix Biden ballot conflict? It's unclear\n\nRELATED: Can Ohio overcome dysfunction to fix Biden ballot conflict? It's unclear\n\nThe Ohio Democrats have received support from the House Republicans in getting the president on the ballot.\n\nThe House completely stripped Senate Bill 92, legislation to allow for August special elections -- repealing the 2022 law that banned the vast majority of special elections. They did this despite the fact that legal experts said it was likely illegal to have the August election last year because the state law had outlawed them. Ohio still ended up with a special election, though, as the GOP attempted to curb the proposal to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution. Their attempt to stop it failed.\n\nThe nomination deadline fix was put into S.B. 92. Instead of having a 90-day requirement, it would now be 74 days.\n\n\"I think everyone agreed this is good for democracy,\" Russo said. \"We want people to have full access to the ballot, and that's good for both parties.\"\n\nS.B. 92 heads to the House floor on Wednesday after passing out of committee on Tuesday. After it likely passes the House, this means that all it needs to get sent to Gov. Mike DeWine is a concurrence vote from the Senate.\n\n\"We'll see what happens tomorrow on the floor and then also with the Senate,\" Russo said. \"But the conversations have been good so far.\"\n\nIt is unclear how involved the Senate Republicans have been in this process. I reached out to the original S.B. 92's sponsor, state Sen. Rob McColley (R-Napoleon), but did not hear back. The spokesperson for the Senate GOP was off work Tuesday.\n\nHowever, Senate President Matt Huffman (R-Lima) agreed in April that his caucus is \"certainly going to try\" to get it resolved.\n\nThus, the House -- which is in a war with the Senate for unrelated reasons -- amended their bill.\n\nRELATED: Republican squabbling keeps marijuana off shelves months after legalization\n\n\"It enables the notification to be a lot more flexible, whether it's email or whatever,\" House Speaker Jason Stephens (R-Kitts Hill) said. \"This gives the flexibility.\"\n\nThis doesn't just help the Democrats, Stephens added.\n\n\"Just four years ago, we had this issue,\" the speaker said. \"The party in power in the White House usually goes last for the convention, so hopefully this will take care of that issue.\"\n\nThe little-known law was passed in a major omnibus bill in 2010. In 2012 and 2020, exemptions were passed for those years -- impacting both parties. In 2016, both the DNC and the RNC held their conventions before the deadline.\n\n\"I think being prescriptive with the day could potentially put us in a position in the future that we have to come back and fix this, but it certainly makes it less likely that we would have to do that,\" Russo said.\n\nHouse leaders are hopeful DeWine will sign the bill on Friday, May 10, but assure they have two weeks after that to meet their deadline.\n\n\"Look, President Biden will be on the ballot,\" DeWine told me last week. \"This is a quirk in the Ohio law that needs to get fixed -- and it will get fixed one way or the other. I don't think anybody should be concerned about this.\"\n\nBut there is an issue.\n\nThe problem\n\nThis may get a bit confusing, so here is a full breakdown.\n\nParties must tell Ohio their presidential nominee before or on Aug. 7.\n\nAfter being signed by the governor and delivered to the secretary of state's office, bills take 90 days to go into effect.\n\nOhio law specifically states in Article II, Section 1c: \"No law passed by the General Assembly shall go into effect until ninety days after it shall have been filed by the governor in the office of the secretary of state.\"\n\nNinety days after May 10 is Aug. 8.\n\nAug. 8 is the day after the nomination deadline.\n\nAfter back-and-forths with each House caucus' administration and checking with two additional legal experts, I have concluded that the lawmakers' math was flawed.\n\n\"The only problem that you've encountered, and you were right, is when you start counting,\" Case Western Reserve University constitutional law professor Jonathan Entin said.\n\nThe Democrats acknowledged the error and said they were looking into it. The Republicans had been discussing it with their legal team but said it still doesn't violate state law -- adding that they worked with the secretary of state's team on it. I reached out to LaRose's office but didn't hear back.\n\nThe GOP also argued that once the law is effective, \"any previous failure to meet the deadline is immediately cured.\" I brought up that the nomination deadline is before the law is effective, and it wouldn't impact the deadline that already passed.\n\nThe Democrats recognized that, yeah, it is possible we would be breaking the law for a day or more. Both they and the Republicans said it wasn't going to be an issue, though.\n\nSolutions\n\nI found two solutions for them.\n\nPass the bill with an emergency clause so it goes into effect immediatelyHave DeWine sign it by Thursday at the latest\n\nI asked DeWine's team if they were ready to sign the bill by the end of this week, and they joked that they were going to check their \"ink

The state House version would allow Biden's name to appear on the ballot while also allowing more time and flexibility for political parties to certify presidential nominees in future elections.\n\nAfter the state Senate voted on its measure Wednesday, the Republican-led state House adjourned without considering either version.\n\nOhio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, warned Democrats last month that Biden was in danger of not qualifying for the state's November ballot because the party's nominating convention is scheduled to occur after the Aug. 7 deadline for certifying candidates.\n\nLaRose has said a legislative fix passed without an emergency clause must be in place by the end of the day Thursday for it to take effect by the deadline. A state House GOP spokesperson declined to say Wednesday if votes on the legislation were planned before then. A spokesperson for the state House Democratic caucus did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe stalemate means that Democrats might need to go to court to make sure Biden is on the ballot in the purple-turned-red state. Last week, Alabama's GOP-controlled state House unanimously passed a bill to resolve a similar issue for Biden in that state, and Republican Gov. Kay Ivey quickly signed the fix into law.\n\n\"Joe Biden will be on the ballot in all 50 states,\" Biden campaign spokesperson Charles Lutvak said in a statement to NBC News. \"Election after election, states across the country have acted in line with the bipartisan consensus and taken the necessary steps to ensure the presidential nominees from both parties will be on the ballot.\"\n\nMeeting with reporters Wednesday, Ohio state Senate President Matt Huffman suggested that GOP members needed an incentive to help Biden, \"because Republicans in both the House and the Senate aren't going to vote for a standalone Biden bill.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of folks in their districts that say, 'I'm going to go run in my district, and the one vote that I took was to put Joe Biden on the ballot,'\" Huffman added. \"Eventually, Joe Biden is going to be on the ballot through whatever means that's going to happen. But I think that it's fair for us to come together and say, no foreign money in Ohio elections.\"\n\nOhio law requires presidential and vice presidential nominees to be \"certified to the secretary of state or nominated\" through one of several manners \"on or before the ninetieth day before the day of the general election.\" That makes Aug. 7 -- 12 days before the start of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago -- the state's deadline this year.\n\nThe issue has come up in previous elections in Ohio and other states, but until now had typically been resolved without acrimony or fanfare. Democrats and Republicans both had late August conventions in 2012 and 2020.\n\nJustin Levitt, a Loyola Law School professor who served as a senior policy adviser for democracy and voting rights in the Biden White House, said if the Legislature doesn't resolve the matter, a pricey legal fight almost certainly will.\n\n\"The only question is whether it's fixed cheaply, or expensively, or in a friendly manner or in a non-friendly manner, but it's going to get fixed,\" Levitt said. \"This is the easiest lawsuit ever if they bring it, because the law actually asks for a reason if you're going to impede somebody's ballot access, and there's no reason why Ohio needs this answer [on who the Democratic presidential nominee is] as early as it does.\"\n\n\"The fact that we're even here at this point, it's a little bit like a toddler holding its breath,\" Levitt added. \"The outcome is inevitable. It's only a question of how embarrassing it is for the toddler in the meantime.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

However, the Ohio House did not take a vote on the Senate-passed bill or approve its own fix, amended into long-dormant legislation on Tuesday.\n\nThe two chambers, each of which are dominated by Republicans, disagreed about whether to charge a political price for saving Biden's bacon: passing stalled Senate GOP legislation, opposed by Democrats, that would restrict foreign contributions to state ballot-issue campaigns.\n\nGiven bills in Ohio usually don't take effect for 90 days, Gov. Mike DeWine would need to sign a Biden ballot-access bill by Thursday for it to enter into force by Aug. 7. Lawmakers aren't scheduled to meet again until May 22.\n\nLawmakers could pass a bill with an \"emergency clause\" allowing it to take effect immediately, but there's no sign so far that there's the two-thirds support in both the House and Senate needed to authorize such a move.\n\nDespite Wednesday's impasse, legislators on both sides of the aisle, as well as DeWine, continued to give assurances Wednesday that Biden will not become the first major-party presidential nominee in modern history to be unintentionally excluded from any state's ballot.\n\nThe option discussed most frequently is for a federal judge to order Biden's name on Ohio ballots, though some have also floated the vague possibility of national Democrats taking some sort of step to certify Biden as their party's presidential nominee before Aug. 7 in a way that satisfies Ohio law.\n\n\"I'm confident that [Biden] will be on the ballot,\" said Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, a Lakewood Democrat, after Wednesday's Senate session. \"It benefits everyone that he's on the ballot.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the House overhauled Senate Bill 92, a long-dormant elections bill, to move the state's presidential candidate certification deadline to Aug. 23, the day after the Democratic National Convention is set to end.\n\nHowever, on Wednesday morning, Senate Republicans amended a different bill, House Bill 114, to give a one-time exemption allowing Biden to be on the ballot. State lawmakers passed similar one-time exemptions for both major-party presidential nominees who had the same problem in 2012 and 2020.\n\nBut Republican senators also folded in Senate Bill 215, which would prohibit anyone who's not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident to contribute money to statewide ballot-issue campaigns.\n\nSB215 was introduced after Democrats scored two key wins on statewide ballot measures last year with the help of deep-pocketed liberal, out-of-state dark-money groups, one of which got $9 million from Hansjorg Wyss, a Swiss billionaire. Republican backers of SB215 say foreign money shouldn't affect Ohio ballot initiatives, though Democratic opponents claim it's a thinly veiled attempt to hamstring the types of citizen groups that got last year's ballot measures passed.\n\nThe Senate passed its fix on a party-line vote, with the chamber's seven Democrats voting against it. The House never took up the legislation, though, and didn't vote Wednesday on the bill it had amended the day before. Republicans hold supermajorities in both chambers.\n\nSenate President Matt Huffman, a Lima Republican, told reporters after Wednesday's Senate session that his fellow Senate Republicans didn't want to help get Biden on the ballot while SB215 was languishing.\n\n\"Eventually, Joe Biden is going to be on the ballot, through whatever means that's going to happen,\" Huffman said. \"But I think it's fair for us to come together and say, 'No foreign money in Ohio elections.'\"\n\nA couple hours after the Senate vote, House Speaker Jason Stephens adjourned the House without voting on HB114, amid a chorus of objections and boos from some of his fellow Republicans.\n\nStephens, a Lawrence County Republican, told reporters afterward that he believes Biden will end up on the November ballot in Ohio, but in a way that doesn't involve the state legislature passing a bill.\n\nDemocrats, he said, could take a \"different vote, or however they do it.\" He also said there's still the possibility - however remote - of passing legislation with an emergency clause.\n\n\"It's a technical issue,\" Stephens said. \"So it should be able to be done.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Allison Russo, a Democrat from suburban Columbus, said it's \"close to unlikely\" now that Biden will make the ballot thanks to state legislators. But she said there's still \"the court option,\" as well as an \"interparty fix,\" left to try.\n\n\"But listen, Biden will be on the ballot,\" Russo said. \"We've always known that the legislative fix is not the only route.\"\n\nJake Zuckerman contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It's the how and when that remain a mystery.\n\nSenate Republicans wanted to use Biden's predicament as leverage to pass a ban on foreign nationals contributing to ballot campaigns.\n\nThe legislation stemmed from the involvement in a pair of heated ballot campaigns last year of Hansj\u00f6rg Wyss, a Swiss billionaire who has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years into 501(c) nonprofit organizations backing liberal U.S. political causes. A January report issued by LaRose found that over $207 million flowing from Wyss-backed entities went to three groups that, in turn, donated a combined $3.9 million to help pass November's Issue 1, the abortion measure, and to thwart an earlier proposed constitutional amendment that would have made passing it more difficult.\n\nIn order to garner the necessary Republican votes to help Biden out, Republican Senate President Matt Huffman said a compromise was struck to combine the foreign nationals legislation with the language adjusting the ballot deadline. Both proposals were folded into another bill allowing candidates to pay for child care with campaign funds.\n\nAfter fractious debate, the measure cleared the Senate along party lines. Democrats called combining the measures \"a dirty trick\" and \"the worst kind of politics.\"\n\nHuffman said: \"Eventually Joe Biden is going to be on the ballot through whatever means. I think that's fair for us to come together and also say no foreign money in Ohio elections.\"\n\nBut GOP House Speaker Jason Stephens, who depends on the support of minority Democrats to keep his job, had been working on a different solution.\n\nStephens had in mind a \"clean\" bill that called for moving this year's ballot deadline to Aug. 23, the day after Democrats' convention. It also included a long-term solution allowing extensions in future years when either party's nominating convention falls less than 90 days before the election.\n\nThis would be the third time since 2012 that Ohio has had to change its ballot deadline to accommodate conflicts faced by presidential candidates of both parties.\n\nBut that House plan stalled after it was informally passed, and when Stephens declined to call a vote on the Senate's ballot fix, the chamber erupted. Fellow Republicans aligned against Stephens jeered and booed. Some cried, \"Shame!\"\n\nLaRose, who initially identified the calendar glitch, issued a statement condemning the House's inaction. Though the chamber's majority is Republican, he said it appeared that \"Democrats are more interested in protecting foreign billionaires who want to bankroll Ohio's elections than in getting their presidential candidate on the ballot.\"\n\nHe pointed out that the House still has time to act with an emergency vote, which requires a two-thirds majority and allows a bill to become effective immediately.\n\nOn Thursday, LaRose took his criticism further -- bringing up Wyss by name.\n\n\"There's one person at this point who's responsible for keeping Joe Biden off the ballot in Ohio, and it's a Swiss billionaire you've probably never heard of,\" he said in a statement. He alleged Democrats have \"become dependent on Wyss's dark money to fund everything from their ballot campaigns to their fake news operations.\"\n\nState Sen. Bill DeMora, a Columbus Democrat, accused LaRose of politicizing his office and said blaming Democrats for the lack of a ballot resolution is \"almost so sad it's funny.\"\n\n\"It is not the Democrats' fault that the Republicans are infighting and can't govern, but the Secretary is just trying to please right-wing extremists instead of doing his job to avoid further embarrassment,\" he said in a statement. \"This debacle falls squarely on the MAGA cult Republican supermajority in both chambers who only hold power because of the unconstitutionally gerrymandered maps that LaRose voted for.\"\n\nWyss was born in Bern, Switzerland in 1935. He now lives in Wyoming.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He contends that there wouldn't have been enough Republican votes to pass the Senate's bill, made worse by the fact that several Republicans, including Rep. Bernie Willis, R-Springfield, left session early.\n\n\"We didn't take up the vote,\" Stephens told reporters after session. \"We didn't have a consensus on how to get that done today between the House and the Senate and all parties involved.\"\n\nWednesday's move to skip over a chance to pass GOP priority legislation along with the ballot fix angered a handful of GOP House members, many of which have been consistently pitted against Stephens since he assumed power with the help of Democrats.\n\n\"(It) would have kept foreign money out of our elections, but obviously the speaker, once again, cut a deal with the Democrats that blocked us from voting,\" Rep. Phil Plummer, R-Butler Twp., told the Dayton Daily News after session. \"This is another example that he's led by the Democrats. This is a very important issue.\"\n\nPlummer said Stephens' decision Wednesday likely turned pro-Stephens lawmakers against him, which may create a window of opportunity for Plummer and various other anti-Stephens GOP lawmakers to remove Stephens from power.\n\nThe entire dynamic is further complicated by an ongoing battle for power among GOP lawmakers. Stephens -- hoping to retain his seat next year -- has generally been hesitant with Senate proposals, particularly those with full support of Senate President Matt Huffman, who is likely to run for House speaker next year.\n\nAnd, given that Republicans hold a super majority in both chambers, Democrats are entirely dependent upon GOP lawmakers reaching not only across the aisle but also across bitter divides within its own party.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, called the campaign finance portion of the Senate's ballot fix solution a \"poison pill.\"\n\n\"They're playing games with this. We had a clean option that everyone had agreed to -- leadership in Senate Republicans and House Republicans -- and they couldn't help themselves. They wanted to play politics,\" Russo said after session.\n\nWednesday's standstill wasn't entirely unexpected. Even on Tuesday, when things looked positive for Democrats, Russo told reporters on Tuesday that her party is looking at options outside the legislature to ensure Biden gets on the ballot, including a lawsuit.\n\nBiden's campaign is still convinced that the incumbent president will be on the November ballot in Ohio, but has remained relatively mum on what specific recourse options bring them such confidence.\n\n\"Joe Biden will be on the ballot in all 50 states,\" the Biden campaign said in a statement to the Dayton Daily News. \"Election after election, states across the country have acted in line with the bipartisan consensus and taken the necessary steps to ensure the presidential nominees from both parties will be on the ballot.\"\n\n------\n\nFor more stories like this, sign up for our Ohio Politics newsletter.

Once they return, they could pass a bill with an \"emergency clause\" that would let it take effect immediately, but there's no sign so far that there's the two-thirds support in either of the Republican-dominated Ohio General Assembly chambers that would be needed to do so.\n\nDemocrats are still hoping for a legislative fix to keep Biden from becoming the first major-party presidential nominee in modern history to be unintentionally excluded from any state's ballot, but say a lawsuit is also a potential remedy.\n\nIn a statement, Biden campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak reiterated the assertion that the incumbent president will be on the ballot in all 50 states, noting that Alabama and Washington state have recently resolved the same problem with the DNC taking place after their respective candidate certification deadlines.\n\n\"Election after election, states across the country have acted in line with the bipartisan consensus and taken the necessary steps to ensure the presidential nominees from both parties will be on the ballot,\" Lutvak said Wednesday. \"And this election is no different.\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine on Wednesday told reporters that Biden's name would definitely end up on Ohio's presidential ballot predicting: \"If it doesn't get fixed here, it's gonna get fixed by the court.\"\n\nCapital University ballot access and constitutional law expert Mark Brown expects that if Democrats take the case to court, they'd file a federal civil rights case against Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose. It would claim that excluding Biden from the ballot violates the Constitution's First Amendment, which guarantees free speech, and its Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law.\n\nAs precedent, Brown cites a 1983 U.S. Supreme Court decision that determined an Ohio law requiring a March filing deadline for independent presidential candidates violated those constitutional provisions by placing an unconstitutional burden on the voting and associational rights of independent candidates' supporters.\n\nThe case was filed after backers of 1980 independent presidential candidate John Anderson submitted nominating petitions to Ohio's then-Secretary of State Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr. in May of that year instead of March. He refused to accept them because they missed the deadline.\n\n\"By limiting the opportunities of independent-minded voters to associate in the electoral arena to enhance their political effectiveness as a group, such restrictions threaten to reduce diversity and competition in the marketplace of ideas,\" said Justice John Paul Stevens' decision in Anderson v. Celebrezze.\n\nBrown said a March U.S. Supreme Court decision in Trump v. Anderson that stopped Colorado from excluding Donald Trump from the state's presidential ballot under a constitutional provision involving insurrection might also be invoked in a case against the Ohio law.\n\n\"The Supreme Court, at oral argument and then in its opinion, made much of the fact that we'd have a political tit for tat if Colorado was allowed to get Trump off the ballot, and another state could kick Biden off,\" said Brown. \"The Supreme Court said we've really got to avoid that.\"\n\nBrown said that when states put in arduous ballot qualification requirements, they're usually struck down. Noting that Ohio has one of the earliest deadlines in the country for November ballot access under the law, he predicted it would be \"easy pickings\" to challenge it on civil rights grounds. He expects such a case would challenge the law itself and the administration of the law\n\nHe said it would be difficult for Ohio to defend the time requirements in its law as necessary since so many other states manage to conduct their elections when the candidates names are submitted later. The fact that Ohio has made exceptions to the law several times in the past to accommodate other late conventions is another strike against it.\n\nWhile Brown predicts that Democrats would choose to pursue the case in federal court, he said it would also be possible for them to bring a discrimination case under state law that would note Ohio's Secretary of the State has previously allowed minor political parties such as the Libertarians to secure ballot access with \"stand-in\" candidates when their convention was too late for the law, and it is not making the same accommodation this time around. He predicted such a case would be filed in Ohio's Supreme Court.\n\nNotre Dame University election law expert Derek Muller said it would be a safer bet for Democrats to continue seeking a legislative remedy than to take their chances in court. He noted that lawmakers in other states with similar laws, such as Alabama, were able to alter the filing deadline to a date that would work with this year's Democratic convention date.\n\nHe says defenders of the state law might be able to successfully argue in federal court that \"this is sort of a self inflicted wound from Democratic Party,\" as they made a deliberate choice to hold a late convention.\n\nHe said that on the flip side, one could argue the state's interest in having such an early deadline would be \"a very marginal reason to exclude this candidate without sort of some justification and other states are able to do it.\"\n\n\"I think it has a chance of a likelihood of success, I just don't know how strong that likelihood is,\" says Muller.\n\nCase Western Reserve University law professor emeritus Jonathan Entin says the Ohio and Colorado Supreme Court precedents that would likely be cited in a federal court aren't perfect analogies for the situation Biden currently faces in Ohio, and judges might not agree they should apply.\n\nHe said Ohio's General Assembly should rethink requiring such an early filing deadline for presidential candidates, since it has had to make exceptions in several elections since the law was passed. For instance, the legislature tweaked the deadline in 2020 and 2012 for both major parties.\n\n\"I wonder whether the court would would be comfortable, simply ordering Biden onto the ballot, when the problem was created by the legislature in the first place and the legislature could resolve the problem,\" says Entin. \"It might be that a court would say that that state has to accept some kind of an alternative certification. We're talking about a major party where everybody knows who the nominee is going to be so the kind of contingencies you might want to plan for like a brokered convention don't apply here.\"\n\nHe said a court could also stipulate that any deadline that keeps a major party candidate off the ballot can't be justified. The court wouldn't have to say what the deadline should be, but it could rule that the current deadline is \"clearly is preventing the state from running an orderly presidential election.\"\n\n\"The idea that some people in the legislature are prepared to hold out and wait until some court tells them to do their job is to me the height of their responsibility,\" says Entin.", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_DeWine", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike DeWine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Anderson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John B.

Alabama Republicans generously resolved the matter by granting the Democrats an exemption. Biden is facing the same situation in Ohio, caused by the same scheduling issues. However, he's not faring quite as well there, or at least not yet. The Ohio GOP has thus far not seemed to be in such a generous mood and a measure intended to resolve the issue and allow Biden to be on the ballot anyway passed in the state Senate, but stalled in the House without a vote. The trouble is that today is the deadline for putting such a change through and having it take effect in time for the convention. (NBC News)\n\nAn effort to ensure that President Joe Biden is on Ohio's general election ballot stalled Wednesday in the Legislature, raising the likelihood of legal action to resolve the issue.\n\nIt's the latest twist in what has usually been a straightforward move to fix conflicts between late conventions and state election laws in the past.\n\nThis time, with their own convention scheduled for July, Republicans appear less inclined to help Democrats without something in return.\n\nOddly, the House had already passed a bill that would have granted the Democrats an extension and it had support from the GOP. But rather than voting on that measure, the Senate introduced its own bill that would do the same thing but also included a provision to ban foreign contributions to state ballot measure campaigns. Since the two bills don't match, they would need to be reconciled. Alternatively, the House GOP could abandon their own bill and take up a vote on the Senate version. There was no announcement as to whether such a vote would take place today.\n\nIf the Ohio legislature can't get this mess cleaned up today, they would then have to seek a second extraordinary exception allowing the new voting law to take effect sooner than it normally would under standard state laws. Those are a lot of hoops to ask the GOP to jump through just to put Joe Biden on the ballot. Given Ohio's critical position as a swing state that both candidates need to carry, these developments become even more interesting. Trump won Ohio in 2020 by eight points, roughly the same margin of victory he enjoyed over Hillary Clinton in 2016. But now it's 2024 and the world has been turned upside down. The latest poll showed Trump leading Biden by twelve in the Buckeye State, but that might be meaningless six months from now.\n\nSince it's now apparently at least in the realm of possibility, what would it mean if Joe Biden failed to make it onto the ballot in Ohio this November? I assume all of his supporters would need to write his name in. Whether that would produce some sort of negative impact on Biden's numbers is unknown because we've never had a sitting president show up as a write-in candidate before. Also, as more and more locations adopt digital scanners and other electronic voting machines, submitting a write-in candidate's name can become more complicated. It could potentially slow down the count in Ohio on election night if nothing else.\n\nPersonally, I would prefer to see the Ohio GOP get in gear and just pass one of the bills before the deadline, even though I'm not a resident there and don't really have a say in the matter. I very much want Joe Biden to be replaced in the upcoming election. In fact, I think it's critical to the future of the nation that this happens. But if Donald Trump is to be victorious, he should win the race fair and square, not through any sort of ballot trickery. We don't need another round of fights over election integrity or the accuracy of the vote count. We need to get down to work fixing all of the damage Biden and the Democrats have inflicted since the start of 2021.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jazz_shaw@hotair.com", "name": "Jazz Shaw", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California State Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-in_candidate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Write-in candidate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voting machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/116/526a7f80-2a1c-4a2f-a912-2d908114562b.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546979", "eventUri": "eng-9546979", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

The stories we have to talk about today are fascinating. It is Today in Ohio. It's the news podcast discussion from cleveland .com and the Plain Dealer. I'm Chris Quinn here with Lisa Garvin, Laura Johnston and Leila Tasi and Leila, you're up first. Despite all their talk to the contrary.\n\nMatt Huffman and Jason Stevens are not doing what it takes to ensure Joe Biden is on the November ballot. Why did things break down? And what is the next step for those trying to ensure that Ohio voters get the basic right to vote for the candidate of their choice in November?\n\nLeila (00:40.945)\n\nWell, the state legislature was expected yesterday to approve a fix that would make sure Biden makes the ballot, even though he won't be formally nominated until after the state's August 7th deadline for political parties to submit their presidential tickets. But the Ohio house did not take a vote on the Senate passed bill or approve its own fix. It seems that the breakdown was because the two chambers, which are both dominated by Republicans, disagreed about whether to.\n\ncharge a political price for solving this problem for the Democrats. On Tuesday, the House overhauled this long dormant elections bill, Senate Bill 92, to move the state's presidential candidate certification deadline to August 23rd, which would give the Democrats time for their national convention to come to a conclusion. However, on Wednesday morning, Senate Republicans amended a different bill, House Bill 114, to give a one -time exemption allowing Biden to be on the ballot.\n\nState lawmakers passed similar one -time exemptions for both major party presidential nominees who had the same problem in 2012 and 2020. But Republican senators also folded into that bill this time around. Senate Bill 215. This bill would prohibit anyone who's not a U .S. citizen or permanent resident to contribute money to statewide ballot issue campaigns. And that bill had previously stalled in the House. So they're trying to get it through on the back of this other one. The Senate\n\npassed its fix on a party line vote with the chamber, seven Democrats voting against it. The house never took up that legislation though, and didn't vote Wednesday on it, on the bill that it had amended the day before. So now it seems we're kind of running out of time to make this ballot fix. Bills take effect after 90 days. So for a Biden ballot access bill to take effect by August 7th, the governor would have to sign it by this Thursday. And -\n\nLawmakers don't meet again until May 22nd. So now it could either be up to a federal judge to order Biden's name on the Ohio ballot, or the national Democrats could do something to certify Biden as their nominee before August 7th.\n\nchris (02:49.871)\n\nOkay, okay. There's a mechanical flaw in the argument they're making here, but let's make this as simple as we can. Matt Hoffman and Jason Stevens vowed to Ohio, they would fix this. It's a very simple thing to do. Very simple law. Nothing complicated about this. And they said, Ohio, we've got this. So there's one of two things that are true here. They are the most incompetent buffoons we've ever seen on the Ohio stage because they can't do something so basic.\n\nas pass a simple one sentence bill, or they're liars who never intended to get this done and pushed it to the end of the deadline by lying to Ohio saying, we got this, we got this, oops, too late. I guess it has to go to the courts, which is worse, that they're incompetent clowns on a national stage embarrassing Ohio or sinister liars who never intended to do the right thing. I'm not sure what the answer is.\n\nLeila (03:45.553)\n\nI take issue with your point that only one of those two things is true.\n\nchris (03:49.071)\n\nBut here's the other thing, they're using the seventh as their deadline. That's not the deadline. I mean, they could let that happen on the seventh, but if they pass the law in the next whatever number of days, they could change it. So yeah, the seventh law would apply, but the other law would go into effect in time to get it done and obviate the one that says the seventh.\n\nI mean, they're using that, you know, the deadline's the seventh. And so, oh, well, that's in stone. But if they changed it tomorrow, it would that law would eventually expire and the new law would take effect and they could put Joe Biden on the ballot. So I don't even believe what they're saying. But this is just terrible for what Ohio looks like in modern history. This hasn't happened. And they told us repeatedly, we got this.\n\nLisa (04:13.98)\n\nThey're using the maximum, but the deadline is the seventh, and so oh well, that's it.\n\nLisa (04:41.212)\n\ngot this. Don't worry. This isn't about hard. So they're dopes or they're liars and that's what we got in Ohio. Really bad things in Ohio. Good listening today in Ohio. Case Western Reserve University did something we have not yet seen elsewhere with protesters on their campus. Laura, what happened? They've needed hope for that. And when we first posted it yesterday, they're like, wait, what? What are you talking about? And so protesters have been...\n\nchris (04:41.999)\n\nDon't worry, this isn't about politics. So they're dopes or they're liars. And that's what we have for Ohio. Really bad day for Ohio. You're listening to Today in Ohio. Case Western Reserve University did something we have not yet seen elsewhere with the protesters on their campus. Laura, what happened?\n\nlaura (05:01.518)\n\nThey painted over them. And when you first told this, when I told you this yesterday, they're like, wait, what? What are you talking about? And so protesters had painted what is called an advocacy and spirit wall on the Case Western Reserve campus. This is one of those like rocks they have at a high school where you are allowed to paint on it. This is not considered graffiti. This is where students express themselves. So they put pro -Palestinian messages on this as part of this 10 day protest and encampment they've had at Case Western Reserve.\n\nLisa (05:22.46)\n\nSo they've quite close Palestinian message office as part of this 10 day protest in Cancun.\n\nlaura (05:30.958)\n\nIt included, I dream of breaking the siege and come together in peace. But the parts of it, at least the officials in the administration said was anti -Semitic and they wanted to wipe that out. So they hired contractors to paint over the wall on Monday night, but students stood in front of that. It's like standing in front of a bulldozer if you want to protect a park, right? They didn't want the wall to be painted, so they stood in front of it. And the contractors, while police looked on, spray painted.\n\nover students. This is incredibly hard to believe, but the video was right there on X, which used to be known as Twitter. So it was like, okay, there's the story.\n\nchris (06:09.679)\n\nI still can't believe this. Think about what's going on here. It's a wall that gets painted all the time. And the campus says, let's get those messages off. We don't want them. The kids stand in front of the wall. The guys are painting it. And you get to this moment where they're in the way. And the painters say to the police, what should we do? The police, astoundingly, don't say, don't do anything. We can come back later. They just stand there confused. And the solution becomes, let's spray paint all over the students.\n\nthe wall, the guy's a painter and he gets in this apartment and he's covering the way. And the painter says to the police, what can you do? The police, the Saturday police, don't say, don't do anything, please come back later. They just stand there.\n\nchris (06:38.799)\n\nWhat are they thinking? That is never the right way to go. I just couldn't believe that's what they did. They're spraying the kids, you know, and paint has chemicals in it. So it's probably a legitimate health concern. The students now have that aerosolized chemicals were sprayed in their breathing space.\n\nlaura (06:56.654)\n\nYeah, well, practically right into their mouth. I mean, their faces got painted over. It is incredible. And President of CASE, Eric Kaler, said the college is going to hold the individuals responsible for this behavior, including the failure of our own officers to intervene. He offered sincere regret. He said, as any violation of codes of conduct, they'll take action to hold them accountable. But come on. I mean, I do feel like the buck stops here. Although, when you hire someone to paint a wall, do you have to tell them?\n\nPlease, when you're painting this wall, do not paint over any children. I mean, it's bizarre.\n\nBut there's the thing is, think about it. You have multiple options. OK, you can stop painting and come back later. The police could tell them you're obstructing official business, so you have to move or we'll move you. And then they could gently arrest them. And they could do all sorts of things. And instead, they painted them. I just mind. And that puts us on a national stage. You haven't seen that anywhere else. That's a national story. What are they doing in Ohio to deal with protesters? They are painting them. It's just.\n\nBut we really don't know who's at the bottom of it. I mean, were the contractors worried about losing their jobs and that's why they kept going? I mean, nobody, who told them to keep going? I mean, there seems to be a breakdown of communication here.\n\nBut it but right, right, there is clearly a breakdown of something. But how you in all of that conclude that well, I'll just keep spray painting and we'll paint the kids in front of the wall. You're not accomplishing your goal of painting the wall. The kids are in the way when they walk away. The walls not painted. It's just\n\nRight. I think the breakdown in communication is between their brain and the arm that's doing the spraying. Come on.\n\nI just it's one of those and Lars right Laura told me this I said what what are you talking about and she said the videos are ready on Twitter. Okay well that's great news for Cleveland we're in the national spotlight yet again go Cavs.\n\nAnd the thing is, the wall has already been painted over again. It's been painted with a pro -Israel message, and that was what we reported yesterday. So it's probably been painted over again by this point. This is a wall that is painted all the time, and this is just a bizarre action that only escalated what are already high tensions on case, which is in day 11 of this at this point. They told the students to go, you know, stop camping out there. But aside from the 20 detainees on the first day,\n\nhaven't had any arrests. One of the students who was painted over did talk to Molly Walsh. He's actually a freshman at the University of Cincinnati, but has been there the entire time. So yeah, it is a huge head scratcher, and it's going to have big implications.\n\nchris (09:31.055)\n\nEric Heller's tried to thread the needle on this, which is nearly impossible to do. Can you imagine what he felt when he was told about this? It's like, what do you say? I mean, he must've just hung his head and thought, oh man, we have a few days left of classes. Why, why, why?\n\nHe'd be like, are you like, well, I'm sure he used harsher language than are you kidding me?\n\nYou're listening to Today in Ohio. Here's another blockbuster of a story. Mike DeWine is seeing what he describes as a huge red flag. That's a quote, huge red flag with the folks running the state teacher retirement system. And this is not 18 months after the state auditor said the place is clean. Lisa, what alerted him? What does he say about it? And what is he doing about the huge red flag?\n\nLisa (10:21.148)\n\nSo Governor DeWine is concerned about potential wrongdoing at STRS and he sent dozens of documents to the State Ethics Commission, Attorney General Dave Yost, Auditor Keith Faber, Treasurer Robert Sprague, the Ohio Retirement Study Council and other groups. He's worried about reformers on the STRS board that may hurt the fund in the long run. And currently the reformers, so -called, have a six to five advantage on the board. One of them,\n\nis Wade Steen. He was removed by DeWine a year ago after Steen refused his request to resign, but then Steen sued and was reinstated by an appellate court on April 18th. So DeWine's concerns kind of focus on this Irish consultant that was hired by STRS. It's called Aon. They severed their contract with STRS. They were hired after a May 2022 audit that found governance issues, policy gaps, and other issues. And\n\nDeWine says that Aon's departure indicates that the issues are too concerning to ignore. He said that the docs include information that Steen and other reformers on the board were pushing for a private investment entity to take over. This entity had a leader with less than five years experience, was not registered as an investment advisor. So yeah, it seems like there might be some legitimate concerns here. We're talking about a 94 %\n\nbillion dollar pension plan. People in STRS have not got a cost of living allowance from 2017 to 2022, unlike other Ohio pensions.\n\nchris (11:56.207)\n\nYeah, I mean, I went back to look to see when that audit that audit might have been done in May, but it wasn't released till December of 2022. So after years and years of educators saying this thing's crooked, bad things are happening, we're not getting our our money, there were questions about it all. Keith Faber went in, looked at it and said, you know, there's some transparency issues, but I find no issues whatsoever. Now, suddenly, it is a crisis. The number of agencies that the wine sent that to saying they all have a piece of this.\n\nSo it's partly criminal. It's partly an audit. It's the secretary of state. What would it be with him? Is there some election fraud going on? It's just mind boggling. And the governor doesn't do this. He doesn't put out press releases saying, you know, I respect the Keith Faber did an audit and I respect this, but what's happening there is a huge red flag to me. And I have materials in my possession that need full investigation, which Laura, we have those now, right? We're going through them.\n\nlaura (12:54.35)\n\nYes, we have those and Laura Hancock had a lot of detail and background in her story of all of the things with SCRS because it's been in the news for a long time.\n\nI know. The thing that was the surprise was the audit that said nothing to see here, which was good news. It was like, OK, good. The money's safe, and they've got some procedural issues, but we're good. Now you're wondering, what did the audit miss? And do they know what they're doing? The whole purpose of an audit is red flags.\n\nlaura (13:25.742)\n\nThe thing about Wade Steen is weird because he used to be a fiscal officer in Cuyahoga County. He was hired by Ed Fitzgerald, so 2010 -ish. I reported a lot on that office and met with him. He never came across to me as like an out of bounds reformer. So the whole suing to get back on the board thing and his beef with the wine, that's really interesting. And I don't know what that all means.\n\nchris (13:52.431)\n\nFull disclosure, my wife is a year away from retirement, so I would be a beneficiary of this at some point. So people should know that. That's not why we're talking about it, but just full disclosure, we're transparent if the fund is not.\n\nWell, Chris, full disclosure, I taught two semesters at CSU, so I have something like $60 in STRS just waiting for me when I retire.\n\nAnd apparently, and there's been a lot of turmoil for years apparently here. Some retired teachers actually hired a Florida pension expert and that expert was kind of suspicious of the fees that the pension is paying to Wall Street money managers for things like alternative investments, real estate, and so on and so forth. So there's just a lot of turmoil under the surface.\n\nThis also shows that when Mike DeWine wants to, he can get things done, which is why it's been so frustrating about the drilling in state parks and all of the other egregious state actions of late that he's not stopped. When he wants to, he can raise an alarm.\n\nlaura (14:51.118)\n\nAnd I just wanted to point out that, you know, we're talking about a whole lot of money here and all of these public officials looking into this. What really is on the line is I think it's 500 '000 -ish teachers and retirees that depend on this for, you know, their life to live on. So that's why it matters so much.\n\nchris (15:09.519)\n\nAnd that's what the wine said. You're listening to Today in Ohio. It's not just Brook Park real estate that the Cleveland Browns have had their eye on. Laura, they've been buying up a lot of land around their practice facility in Berea. What's the plan?\n\nlaura (15:23.886)\n\nSo we're talking about 16 acres here, mostly a residential neighborhood that has seen better times and has been kind of rough since the trains greatly expanded in that north side of Berea. So the city is all for some kind of redevelopment by the Browns. There's been dozens of homes cleared. But the Browns, even though they say they want to start construction in 2024, there doesn't seem to be a very clear plan on what they want to construct.\n\nPlans could include a hotel, a mixture of office space, retail and housing, a new rec center and community fields for sports. So even though they filed an application with the city that includes a lot of that idea, we haven't seen any plan of where things would go where. Berea is asking for $15 million of state funding for a multi -purpose sports field that would be used by the city, the schools and Baldwin Wallace, as well as money for a new rec center, which\n\nSounds great, but we don't know exactly what the Browns intend to do with their land.\n\nchris (16:24.943)\n\nWhat's fascinating is when you look at the map that we published of the plots they bought, they had to buy one by one by one houses and then they tore most of them down. There was one holdout, I guess they're about to buy. But in the end, the city officials say the railroad tracks near this have really severed that part of the city and made it not very much useful. And that what the Browns are doing may kind of sew it back into the fabric of the community with.\n\ncommunity use, which is great. I mean, if the brands are doing something with that, that brings the community more into it and as they develop their own facility, that would be pretty wonderful.\n\nYeah, and we're talking about $200 million of private investment here, which is far from $2 .4 billion, but still a good chunk of money. And when they have those practice days in August, so many people go down to Berea to see them and to get a look at the Browns before the season starts. So if there was more things to do, if there was a hotel for people to stay right there, maybe people would come from farther away, make it a weekend, restaurants, the same kind of multipurpose.\n\nentertainment district that they're talking about putting in Brook Park, if they put a smaller version in Berea, I think Berea would welcome it. It's near the airport. So there's not a lot of development around there. If you go to the IEX Center, it's like, you know, it's a barn in the middle of nowhere.\n\nchris (17:44.815)\n\nI think it's just delightful to see the Browns spending their own money to develop something. What a concept. You're listening to Today in Ohio. The higher education financial crisis continues unabated. What did Cleveland State University President, Larb Bloomberg, drop at the State House on Wednesday?\n\nLeila (18:07.313)\n\nThis is another story about the enrollment cliff that colleges and universities are facing because of the decrease in the number of people of childbearing age, fewer people are having kids and more young people are questioning the value of a college education versus the high debt that often comes with it. And Bloomberg told state senators Tuesday that despite a buyout that was recently announced at CSU, they are going to also likely need to cut more employees.\n\nLisa (18:27.388)\n\nTuesday that despite a buyout that was recently announced at CSU, they are going to also likely need to cut more employees. CSU was built for 17 '000 students. And enrollment this past fall hovered around 14 ,500.\n\nLeila (18:36.849)\n\nCSU was built for 17 ,000 students and enrollment this past fall hovered around 14 ,500. Bloomberg said that this downward trend is expected to continue. They expect to be down to 13 ,000 students by 2030 or maybe even sooner than that. In notes that she submitted to the legislature, Bloomberg said that without changes to the status quo, the school could face a budget deficit of $30 million by around 2029. Last summer, the school...\n\nLisa (18:44.092)\n\nsaid that this downward trend is expected to continue. They expect to be down to 13 ,000 students by 2030 or maybe even sooner. In notes that she submitted to the legislature, Bloomberg said that without changes to the status quo, the school could face the budget deficit of 30 million dollars by 2012.\n\nsome of the school began developing a plan for organization or resilience and financial stability. It's unclear when or where this next round of cuts is going to happen at CSU, but Cleveland State also has asked auditor, keep favor for performance audit to examine how it uses states and the long term maintenance costs of other departments to get a handle on that.\n\nLeila (19:05.457)\n\nbegan developing a plan for organizational resilience and financial stability. It's unclear when or where this next round of cuts is going to happen at CSU, but Cleveland State also has asked auditor Keith Faber for a performance audit to examine how it uses space and buildings on campus, long -term maintenance costs, and other capital needs to kind of get a handle on that.\n\nchris (19:27.375)\n\nThese universities are all struggling and they're all trying to figure a path. When is somebody on the state level going to coordinate this so that there's an organized fashion in how we approach it? Kyle, it's cutthroat right now and this is more bad news, more cuts, more teachers. Is that just, is it going to be death by a thousand cuts and the ones that bleed out disappear?\n\nLeila (19:49.393)\n\nI don't know, but I'm concerned, like, you know, Laura and I have kids who are going to be graduating high school in five, six years here. And I feel like that is long enough for a lot of this to start to shake out. I'm wondering what will the landscape look like for our kids when they start to look at colleges? What will college cost? What will be available? What does this mean for kids who, a few years from now, are going to be looking for schools? Will more of them shutter? What are the...\n\nLisa (19:53.884)\n\nI feel like that is long enough for a lot of us to accept the shakeout. I wonder what...\n\nLeila (20:19.473)\n\nWill enrollment be easier? Will it be less competitive? Are kids going to start turning away from college in droves? I have no idea.\n\nDon't worry about it, Leila. I'm sure that Matt Huffman and Jason Stevens will make sure tuition is lower when your kids get to college. They're going to do the right thing. Trust me.\n\nI completely agree with Layla. And as I've watched these college costs climb, I've thought there's got to be a reckoning at some point. And I think this is the beginning of the reckoning because kids are saying no to college. It's not just that the number of available students demographically is down. There are kids that are saying it's not worth the cost. And so the colleges that have been raising the rates while putting in these amazing amenities are going to have to look at.\n\nhow to trim that and how to make college more affordable. And I think some are going to close. And yeah, I agree, Leila. We don't know what the future is going to like, but it's not going to be the status quo.\n\nLisa (21:15.9)\n\nI think that these colleges, all colleges and universities in Ohio need to get together instead of trying to protect their own and protect their own student body. They need to collaborate on this because they will all be affected by this demographic cliff. So better to work together than try and keep, you know, everything to yourself.\n\nWhat does that look like? I mean, a lot of, yeah, what about, but if we're talking about a bunch of private schools, what does it look like to come together to decide who's going to close?\n\nTrade specialties, trade specialties. So some schools who have duplicate specialties start assigning them, start saying, okay, you don't need it because this school has it and we only have X number of students. But that takes leadership. That takes somebody to coordinate the whole thing. And that's what's sorely lacking. And so you got Bloomberg saying, okay, my survival is on the line. I'll cut as I need, but that's not coordinated. It's not good for the citizens of Ohio. It's not good for your kids.\n\nand your kids are picking their specialties, if we have too many that are teaching it, they're all gonna be weak, so they won't get the best education. But if we said, no, Kent is where you're gonna go for this specialty, let's put our resources there, and then your kid wants that specialty, they get one of the best educations.\n\nThat presumes that kids know what kind of specialty they're interested in. But most kids go to college not knowing what they want to do. And that's why they end up like I did at a liberal arts school where you can... And Lisa, we went to the same liberal arts school and you dabble, dabble, dabble. And I...\n\nAs a long time ago, the world has changed since then. You're not as young as you think you are. And you're listening to Today in Ohio. This next one, I wonder if it's tinfoil hat or legitimate threat. Why is Senator Sherrod Brown seeking to ban any vehicle that is made in China and connects to the internet?\n\nSenator Brown sees it as a major national security concern. He sent a letter to the Commerce Department's Information and Communications Technology Office asking to ban all Chinese vehicles that connect to the internet and any smart vehicle technology that was designed, developed, made or supplied from China. He's concerned that the Chinese Communist Party could access Americans' personal data and that of critical U .S. infrastructure through things like navigation and so on and so forth.\n\nThis is in response to a commerce department proposal. They're considering regulation of connected vehicle supply chain. And President Biden has said that connected cars are like smartphones on wheels. They use mobile data networks for navigation. Vehicles can be accessed remotely or disabled. And they actually pointed to an incident in 2023.\n\nThe British prime minister's car had a tracking device that was in a sealed auto part that was imported from China. It was discovered in a forensic sweep. China is a major source of these auto parts. 35 % of the global connected vehicle patents come from China. But the incident about that SIM card sealed in an auto part is a bit concerning.\n\nchris (24:17.071)\n\nThis has been a big debate for the people who use drones. One of the biggest drone manufacturers for people to use is DJI. It's a Chinese company. And there have been nonstop fears that China is using the network of drones in America to map the whole country, that whatever the drone see goes to China, even though there has been no evidence of that, that there's a fear there's a possibility.\n\nYou also know that American car manufacturers have loaded their cars with stuff that tells them how you drive. There's, you know, I get a monthly report card from my car about how it's doing that is all being transmitted to the car manufacturer and then emailed to me. This is not a new thing. What I don't see other than the story from Great Britain is this evidence that China...\n\nis targeting us and finding out everything about us. So is it a threat? Is there real evidence of it? I just don't know. And it seems like we're taking very drastic measures. Sherrod Brown doesn't want us to be able to buy the Chinese electric vehicles because China has invested a ton of money in making them cheaply. They're taking over the world market. And I just wonder if this is another tactic to keep us from being able to buy inexpensive Chinese manufactured EVs.\n\nLisa (25:38.268)\n\nI, you know, of course, you know, we're talking about the same thing with TikTok as well, you know, accessing Americans data. I, I don't know. I, I tend towards the conspiracy theorist a little bit, you know, so I can kind of see his point. It might be a little overblown, but I'm not sure it's, you know, you know, none, you know, negligible.\n\nchris (25:57.903)\n\nYeah, I don't know. That's what I'm saying. It's either tin foil hat or a really serious threat. And I'm not sure which one it is. You're listening to Today in Ohio. We talked about case. Now let's talk about Ohio State. Laura, what did the college president there tell lawmakers about how OSU has treated protesters on its campus?\n\nlaura (26:17.55)\n\nWell, OSU president Ted Carter thinks that they did a pretty good job dealing with the protesters on campus while respecting their rights. Late April, they were snipers staged on top of campus buildings. Cops on the ground, they arrested 36 people on April 25th. This was after a student set up an encampment on the South Oval. He got rave reviews from Jerry Serino. So I'm not sure if that's who you want to be clapping you on the back. But what...\n\nThe president said was that safety at Ohio State will not be compromised and that it was an intentional violation of the university space rules that exist so that teaching, learning, research, service, and patient care can occur without interruption. Carter's pretty new at the school. He started January 1st after leading the University of Nebraska and the U .S. Naval Academy.\n\nchris (27:06.767)\n\nA lot of the colleges are struggling with this as we've discussed. It's a tenuous kind of move. You either clamp down and you can be criticized for clamping down. You let them go too far. You get criticized for letting them go too far. I do think the images of the snipers were a bit much. What is the threat that requires snipers on top of buildings? We had that in Cleveland when the RNC was here in 2016 when every major politico was here. And you say, OK, well, maybe they're because people might do that.\n\nRight, because of an outside threat, not because the crowd itself was a threat.\n\nchris (27:40.559)\n\nYeah, is there any evidence that people are doing anything that would require snipers? It's such a frightening image to look up and see sharpshooters surrounding you. That's an intimidation tactic. So of course, Jerry Serino would like it because he's trying to turn college campuses in Ohio into fascist training centers.\n\nWell, exactly. And so Serino and Carter did find some common ground when they talked about the number of students who are not enrolling, just like we were just talking about. And so Serino's blaming it on campuses being too liberal. And so any conservative student wouldn't want to go to college. And Carter's saying he's watched us change the shift and seeing enrollment numbers across the nation. But when Serino pushed a little further and was like, we shouldn't have DEI programs because they turn people against each other,\n\nCarter didn't quite go there. So definitely more conservative than you're going to see a lot of people on college campuses. But it's an interesting conversation.\n\nchris (28:39.503)\n\nI know. Think about the preposterousness of what he's saying. That we're so liberal, the kids don't want to go to the college. That is just made up nonsense to to shore up his ridiculous push to try and change the curriculum. No surprise that he was clapping him on the back for having the snipers on the building and their treatment. It was over the top, too. It wasn't just, hey, I think you did a good job. Is your model for America?\n\nlaura (29:04.206)\n\nWell, he said that they walk the fine line. I was like, um, that's an interesting way to put it.\n\nYou're listening to Today in Ohio. That's it for the Thursday episode. Good discussion. Thanks for being with us. Thanks, Lisa. Thanks, Laura. Thanks, Leila. Come back Friday.

This year, Biden is expected to be certified on Aug. 22 at the latest, which is 75 days before the Nov. 5 general election.\n\nThe fix was amended into a previously-passed Senate bill and passed unanimously and hurriedly by a House Government Oversight Committee Tuesday. The timing allows the House to vote on the bill during its session on Wednesday and pass the bill back over to the Senate for a concurrence vote.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, said she's been encouraged by the bipartisan action to rectify the situation but noted that she's not celebrating just yet.\n\n\"Around here, every day, you always expect that anything can happen. So, until it's completely done, you know, we'll keep working and having the conversation,\" Russo said when this news organization asked if she expected any push back.\n\nThe bill will need to pass both the House and the Senate with a simple majority. Leaders for the GOP super majorities in both chambers have been receptive to the fix, but the House has a splintered GOP caucus and a rising animosity between Stephens and a sizable cohort of his peers.\n\nIt's the first publicly proposed solution after over a month of mostly behind-closed-doors deliberations, which was sparked by Secretary of State Frank LaRose's letter informing the Biden campaign and the Ohio Democratic Party that his official nomination would be too late to comply with Ohio law.\n\nOhio has had to make legislative fixes on this issue several times -- including amenable solutions for both parties as recently as 2020 -- but the fixes had been narrow and have thus left the state slightly reeling this time around.\n\nStephens and Russo both said they hoped this year's solution will limit problems in the future.\n\n\"I think everyone agreed that this is good for democracy,\" Russo said. \"We want people to have full access to the ballot, and that's good for both parties. It was just a matter of some of the details and hearing those out.\"", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dayton Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "avery_kreemer@daytondailynews.com", "name": "Avery Kreemer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Stephens_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Stephens (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allison_Russo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allison Russo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_LaRose", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank LaRose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Democratic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Democratic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.daytondailynews.com/resizer/DBul5CuJGLYbybGFLF8oyqR9phI=/1200x630/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coxohio/MSPKK7UF45G4TEOP3AZA36AZYU.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546979", "eventUri": "eng-9546979", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-08-22", "textStart": 741, "textEnd": 748}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 792, "textEnd": 798}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

He contends that there wouldn't have been enough Republican votes to pass the Senate's bill, made worse by the fact that several Republicans, including Rep. Bernie Willis, R-Springfield, left session early.\n\n\"We didn't take up the vote,\" Stephens told reporters after session. \"We didn't have a consensus on how to get that done today between the House and the Senate and all parties involved.\"\n\nWednesday's move to skip over a chance to pass GOP priority legislation along with the ballot fix angered a handful of GOP House members, many of which have been consistently pitted against Stephens since he assumed power with the help of Democrats.\n\n\"(It) would have kept foreign money out of our elections, but obviously the speaker, once again, cut a deal with the Democrats that blocked us from voting,\" Rep. Phil Plummer, R-Butler Twp., told the Dayton Daily News after session. \"This is another example that he's led by the Democrats. This is a very important issue.\"\n\nPlummer said Stephens' decision Wednesday likely turned pro-Stephens lawmakers against him, which may create a window of opportunity for Plummer and various other anti-Stephens GOP lawmakers to remove Stephens from power.\n\nThe entire dynamic is further complicated by an ongoing battle for power among GOP lawmakers. Stephens -- hoping to retain his seat next year -- has generally been hesitant with Senate proposals, particularly those with full support of Senate President Matt Huffman, who is likely to run for House speaker next year.\n\nAnd, given that Republicans hold a super majority in both chambers, Democrats are entirely dependent upon GOP lawmakers reaching not only across the aisle but also across bitter divides within its own party.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, called the campaign finance portion of the Senate's ballot fix solution a \"poison pill.\"\n\n\"They're playing games with this.

The House version would allow Biden's name to appear on the ballot while also allowing more time and flexibility for political parties to certify presidential nominees in future elections. After the state Senate voted on its measure Wednesday, the Republican-led House adjourned without considering either version.\n\nRead more: https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/ohio-lawmakers-are-odds-effort-ensure-biden-appears-november-ballot-rcna151369", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-line_vote", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Party-line vote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina House of Representatives"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546979", "eventUri": "eng-9546979", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

But legal experts said that could carry some of its own risk.\n\nOhio's legislature adjourned Wednesday without passing legislation that would let Biden appear on the Nov. 5 ballot even though the Democratic National Convention where he'll be formally nominated will occur after the state's official Aug. 7 deadline for political parties to submit their presidential tickets.\n\nSince bills in Ohio don't usually take effect for 90 days, Gov. Mike DeWine would need to sign a Biden ballot-access bill by Thursday for it to become law by Aug. 7. Lawmakers don't meet again until May 22. Once they return, they could pass a bill with an \"emergency clause\" that would let it take effect immediately, but there's no sign so far that there's the two-thirds support in either of the Republican-dominated Ohio General Assembly chambers that would be needed to do so.\n\nDemocrats are still hoping for a legislative fix to keep Biden from becoming the first major-party presidential nominee in modern history to be unintentionally excluded from any state's ballot, but say a lawsuit is also a potential remedy.\n\nIn a statement, Biden campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak reiterated the assertion that the incumbent president will be on the ballot in all 50 states, noting that Alabama and Washington state have recently resolved the same problem with the DNC taking place after their respective candidate certification deadlines.\n\n\"Election after election, states across the country have acted in line with the bipartisan consensus and taken the necessary steps to ensure the presidential nominees from both parties will be on the ballot,\" Lutvak said Wednesday. \"And this election is no different.\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine on Wednesday told reporters that Biden's name would definitely end up on Ohio's presidential ballot predicting: \"If it doesn't get fixed here, it's gonna get fixed by the court.\"\n\nCapital University ballot access and constitutional law expert Mark Brown expects that if Democrats take the case to court, they'd file a federal civil rights case against Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose. It would claim that excluding Biden from the ballot violates the Constitution's First Amendment, which guarantees free speech, and its Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law.\n\nAs precedent, Brown cites a 1983 U.S. Supreme Court decision that determined an Ohio law requiring a March filing deadline for independent presidential candidates violated those constitutional provisions by placing an unconstitutional burden on the voting and associational rights of independent candidates' supporters.\n\nThe case was filed after backers of 1980 independent presidential candidate John Anderson submitted nominating petitions to Ohio's then-Secretary of State Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr. in May of that year instead of March. He refused to accept them because they missed the deadline.\n\n\"By limiting the opportunities of independent-minded voters to associate in the electoral arena to enhance their political effectiveness as a group, such restrictions threaten to reduce diversity and competition in the marketplace of ideas,\" said Justice John Paul Stevens' decision in Anderson v. Celebrezze.\n\nBrown said a March U.S. Supreme Court decision in Trump v. Anderson that stopped Colorado from excluding Donald Trump from the state's presidential ballot under a constitutional provision involving insurrection might also be invoked in a case against the Ohio law.\n\n\"The Supreme Court, at oral argument and then in its opinion, made much of the fact that we'd have a political tit for tat if Colorado was allowed to get Trump off the ballot, and another state could kick Biden off,\" said Brown. \"The Supreme Court said we've really got to avoid that.\"\n\nBrown said that when states put in arduous ballot qualification requirements, they're usually struck down. Noting that Ohio has one of the earliest deadlines in the country for November ballot access under the law, he predicted it would be \"easy pickings\" to challenge it on civil rights grounds. He expects such a case would challenge the law itself and the administration of the law\n\nHe said it would be difficult for Ohio to defend the time requirements in its law as necessary since so many other states manage to conduct their elections when the candidates names are submitted later. The fact that Ohio has made exceptions to the law several times in the past to accommodate other late conventions is another strike against it.\n\nWhile Brown predicts that Democrats would choose to pursue the case in federal court, he said it would also be possible for them to bring a discrimination case under state law that would note Ohio's Secretary of the State has previously allowed minor political parties such as the Libertarians to secure ballot access with \"stand-in\" candidates when their convention was too late for the law, and it is not making the same accommodation this time around. He predicted such a case would be filed in Ohio's Supreme Court.\n\nNotre Dame University election law expert Derek Muller said it would be a safer bet for Democrats to continue seeking a legislative remedy than to take their chances in court. He noted that lawmakers in other states with similar laws, such as Alabama, were able to alter the filing deadline to a date that would work with this year's Democratic convention date.\n\nHe says defenders of the state law might be able to successfully argue in federal court that \"this is sort of a self inflicted wound from Democratic Party,\" as they made a deliberate choice to hold a late convention.\n\nHe said that on the flip side, one could argue the state's interest in having such an early deadline would be \"a very marginal reason to exclude this candidate without sort of some justification and other states are able to do it.\"\n\n\"I think it has a chance of a likelihood of success, I just don't know how strong that likelihood is,\" says Muller.\n\nCase Western Reserve University law professor emeritus Jonathan Entin says the Ohio and Colorado Supreme Court precedents that would likely be cited in a federal court aren't perfect analogies for the situation Biden currently faces in Ohio, and judges might not agree they should apply.\n\nHe said Ohio's General Assembly should rethink requiring such an early filing deadline for presidential candidates, since it has had to make exceptions in several elections since the law was passed. For instance, the legislature tweaked the deadline in 2020 and 2012 for both major parties.\n\n\"I wonder whether the court would would be comfortable, simply ordering Biden onto the ballot, when the problem was created by the legislature in the first place and the legislature could resolve the problem,\" says Entin. \"It might be that a court would say that that state has to accept some kind of an alternative certification.

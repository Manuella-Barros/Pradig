From Norway to Poland, the drone border will help monitor the Nato bloc through unmanned vehicles, Lithuania\u2019s interior minister said. Agn\u0117 Bilotait\u0117 told news source BNS: \u2018This is a completely new thing\u2014a drone border from Norway to Poland, the purpose of which would be to protect our border with the help of drones and other technologies.\u2019 The drone wall will also incorporate counter-drone technology, and was partly inspired by the war in Ukraine spurring faster innovation in drone technology. Estonian Interior Minister Lauri Laanemets told The Baltic Times: \u2018As a venture of this scale, it\u2019s unique.

Yet despite his imperialist ambitions, he is currently being held back by the West\u2019s continued support for Ukraine, which has been stronger than anticipated. He added: \u2018What the West is doing together to support Ukraine shows him that in the event of an attack on Nato, the Western response would be even greater.\u2019 Recent weeks have seen a number of European countries issue warnings about Putin\u2019s increased aggression as NATO members have begun making preparations for the next phase of the war.

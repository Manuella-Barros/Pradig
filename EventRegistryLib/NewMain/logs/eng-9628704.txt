What charges are Angelina facing and what happened during the alleged incident?\n\nAngelina is facing several charges including simple assault, criminal mischief, obstructing the administration of law and resisting arrest, according to a municipal summons issued on June 2, 2024, and obtained by TMZ.\n\nIt's not currently known what Angelina did to be hit with the charges, as the summons did not contain specific information due to confidentiality reasons.\n\nFreehold Township Police Department officers told TMZ that they are not able to discuss exactly what happened due legal exemptions for publicly releasing information related to domestic violence cases, as well as criminal investigations.\n\nPage Six reported that her fianc\u00e9, Vinny Tortorella, was present for the incident. However, it's not currently known if he was involved.\n\nAngelina has not publicly addressed the charges. However, her lawyer, James Leonard, shared insight into the situation on June 5, 2024.\n\n\"This is nothing more than a very minor incident that was exacerbated by an adverse reaction to prescribed over-the-counter medication,\" he told TMZ. \"We look forward to resolving this matter favorably and putting it behind us. Angelina is home resting and has no further comment at this time.\"\n\nLeonard then stated that the situation wasn't that serious because Angelina was only charged on a municipal summons. However, he declined the outlet's request to elaborate on what exactly happened.\n\nAngelina is scheduled to appear in court in July 2024.\n\nThe June 2024 incident is not the first time Angelina has had a run-in with the law.\n\nCops were previously called to her home in November 2023 after she and Vinny got into a domestic altercation. While the police report stated that Angelina called 911, she declined to press charges once authorities arrived at her home.\n\n\"This matter is now closed,\" Leonard told Page Six after the MTV personality decided not to press charges. \"Moving forward, Angelina would ask for privacy as it pertains to her personal life.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Vinny's lawyer, Elizabeth Rozin-Golinder, explained the couple continued living together after the altercation. \"My client and Ms. Pivarnick are still engaged and are still residing together. Mr. Tortorella denies any act of impropriety that would warrant police involvement and denies any act of domestic violence occurred,\" she said at the time.", "source": {"uri": "intouchweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "In Touch Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katherine_schaffstall@intouchweekly.com", "name": "Katherine Schaffstall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Pivarnick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Pivarnick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_Shore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jersey Shore"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mischief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mischief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resisting_arrest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Resisting arrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freehold_Township,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freehold Township, New Jersey"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Confidentiality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over-the-counter drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/angelina-pivarnick-charges.jpg?crop=0px%2C263px%2C3596px%2C1890px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628704", "eventUri": "eng-9628704", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Angelina is home resting and has no further comment at this time.\"\n\nAngelina's NJ home, which has been featured on Jersey Shore, has had multiple visits from the Freehold Township PD in the past.\n\nThe U.S. Sun previously revealed that a dispute between her and her fianc\u00e9 led to cops being called to their mansion in the early hours of November 1, 2023.\n\nAccording to a police call log obtained by The U.S. Sun, cops arrived at Angelina and Vinny's home at 1:31 am, presumably after celebrating Halloween.\n\nCops reported the call to be a \"domestic\" incident with no further details. The report was closed and no charges were filed at the time.\n\nWhen asked for more information, the Freehold Township Police Department told The U.S. Sun in response, \"This event rises to the level of a criminal investigatory record and is exempt from release under [Open Public Records Act].\n\n\"All records maintained pursuant to this act shall be confidential and shall not be made available to any individual or institution except as provided by law.\"\n\nPrior to the November incident, the last domestic dispute that was reported to police was on July 30, 2023, at 5am after Angelina called police following an alleged altercation between her and Vinny.\n\nVinny's attorney, Elizabeth Rozin-Golinder, told Page Six at the time: \"Mr. Tortorella denies any act of impropriety that would warrant police involvement and denies any act of domestic violence occurred.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Angelina's attorney said: \"After speaking with the officers, Angelina decided not to file charges.\n\n\"This matter is now closed.

However, this will not be the first time the police have been involved in the star's life.\n\nKnown for her fiery personality and tumultuous relationships, Angelina Pivarnick previously called the authorities on her fianc\u00e9 Vinny Tortorella.\n\nThe reality TV star is embroiled in legal troubles following an incident over the weekend. Pivarnick is confronting a range of charges in New Jersey, including simple assault, criminal mischief, obstructing the administration of law, and resisting arrest.\n\nThese charges stem from a municipal summons issued on Sunday. Pivarnick's attorney argues that the situation has been exaggerated, echoing police statements that the details of the incident at the 37-year-old's home remain confidential.\n\nThe summons obtained by TMZ also provided little additional information, citing confidentiality for the lack of further details. Despite the limited information, Pivarnick will face these charges, with a court date set for July.\n\nAttempts to uncover the specifics of the incident involving Pivarnick were reportedly met with silence from the Freehold Township Police.\n\nTMZ noted that the authorities cited legal exemptions related to domestic violence cases and ongoing criminal investigations as reasons for withholding information. However, James Leonard, Pivarnick's attorney, provided some insight, stating:\n\n\"This is nothing more than a very minor incident that was exacerbated by an adverse reaction to prescribed over-the-counter medication. We look forward to resolving this matter favorably and putting it behind us. Angelina is home resting and has no further comment at this time.\"\n\nLeonard further noted that the municipal summons implied the incident is not particularly severe, though he declined to provide additional details.\n\nWhile there is no evidence that Pivarnick's fianc\u00e9, Vinny Tortorella, was involved in her recent legal troubles, their tumultuous past adds complexity to the situation.\n\nThe Blast shared last August that Pivarnick reportedly called the police on Tortorella just months after their engagement, which was prominently featured on \"Jersey Shore: Family Vacation.\"\n\nThe police report obtained by Page Six stated that Pivarnick contacted 911 to report an alleged domestic violence incident. But the TV personality decided against pressing charges when authorities arrived. This resulted in a \"criminal investigatory record\" being created.\n\nWhile Pivarnick's attorney, James Leonard Jr., confirmed the incident, stating that it had been resolved he also asked for privacy for the \"Couples Therapy\" star. In his statement, Leonard shared:\n\n\"I can confirm that Angelina did in fact call the police to her home. After speaking with the officers, Angelina decided not to file charges. This matter is now closed. Moving forward, Angelina would ask for privacy as it pertains to her personal life.\"\n\nTortorella's attorney also addressed the matter, affirming that the couple were still engaged and living together. He denied any wrongdoing on Tortorella's part, stating:\n\n\"My client and Ms. Pivarnick are still engaged and are still residing together. Mr. Tortorella denies any act of impropriety that would warrant police involvement and denies any act of domestic violence occurred.\"\n\nHe also emphasized that no charges were filed, \"No charges have been pressed against my client by Ms. Pivarnick or law enforcement. I ask that his privacy be respected in this regard.\"\n\nBefore Angelina Pivarnick and Vinny Tortorella's relationship hit turbulent waters, their love story had a dramatic beginning. Tortorella proposed to Pivarnick at a party she hosted to celebrate the finalization of her divorce from Chris Larangeira.\n\nThe Blast's March 2022 report noted that Pivarnick and Larangeira filed for divorce after just over two years of marriage.\n\nCourt documents filed in New Jersey revealed that Larangeira initiated the divorce on January 22, 2022. Around the same time, Pivarnick announced a social media hiatus to focus on her family.\n\nInterestingly, this new divorce filing came less than a year after Pivarnick had filed her own documents to end their marriage. That initial case was dismissed for \"lack of prosecution without prejudice\" after neither party pursued it further.\n\nIn the wake of her initial divorce filing, Pivarnick embarked on a deeply personal quest to salvage her marriage.\n\nSpeaking candidly about her determination to save their relationship, Pivarnick declared, \"I am not going to get divorced. I am going to try everything that I can in my power to save my marriage, no matter what it is.\"\n\nDescribing the tumultuous period, she admitted, \"It's been very hard. Hard is just an understatement. The whole entire thing, since the day he moved out and came back in, it's just been a whirlwind of craziness for both of us.\"\n\nPublicly aired grievances, including allegations of infidelity on both sides and Larangeira's decision to temporarily leave their home, added to the couple's challenges.", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Blast"}, "authors": [{"uri": "afouda_bamidele@theblast.com", "name": "Afouda Bamidele", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Pivarnick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Pivarnick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freehold_Township,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freehold Township, New Jersey"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_Shore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jersey Shore"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mischief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mischief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resisting_arrest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Resisting arrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confidentiality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couples_Therapy_(2012_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Couples Therapy (2012 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_Shore:_Family_Vacation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jersey Shore: Family Vacation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over-the-counter drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infidelity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infidelity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prejudice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/brand-img/123/1399x644/2024/06/06093007/Angelina-Pivarnick-scaled-e1717682127603.jpeg?", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628704", "eventUri": "eng-9628704", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4588235294117647, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Per Page Six, a \"criminal investigatory record\" was made after the incident.\n\nTortorella and Angelina got engaged last year, and an episode of MTV's Jersey Shore: Family Vacation featured the proposal and her castmates' reactions.\n\nTortorella recently appeared on Angelina's Um Hello? podcast to discuss their relationship.\n\nAngelina starred in Season 7 of MTV's Jersey Shore: Family Vacation, a spinoff based on the original Jersey Shore series. It involves her, her castmates, and their significant others traveling to various vacation spots. Tortorella appeared in multiple episodes with Angelina.\n\nDrama often ensues when the Jersey Shore cast members are together, and that has been the case with Angelina several times during the recent season.\n\nSome of her storylines have included a disappointing outcome after meeting her biological father, potential relationship issues with her fiance, and an ongoing feud with castmate Sammi \"Sweetheart\" Giancola.\n\nFans have often slammed Angelina in social media comments due to her behavior on the show. She recently fired back at a commenter asking her about her \"mental health\" on Instagram Live by telling them it was between her and her therapist, adding she wasn't \"bipolar\" or \"on drugs.\"", "source": {"uri": "monstersandcritics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Monsters and Critics"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_couden@monstersandcritics.com", "name": "Matt Couden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Pivarnick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelina Pivarnick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resisting_arrest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Resisting arrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over-the-counter drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freehold_Township,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freehold Township, New Jersey"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_Shore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jersey Shore"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mischief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mischief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Confidentiality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_Shore:_Family_Vacation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jersey Shore: Family Vacation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammi_Giancola", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sammi Giancola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feud_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feud (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bipolar disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Criminology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Criminology", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company_Loyalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company Loyalty", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/jersey-shore-angelina-pivarnick-multiple-criminal-charges-after-incident-at-new-jersey-home.jpg?fit=773%2C435&quality=20&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628704", "eventUri": "eng-9628704", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.388235294117647, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

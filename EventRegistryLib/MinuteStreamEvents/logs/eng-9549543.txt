to be the first cargo to be delivered using a US pier built to expedite supplies to the besieged enclave.\n\nContainers were being stacked on the US-flagged Sagamore, docked at the port of Larnaca, on Wednesday.\n\nSome containers going to the ship were labelled as aid from the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\"We are completing the loading of aid onto a US vessel now in Larnaca, and once the platform is in place, this part of the process (shipment) can commence,\" Konstantinos Letymbiotis, a Cyprus government spokesman, said.\n\nTheNightlyGet in front of tomorrow's news for FREE\n\nJournalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\n\nREAD NOW\n\nIt was unclear when the vessel would depart.\n\nThe Pentagon said on Tuesday that it had completed construction of the pier and was hoping to move it off the coast of Gaza later this week.\n\nHamas battled Israeli troops on the outskirts of the Gaza Strip's crowded southern city of Rafah on Wednesday as the US said it had held up a shipment of powerful bombs to Israel to prevent Palestinian civilian casualties.\n\nThe US, which aims to stave off a full Israeli invasion of Rafah, said it believes a revised Hamas ceasefire proposal may lead to a breakthrough in an impasse in negotiations, with talks resuming in Cairo on Wednesday.\n\nIsraeli tanks rolled into Gaza at the Rafah border crossing with Egypt on Tuesday, cutting off a vital aid route and the only exit to allow wounded patients to leave.\n\nA UN official said no fuel or aid had entered the Gaza Strip due to the military operation, a situation \"disastrous for the humanitarian response\" in Gaza where more than half the population is suffering catastrophic hunger.\n\nIsrael has threatened a major assault on Rafah to defeat thousands of Hamas fighters it says are holed up there.\n\nBut the city is also a refuge for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who have fled combat further north in the coastal enclave following Israel's previous evacuation orders.\n\nA senior US government official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, said last month that aid coming off the US pier will need to pass through Israeli checkpoints on land.\n\nThat is despite the aid having already been inspected by Israel in Cyprus prior to being shipped to Gaza.\n\nThe prospect of checkpoints raises questions about possible delays even after aid reaches shore.\n\nThe United Nations has long complained of obstacles to getting aid in and distributing it throughout Gaza.\n\nThe United Nations is in talks with the United States about the distribution of aid once it comes off the pier.\n\nA UN spokesperson had no update on Wednesday when asked about the status of the talks.\n\n\"We have determined a number of parameters under which the UN family is able and in a position to receive and distribute the goods,\" the UN humanitarian and reconstruction co-ordinator for Gaza Sigrid Kaag said last month.\n\n\"But there are also a number of international NGOs that are considering participating in the distribution of goods that come via the maritime corridor.\"\n\nKaag said some of the parameters being discussed included the ability of the UN to distribute aid all over Gaza and for the UN to ensure its neutrality by remaining an appropriate distance from the Israeli military, which will provide security and logistics support for the pier.\n\n\"We're hopeful that we're getting there,\" she said of the talks two weeks ago.\n\nThe UN has also been adamant that maritime access was no substitute for land deliveries, which needed to remain the focus of aid operations in Gaza.\n\nIsrael's military campaign against Hamas, in response to Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, has devastated the tiny Gaza Strip, where aid agencies warn its 2.3 million people are facing imminent famine.\n\nCyprus opened a sea corridor in March to ship aid directly to Gaza, where deliveries via land have been severely disrupted by border closures and Israel's military operations.\n\nUS-based charity World Food Kitchen used the route twice before seven of its workers were killed in an Israeli air strike on April 1.\n\nGet the

Cyprus government spokesman, said.\n\nIt was unclear when the vessel would depart.\n\nThe Pentagon said on Tuesday that it had completed construction of the pier and was hoping to move it off the coast of Gaza later this week.\n\nHamas battled Israeli troops on the outskirts of the Gaza Strip's crowded southern city of Rafah on Wednesday as the US said it had held up a shipment of powerful bombs to Israel to prevent Palestinian civilian casualties.\n\nThe US, which aims to stave off a full Israeli invasion of Rafah, said it believes a revised Hamas ceasefire proposal may lead to a breakthrough in an impasse in negotiations, with talks resuming in Cairo on Wednesday.\n\nIsraeli tanks rolled into Gaza at the Rafah border crossing with Egypt on Tuesday, cutting off a vital aid route and the only exit to allow wounded patients to leave.\n\nA UN official said no fuel or aid had entered the Gaza Strip due to the military operation, a situation \"disastrous for the humanitarian response\" in Gaza where more than half the population is suffering catastrophic hunger.\n\nIsrael has threatened a major assault on Rafah to defeat thousands of Hamas fighters it says are holed up there.\n\nBut the city is also a refuge for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who have fled combat further north in the coastal enclave following Israel's previous evacuation orders.\n\nA senior US government official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, said last month that aid coming off the US pier will need to pass through Israeli checkpoints on land.\n\nThat is despite the aid having already been inspected by Israel in Cyprus prior to being shipped to Gaza.\n\nThe prospect of checkpoints raises questions about possible delays even after aid reaches shore.\n\nThe United Nations has long complained of obstacles to getting aid in and distributing it throughout Gaza.\n\nThe United Nations is in talks with the United States about the distribution of aid once it comes off the pier.\n\nA UN spokesperson had no update on Wednesday when asked about the status of the talks.\n\n\"We have determined a number of parameters under which the UN family is able and in a position to receive and distribute the goods,\" the UN humanitarian and reconstruction co-ordinator for Gaza Sigrid Kaag said last month.\n\n\"But there are also a number of international NGOs that are considering participating in the distribution of goods that come via the maritime corridor.\"\n\nKaag said some of the parameters being discussed included the ability of the UN to distribute aid all over Gaza and for the UN to ensure its neutrality by remaining an appropriate distance from the Israeli military, which will provide security and logistics support for the pier.\n\n\"We're hopeful that we're getting there,\" she said of the talks two weeks ago.\n\nThe UN has also been adamant that maritime access was no substitute for land deliveries, which needed to remain the focus of aid operations in Gaza.\n\nIsrael's military campaign against Hamas, in response to Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, has devastated the tiny Gaza Strip, where aid agencies warn its 2.3 million people are facing imminent famine.\n\nCyprus opened a sea corridor in March to ship aid directly to Gaza, where deliveries via land have been severely disrupted by border closures and Israel's military operations.\n\nUS-based charity World Food Kitchen used the route twice before seven of its workers were killed in an Israeli air strike on April 1.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au",

U.S. officials have said the vessel will be used to offload supplies onto a floating pier built to expedite aid into the besieged enclave.

Some containers going to the ship were labeled as aid from the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\"We are completing the loading of aid onto a U.S. vessel now in Larnaca, and once the platform is in place, this part of the process (shipment) can commence,\" said Konstantinos Letymbiotis, a Greek-Cyprus government spokesperson.\n\nIt was unclear when the vessel would depart. The Pentagon said on Tuesday that it had completed construction of the pier and was hoping to move it off the coast of Gaza later this week.\n\nA senior Biden administration official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, said last month that aid coming off the U.S. pier will need to pass through Israeli checkpoints on land. That is despite the aid having already been inspected by Israel in Cyprus prior to being shipped to Gaza.\n\nThe prospect of checkpoints raises questions about possible delays even after aid reaches shore. The United Nations has long complained of obstacles to getting aid in and distributing it throughout Gaza.\n\nThe United Nations is in talks with the U.S. about the distribution of aid once it comes off the pier. A U.N. spokesperson had no update on Wednesday when asked about the status of the talks.\n\n\"We have determined a number of parameters under which the U.N. family is able and in a position to receive and distribute the goods,\" the U.N. humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza, Sigrid Kaag, said last month. \"But there are also a number of international NGOs that are considering participating in the distribution of goods that come via the maritime corridor.\"\n\nKaag said some of the parameters being discussed included effective deconfliction, the ability of the U.N. to distribute aid all over Gaza and for the U.N. to ensure its neutrality by remaining at an appropriate distance from the Israeli military, which will provide security and logistics support for the pier.\n\n\"We're hopeful that we're getting there,\" she said of the talks two weeks ago.\n\nThe United Nations has also been adamant that maritime access was no substitute for land deliveries, which needed to remain the focus of aid operations in Gaza.\n\nIsrael's attacks against Gaza have devastated the tiny Gaza Strip, where aid agencies warn its 2.3 million people are facing imminent famine.\n\nGreek Cyprus opened a sea corridor in March to ship aid directly to Gaza, where deliveries via land have been severely disrupted by border closures and Israel's military

Some containers going to the ship were labelled as aid from the United Arab Emirates. \"We are completing the loading of aid onto a U.S. vessel now in Larnaca, and once the platform is in place, this part of the process (shipment) can commence,\" said Konstantinos Letymbiotis, a Cyprus government spokesperson.\n\nIt was unclear when the vessel would depart. The Pentagon said on Tuesday that it had completed construction of the pier and was hoping to move it off the coast of Gaza later this week. A senior Biden administration official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, said last month that aid coming off the U.S. pier will need to pass through Israeli checkpoints on land. That is despite the aid having already been inspected by Israel in Cyprus prior to being shipped to Gaza.\n\nThe prospect of checkpoints raises questions about possible delays even after aid reaches shore. The United Nations has long complained of obstacles to getting aid in and distributing it throughout Gaza. The United Nations is in talks with the U.S. about the distribution of aid once it comes off the pier. A U.N. spokesperson had no update on Wednesday when asked about the status of the talks.\n\n\"We have determined a number of parameters under which the U.N. family is able and in a position to receive and distribute the goods,\" the U.N. humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza, Sigrid Kaag, said last month. \"But there are also a number of international NGOs that are considering participating in the distribution of goods that come via the maritime corridor.\" Kaag said some of the parameters being discussed included effective deconfliction, the ability of the U.N. to distribute aid all over Gaza and for the U.N. to ensure its neutrality by remaining an appropriate distance from the Israeli military, which will provide security and logistics support for the pier.\n\n\"We're hopeful that we're getting there,\" she said of the talks two weeks ago. The United Nations has also been adamant that maritime access was no substitute for land deliveries, which needed to remain the focus of aid operations in Gaza.\n\nIsrael's military campaign against Hamas, in response to Hamas's attack on Israel on Oct. 7, has devastated the tiny Gaza Strip, where aid agencies warn its 2.3 million people are facing imminent famine. Cyprus opened a sea corridor in March to ship aid directly to Gaza, where deliveries via land have been severely disrupted by border closures and Israel's military operations.\n\nU.S.-based charity World Food Kitchen used the route twice before seven of its workers were killed in an Israeli air strike on April 1.

In response, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh on Wednesday highlighted that the jetty is a \"temporary\" solution, and that \"the best way\" to transfer humanitarian aid into Gaza was through land routes.\n\nIn addition, questions had been raised over the cost of the jetty's construction, with news website Reuters having reported that the jetty had cost a total of $320 million (\u20ac298m) to build.\n\nThey had added that around 1,000 US servicepeople had been involved in its construction, most of whom are from the US Army and the US Navy.\n\nThat cost is around double that of original estimates, according to US Senator Roger Wicker.\n\nWicker, a Republican from the state of Mississippi, said \"this dangerous effort with marginal benefits will now cost the American taxpayer at least $320m to operate the pier for only 90 days.\"\n\n\"For every day this mission continues, the price tag goes up and so does the level of risk for the 1,000 deployed troops within range of Hamas' rockets,\" he said.\n\nThe jetty's potential placement has also been a cause for concern among some quarters, with British newspaper The Guardian having reported last week that the jetty's placement may be too far south to help alleviate the \"very high\" risk of famine in the northern part of Gaza.\n\nThe north of Gaza, including Gaza City, has been effectively cut off from the rest of the strip by a military road constructed by the Israeli Defence Force which connects Israel with Gaza's coast, known as the Netzarim corridor.\n\nAs such, if the jetty is placed south of the Netzarim corridor, any aid sent towards Gaza City and the rest of the north of the strip will still have to pass through an IDF checkpoint. This would arguably defeat the point of shipping the aid directly to Gaza.\n\nThe jetty's final placement is not yet publicly known, though will likely become clearer once the Sagamore arrives in Gaza.\n\nThe most recent humanitarian aid shipment from Cyprus to Gaza, aboard the ship the Jennifer, had docked at the Israeli port of Ashdod on April 28.", "source": {"uri": "cyprus-mail.com",

She expressed hope that this would happen as soon as possible so that the platform could be moved into position.\n\nShe mentioned that a lot of work is also being done at the port of Larnaca to prepare the humanitarian aid and palletise the food supplies, adding that she wanted to commend the incredible leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the port authorities, and others who worked even during the holiday weekend to ensure that the humanitarian aid and food, desperately needed in Gaza, would be delivered as soon as possible.\n\nWhen asked if the aid shipments from Cyprus via ship would be regular, the Ambassador replied that they want to utilise this route and any other available channel, whether through crossing points or the sea lane, for as long as there is a need 'to feed the hungry people.'\n\nAdditionally, the Government Spokesperson, Konstantinos Letymbiotis, stated, in response to a question about the construction of the floating platform, that it has been completed and is awaiting relocation to its designated site as soon as weather conditions permit.\n\n\"The loading of cargo onto an American ship docked in Larnaca is also nearing completion, and once the platform is in place in Gaza, this stage of the initiative can commence,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "in-cyprus.philenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "in-cyprus.philenews.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larnaca", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Larnaca"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Larnaca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sea lane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicos_Anastasiades", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicos Anastasiades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Palace,_Warsaw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidential Palace, Warsaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Mediterranean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Mediterranean"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://in-cyprus.philenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/julie-fisher-president-christodoulides.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549543", "eventUri": "eng-9549543", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

It did not say whether Israel's delegation was still there, and there was no comment from the Israeli government.\n\nThe war began with Hamas's surprise attack into southern Israel, in which it killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took another 250 hostage. The militants are still holding some 100 captives and the remains of more than 30 after most of the rest were released during a ceasefire last year.\n\nThe war has killed more than 34,800 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Israel's offensive, waged with US-supplied munitions, has caused widespread devastation and forced some 80% of Gaza's population to flee their homes.\n\nMr Biden announced the construction of the floating pier two months ago as part of efforts to ramp up humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nMajor Pete Nguyen, a Pentagon spokesman, said on Thursday that parts of the pier are still in the Israeli port of Ashdod awaiting more favourable seas before being moved into position off Gaza. He said the US vessel Sagamore, which left Cyprus, would transport aid to another ship, which is off the coast of Gaza.\n\n\"In the coming days, the US will commence an international community-backed effort to expand the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza using a floating pier,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah_Border_Crossing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafah Border Crossing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerem_Shalom_border_crossing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kerem Shalom border crossing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enclave and exclave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultranationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultranationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itamar_Ben-Gvir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Itamar Ben-Gvir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rationing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William J.

Biden told CNN that if Israel goes into Rafah, \"I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities.\"\n\n'Not supplying the weapons' to Israel: No arms if there's a major Gaza offensive, Biden says\n\nDevelopments:\n\n\u220e The U.N. General Assembly will vote Friday on a resolution that would provide more rights to Palestinians and urge the Security Council to approve full membership. The U.S. vetoed full membership last month.\n\n\u220e Israel posted a budget deficit of $3.1 billion in April because of higher spending on the war, the Finance Ministry said.\n\n\u220e CIA Director William Burns had returned from Jerusalem to Cairo and resumed meetings Thursday with mediators trying to secure a cease-fire, multiple Egyptian security sources said.\n\nIreland, Spain could recognize a Palestinian state soon\n\nFour European nations are in talks aimed at recognizing the Palestinian state simoultaneously as soon as May 21, multiple media reports revealed Thursday. Ireland Prime Minister Simon Harris told Ireland's RTE on Thursday that he and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez have a \"clear plan\" for recognizing the state of Palestine but are not willing to reveal a date yet. The Spanish newspaper El Pais reported that Spain could join Ireland, Slovenia and Malta in announcing formal recognition of Palestine on May 21 to lessen the political impact of the decision. Campaigning for election to the European Parliament begins next month.\n\n\"There is never a wrong time to do the right thing and the right thing to do right now is to recognize the State of Palestine,\" Harris told RTE. The two-state solution is the only way to achieve peace and stability in the region, Sanchez said earlier this week.\n\nIsrael has said recognition would reward Hamas for leading the Oct. 7 assault on Israeli civilians that killed almost 1,200 people and ignited the war that the Gaza Health Ministry says has killed almost 35,000 Palestinians. Most of western Europe has not recognized a Palestinian state, but eight members of the European Union have: Bulgaria, Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary, Cyprus and Sweden.\n\nFirst aid ship sets sail for US built pier\n\nA ship carrying aid to a pier built by the United States off Gaza set sail Thursday from Cyprus, Cypriot officials said.

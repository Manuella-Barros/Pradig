Mahomes, the 10th overall pick from Texas Tech, was 10 of 14 for 88 yards with touchdowns of 1 and 7 yards .\n\n\"Of course I always love a touchdown throw,\" Mahomes said. \"That's the big thing, getting the ball in the end zone. I just tried to go in there and do what Alex was doing.\"\n\nThe Chiefs scored on each of their first five possessions for a 30-9 lead. Smith was 8 of 9 for 83 yards with a TD , and Tyler Bray threw an 18-yard touchdown on his first play.\n\n\"Patrick had some nice plays, and Tyler had a nice shot right at the beginning,\" coach Andy Reid said.\n\nKansas City piled up 410 yards, including 228 rushing. Charcandrick West ran for 113 yards on only seven carries.\n\nThe Bengals had to settle for a pair of field goals during Andy Dalton's three possessions. He was 7 of 13 for 98 yards with one sack.\n\n\"We moved the ball really well,\" Dalton said. \"We have to make a play when we're down there.\"\n\nCincinnati's kicking competition remained all even. Randy Bullock and Jake Elliott have made all of their attempts in two games. Bullock connected from 47 and 26 yards on Saturday, while Elliott was good from 32 and 39 yards.\n\nROOKIE WATCH\n\nChiefs: Third-round pick Kareem Hunt got a chance to show his versatility in his home state. He was limited to one carry and one catch in the preseason opener. On Saturday, he was the featured running back on the first two drives. Hunt had 8 carries for 40 yards and 3 catches for 23 yards.\n\nHunt is Toledo's all-time leading rusher and had a lot of family and friends at Paul Brown Stadium.\n\n\"Honestly it kind of felt like a homecoming for me,\" he said. \"It meant a great deal to come here and play the way I did.\"\n\nBengals: Top draft pick John Ross was held out of a second straight preseason game as he recovers from shoulder surgery. He was cleared to fully practice on Monday. ... Second-round pick Joe Mixon carried five times for 13 yards.\n\nONE WAY TO LOOK AT IT\n\nThe Chiefs had scoring drives of 80, 46, 75, 80 and 18 yards on their first five drives, but Bengals coach Marvin Lewis said it wasn't necessarily all bad for the defense.\n\n\"That's good for those guys to have to play that way,\" Lewis said. \"If we go in there and stop them too early and they think they should come out, and they don't have their wind and aren't ready for the regular season.\"\n\nINJURIES\n\nChiefs: TE Travis Kelce missed the preseason opener with a sore knee but practiced during the week and had one catch for 26 yards. S Eric Berry was sidelined again with a heel injury.\n\nBengals: S Shawn Williams hurt his right elbow in the second quarter and was taken off the field on a cart. ...

Sam Ficken, signed to fill in while he heals, made a 23-yard field goal, but was wide right on one of his extra-point attempts.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Chiefs play at Seattle on Friday.

Mahomes, the 10th overall pick from Texas Tech, was 10 of 14 for 88 yards with touchdowns of 1 and 7 yards .\n\n\"Of course I always love a touchdown throw,\" Mahomes said. \"That's the big thing, getting the ball in the end zone. I just tried to go in there and do what Alex was doing.\"\n\nSponsored Content: How is your agency managing and maximizing its data? Share your opinions in a Federal News Radio survey.\n\nThe Chiefs scored on each of their first five possessions for a 30-9 lead. Smith was 8 of 9 for 83 yards with a TD , and Tyler Bray threw an 18-yard touchdown on his first play.\n\n\"Patrick had some nice plays, and Tyler had a nice shot right at the beginning,\" coach Andy Reid said.\n\nKansas City piled up 410 yards, including 228 rushing. Charcandrick West ran for 113 yards on only seven carries.\n\nThe Bengals had to settle for a pair of field goals during Andy Dalton's three possessions. He was 7 of 13 for 98 yards with one sack.\n\n\"We moved the ball really well,\" Dalton said. \"We have to make a play when we're down there.\"\n\nCincinnati's kicking competition remained all even. Randy Bullock and Jake Elliott have made all of their attempts in two games. Bullock connected from 47 and 26 yards on Saturday, while Elliott was good from 32 and 39 yards.\n\nPostal Service may be able to raise price of stamps this fall\n\nROOKIE WATCH\n\nChiefs: Third-round pick Kareem Hunt got a chance to show his versatility in his home state. He was limited to one carry and one catch in the preseason opener. On Saturday, he was the featured running back on the first two drives. Hunt had 8 carries for 40 yards and 3 catches for 23 yards.\n\nHunt is Toledo's all-time leading rusher and had a lot of family and friends at Paul Brown Stadium.\n\n\"Honestly it kind of felt like a homecoming for me,\" he said. \"It meant a great deal to come here and play the way I did.\"\n\nBengals: Top draft pick John Ross was held out of a second straight preseason game as he recovers from shoulder surgery. He was cleared to fully practice on Monday. ... Second-round pick Joe Mixon carried five times for 13 yards.\n\nONE WAY TO LOOK AT IT\n\nThe Chiefs had scoring drives of 80, 46, 75, 80 and 18 yards on their first five drives, but Bengals coach Marvin Lewis said it wasn't necessarily all bad for the defense.\n\n\"That's good for those guys to have to play that way,\" Lewis said. \"If we go in there and stop them too early and they think they should come out, and they don't have their wind and aren't ready for the regular season.\"\n\nINJURIES\n\nChiefs: TE Travis Kelce missed the preseason opener with a sore knee but practiced during the week and had one catch for 26 yards. S Eric Berry was sidelined again with a heel injury.\n\nBengals: S Shawn Williams hurt his right elbow in the second quarter and was taken off the field on a cart. ... RB Giovani Bernard sat out a second straight preseason game as he recovers from a torn ACL.\n\nTAKE THAT\n\nBengals LB Vontaze Burfict leveled RB Anthony Sherman with a high hit to the chest on a passing play in the first quarter.\n\nNOTHING BUT NET\n\nChiefs TE Demetrius Harris had a pair of touchdown catches. After the second one, he celebrated by stopping as if he were at the free-throw line and shooting the ball toward the sideline.\n\nSTILL KICKING\n\nChiefs kicker Cairo Santos was out again with a groin injury. Sam Ficken, signed to fill in while he heals, made a 23-yard field goal, but was wide right on one of his extra-point attempts.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Chiefs play at Seattle on Friday. The Bengals play at Washington next Sunday.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:12:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim":

Only the rest of the preseason will tell.\n\n\"Joe did a very good job of what we asked him to do,\" said running backs coach Kyle Caskey. \"[We kept] putting him in situations where he can pick up blitzes or run plays where we knew he needed to get a read against certain things ...\n\n\"He wasn't in there as long as probably he wanted to be, but we'll get him in there more as preseason goes.\"\n\nDoes Giovani Bernard play at all?\n\nThe Bengals are getting healthy after John Ross and George Iloka returned to practice last week, but they shouldn't expect to see playing time yet. Iloka is only doing individual drills and Ross just got medically cleared.\n\nBernard is a different story. He's been at practice since Day 1, but the team has taken it easy with him. They finally started letting him do some goal-line work, which is the only period in camp that they do 'live' tackling. At some point, they're going to have to completely test out his repaired knee. That probably either happens on Saturday or against the Redskins in the third preseason game.\n\nWhat should they do with Michael Johnson and Jordan Willis?\n\nJohnson has been with the Bengals for seven out of his eight years in the NFL. But in last week's game, working as the defensive end in base, he looked like he had slowed down, allowing himself to get knocked over twice by the offensive tackle.\n\nDo the Bengals continue to put him in the same spot, or will they try to find another spot that could suit him better?\n\nIt's notable that coach Marvin Lewis said rookie third-rounder Jordan Willis stood out against the Buccaneers. It wouldn't be a surprise to see Willis get more time with the first-team in base defense on Saturday.\n\nIs the Andre Smith experiment over?\n\nAt the beginning of the summer, it seemed like Andre Smith, T.J. Johnson and Christian Westerman were prime candidates to see a lot of playing time this season. But it still looked like a long shot for the Bengals to try to move Smith, a career tackle, to the starting guard position.\n\nFrom the start it looked like this might not work, and they might have given up on the idea thisweek. Trey Hopkins was starting at right guard during this week's practice, with Smith at backup right tackle. Hopkins, now in his fourth year, has spent most of his time with the Bengals on the practice squad or on IR, but this could be his year.\n\nSmith did not play in the first preseason game, so what they do in Saturday's game could be telling. With only a few weeks left before the regular season, they're running out of time to make a decision.\n\nDo one of the kickers separate themselves?\n\nRookie Jake Elliott had his worst day of practice on Wednesday, going 1-for-4 at distances of 45, 53, 50 and 54 yards. He was good from 50 yards, while Bullock was 4-for-4. Randy Bullock made a 54-yarder and 49-yarder against the Bucs last week, and Elliott was good from 45 yards.\n\nAlthough the kicking competition was fairly even all summer, Bullock has been more consistent. However, it's going to be hard for the Bengals to part ways with Elliott, a fifth-round pick. They may just try to get him on the practice squad.\n\nWhat it will come down to is how both handle pressure situations in games. The Bengals ran a scenario in practice in which both had to make a \"game-winning kick.\" Bullock was good, but Elliott badly missed both of his tries at 54 (the first was when they called a timeout to try to ice him). His last attempt was extremely wide right.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T14:56:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7686274647712708, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374970", "time": "14:56:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374970", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "194027", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302622", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "score": 3}, {"id": "304978", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "score": 4}, {"id": "305661", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "score": 3}, {"id": "310124", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Washington Redskins"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Redskins", "score": 3}, {"id": "310749", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "score": 3}, {"id": "311350", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Placekicker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placekicker", "score": 2}, {"id": "312165", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Marvin Lewis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Lewis", "score": 2}, {"id": "312169", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Giovani Bernard"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovani_Bernard", "score": 3}, {"id": "313668", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "score": 4}, {"id": "313674", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "score": 2}, {"id": "321593", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Offensive tackle"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(American_and_Canadian_football)#Offensive_tackle", "score": 2}, {"id": "322621", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Guard (American and Canadian football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(American_and_Canadian_football)", "score": 3}, {"id": "324224", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "score": 3}, {"id": "329201", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_team", "score": 2}, {"id": "329510", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "score": 5}, {"id": "360511", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "George Iloka"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Iloka", "score": 3}, {"id": "379441", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Andre Smith (offensive tackle)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Smith_(offensive_tackle)", "score": 3}, {"id": "825074", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Randy Bullock"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Bullock", "score": 1}, {"id": "1268994", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Field goal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal", "score": 1}], "image": "http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0814%2Fr244017_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "timeCrawl": "14:56:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Preseason Game 2: Can Joe Mixon repeat last week's performance?", "originalArticle": null}

One pass was batted down at the line of scrimmage and another was dropped by A.J. Green. AJ McCarron did a good job of leading the Bengals down the field during the two-minute drill to end the first half but was picked off in the second half. He finished 8-of-15 for 93 yards.\n\nWhen it was starters vs. starters, the Bengals looked inconsistent: Nick Vigil had a good night in his second game as the Bengals' starting strongside linebacker. On the offensive side, Dalton had several sharp passes for double-digit gains, but threw two incomplete passes as the team settled for a field goal. Dalton was sacked for a 13-yard loss, but dumped off a short pass to rookie Joe Mixon on the next play that Mixon was able to turn into a 15-yard gain with some nice footwork. There was good and bad on both sides, but there's still work to do.\n\nOne reason to be concerned: The starting defense continues to give up long drives. The Bengals tried out some different blitzes, but got zero pressure the 36-yard completion from Smith to Kelce. It was a problem last season that seems to have leaked into this one. The Bengals lack of pass-rush overall could be a concern. If nobody does their part beyond Carlos Dunlap and Geno Atkins, it could be a long year for the defensive line.\n\nThat guy could start: Alex Erickson proved he was good enough to unseat Brandon Tate as kick returner last season, and he's making his case again this year as to why he should make the 53-man roster. Erickson is going to be hard to leave off the roster.\n\nHe's been the Bengals' best kickoff returner but is also showing nice moves at wide receiver. Still, with so many receivers ahead of him, the Bengals would have to make a tough decision to go light at another position in order to keep him.\n\nDefensive end Chris Smith is also making his case to make the 53-man roster. Smith has looked good in training camp and had a sack and five quarterback hits by the fourth quarter. It would be hard to leave him off, too.\n\nRookie watch: Third-round pick Jordan Willis continued to impress, one week after his good play prompted Marvin Lewis to single him out. Willis showed great burst off the edge when lined up at right defensive end in the Bengals' base 4-3 defense. Although he couldn't get the right angle to sack quarterback Patrick Mahomes, he showed that it's going to be difficult for offensive linemen to consistently hold him back.\n\nBengals are short at safety: Williams was carted off the field with a right elbow injury, leaving the Bengals down both of their starting safeties. Although George Iloka returned to practice last week, it's unknown how long Williams could be out. With Brandon Wilson still on the non-football injury list, the Bengals are down to two healthy safeties. Shaw could slide over from corner if needed.\n\nO-line looks set: Bengals offensive line coach Paul Alexander doesn't want to say it yet, but the battle for starting right guard is over. Trey Hopkins getting two consecutive starts over Andre Smith seals that. Smith was the second-team right tackle and played special teams.\n\nOn one play, when the team was lining up for a field goal, Smith was late getting to the field so a timeout had to be burned. It looks like the starting lineup, barring injuries, will be Cedric Ogbuehi, Clint Boling, Russell Bodine, Hopkins and Jake Fisher.\n\nWhat to do at kicker?: Jake Elliott didn't have a great practice last week, going 1-for-4 while Randy Bullock, who has been extremely consistent, was 4-for-4. But where it really matters is the games, and so far Bullock and Elliott are in a dead heat. Bullock was good from 26 and 47 yards, and Elliott was good from 32 and 39.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T02:45:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7450980544090271, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374970", "time": "02:45:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374970", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "302552", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "score": 2}, {"id": "304978", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "score": 4}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 3}, {"id": "309400", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "score": 3}, {"id": "309405", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Safety (American and Canadian football position)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)", "score": 2}, {"id": "310130", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "score": 2}, {"id": "310743", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "score": 4}, {"id": "310749", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "score": 3}, {"id": "312091", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Line of scrimmage"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_scrimmage", "score": 3}, {"id": "312165", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Marvin Lewis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Lewis", "score": 2}, {"id": "316239", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "score": 1}, {"id": "322621", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Guard (American and Canadian football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(American_and_Canadian_football)", "score": 1}, {"id": "333901", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "4\u20133 defense"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4\u20133_defense", "score": 2}, {"id": "360511", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "George Iloka"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Iloka", "score": 2}, {"id": "360792", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "AJ McCarron"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._McCarron", "score": 3}, {"id": "363557", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "A.

Mahomes, the 10th overall pick from Texas Tech, was 10 of 14 for 88 yards with touchdowns of 1 and 7 yards.\n\nThe Chiefs scored on each of their first five possessions for a 30-9 lead. Smith was 8 of 9 for 83 yards with a TD, and Tyler Bray threw an 18-yard touchdown on his first play.\n\nKansas City piled up 410 yards, including 228 rushing. Charcandrick West ran for 113 yards on only seven carries.\n\nThe Bengals had to settle for a pair of field goals during Andy Dalton's three possessions. He was 7 of 13 for 98 yards with one sack.\n\nCincinnati's kicking competition remained all even. Randy Bullock and Jake Elliott have made all of their attempts in two games. Bullock connected from 47 and 26 yards on Saturday, while Elliott was good from 32 and 39 yards.\n\nROOKIE WATCH\n\nChiefs: Third-round pick Kareem Hunt got a chance to show his versatility. He was limited to one carry and one catch in the preseason opener. On Saturday, he was the featured running back on the first two drives. Hunt had 8 carries for 40 yards and 3 catches for 23 yards.\n\nBengals: Top draft pick John Ross was held out of a second straight preseason game as he recovers from shoulder surgery. He was cleared to fully practice on Monday. ... Second-round pick Joe Mixon carried five times for 13 yards.\n\nINJURIES\n\nChiefs: TE Travis Kelce missed the preseason opener with a sore knee but practiced during the week and had one catch for 26 yards. S Eric Berry was sidelined again with a heel injury.\n\nBengals: S Shawn Williams hurt his right elbow in the second quarter and was taken off the field on a cart. ... RB Giovani Bernard sat out a second straight preseason game as he recovers from a torn ACL.\n\nTAKE THAT\n\nBengals LB Vontaze Burfict leveled RB Anthony Sherman with a high hit to the chest on a passing play in the first quarter.\n\nSTILL KICKING\n\nChiefs kicker Cairo Santos was out again with a groin injury. Sam Ficken, signed to fill in while he heals, made a 23-yard field goal, but was wide right on one of his extra-point attempts.\n\nFor more NFL coverage: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T02:20:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6901960968971252, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374970", "time": "02:20:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374970", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "190817", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "194027", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "199444", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302611", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "score": 5}, {"id": "302626", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Knee"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee", "score": 2}, {"id": "304978", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "score": 5}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 4}, {"id": "309400", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "score": 1}, {"id": "310743", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "score": 3}, {"id": "311350", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Placekicker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placekicker", "score": 1}, {"id": "312020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tight end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end", "score": 2}, {"id": "312169", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Giovani Bernard"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovani_Bernard", "score": 2}, {"id": "313668", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "score": 5}, {"id": "324223", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rush (gridiron football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(gridiron_football)", "score": 3}, {"id": "324224", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "score": 2}, {"id": "336937", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "score": 1}, {"id": "345702", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Alex Smith"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Smith", "score": 3}, {"id": "347826", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Tyler Bray"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Bray", "score": 3}, {"id": "379121", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Eric Berry"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Berry", "score": 2}, {"id": "379820", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Andy Dalton"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Dalton", "score": 3}, {"id": "397089", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Vontaze Burfict"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vontaze_Burfict", "score": 1}, {"id": "503198", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Anthony Sherman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Sherman", "score": 1}, {"id": "825074", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Randy Bullock"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Bullock", "score": 3}, {"id": "1268994", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Field goal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal", "score": 3}, {"id": "1274128", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "score": 2}, {"id": "1284400", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Charcandrick West"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charcandrick_West", "score": 3}], "image": "http://d1bdhkmqqz901h.cloudfront.net/1200x630/smart/http://s3.amazonaws.com/new-smedia/ce0823c67e7a4938898d1955a3487d84/eb2f7a83b2d840619e38e9600d2ce07d.jpg", "timeCrawl": "02:20:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "3 Chiefs throw TD passes in 30-12 win over Bengals", "originalArticle": null}

You can follow them on Twitter (@pauldehnerjr, @JimOwczarski), Instagram (@enqbengals) as well as Enquirer Sports on Facebook for behind the scenes and breaking news.\n\nWe spent much of this week writing about players we thought earned more playing time - more specifically, earlier playing time - in the second preseason game tomorrow.\n\nIf you play well in the late portion of the first game, coaches want to see if you can replicate the showing against the first team of the next opponent. Or if you were just a product of being among third-stringers.\n\nYou can read those stories here:\n\nTra CarsonJosh MaloneHardy NickersonLater today: Christian Westerman\n\nAnother name you could add to the list would be Jordan Willis. We didn't because we already wrote about him last week. Well, our intern-extraordinaire Alexa Philippou did. He was paired with fourth-round pick Carl Lawson in the piece.\n\nFitting, because it seems all camp Willis has been overshadowed in the headlines by Lawson despite being selected a round earlier. Well, he wasn't in the background in the opener against Tampa Bay where he not only recorded a sack and TFL, but caught the eyes of coaches for his hustle and tenacity.\n\nSkip in Skipx\n\nEmbed\n\nx\n\nShare\n\nCLOSE\n\nCincinnati Bengals coaches talk about the team's third round pick, defensive end, Jordan Willis.\n\n\"There's a guy who's going to do something exactly the way you want him to do it,\" Marvin Lewis said. \"And then, when he got to go play live football, he stood out. And that's great.\"\n\nWillis played 35 snaps in the Bucs game, sixth most on defense. He entered on the second series once the first-team line put on baseball caps. Tampa left their starters in, so he got one series against the Tampa starters. In eight plays, he was mostly a non-factor in the small sample size.\n\nThe starters should play longer for Kansas City, so more opportunity exists for Willis to show his stuff against starters.\n\nSo much of early preseason is about getting young players a taste of success to build confidence. Check that box. But to convince coaches he can impact the pass rush immediately, Willis will need to take the next step in one of the next two games.\n\nNobody will be doubting how seriously Willis takes the challenge.\n\n\"We are trying to get him to smile every once in a while,\" Lewis said with a laugh. \"He's so doggone serious (laughs). He just wants to work to get better. He has that standard answer. 'Yes sir, coach.' However he continues to grow, that's big.\"\n\nON TAP TODAY\n\nThe Bengals are off today with it being the day before a game. They host Kansas City on Saturday at 7 p.m.\n\nTWITTER QUESTION OF THE DAY\n\n@pauldehnerjr How is William Jackson doing? -- Aaron (@chokenspuh)\n\nAugust 18, 2017\n\nThanks for the question, Aaron. It's one we see quite a lot.\n\nWilliam Jackson III has shown all the playmaking ability the Bengals discussed upon drafting him in the first round last year. He's explosive to the ball and has a knack for baiting throws and grabbing picks.\n\nThe only downside for Jackson is he's still figuring the NFL out. Standard for a player in his first full season. He'll get caught taking a bad angle on a technique or out of position. It's not due to physical ability but still trying to pick up the nuances of the defense.\n\nHe can play. And he will play. He's one of the most interesting players to watch over the next two weeks. The Bengals want him to receive as many reps as possible against first-string WRs, that's why he was a starter last week. They want to learn exactly where he's at. The same for Darqueze Dennard, in that respect.\n\nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT\n\nJim on Andrew Billings and the Bengals expanding his role on Saturday.\n\nHardy Nickerson Jr., trying to make a name for himself in the shadow of his famous father.\n\nAROUND THE DIVISION\n\nSteelers: Le'Veon Bell still holding out, but owner Art Rooney II said he expects him in the facility before Week 1.\n\nRavens: Baltimore won easily at Miami, but Ryan Mallett is still terrible.\n\nBrowns: Cleveland has partnered with Canton to host the NFL Draft in 2019 or 2020. I'll answer before you ask, Mike Brown has already stated he has no plans on attempting to get the draft.\n\nBENGALS TWITTER POST OF THE DAY\n\nYou'll have a hard time finding anybody having more fun than KeiVarare Russell.

Clayton Fejedelem will get the start for Iloka.\n\nTrey Hopkins will also start at right guard, over Andre Smith.\n\nEarlier in the day, Bengals released safety Cedric Thompson with an injury settlement.\n\nIt is unlikely that rookie Carl Lawson (shoulder) plays, too, as he did not participate in any team drills or hitting during the week. The same can be said linebacker P.J. Dawson, who still had a cast on his right hand as of Thursday.

These are only three drives in an exhibition, so red flags aren't flying high, but they are approaching half mast.\n\nStorylines that followed the Bengals from 6-9-1 through the draft were the lack of pass rush and struggles in coverage by linebackers over the middle.\n\nFormer University of Cincinnati tight end Travis Kelce beat new Bengals acquisition Kevin Minter on a 36-yard reception over the middle and tight end Demetrius Harris caught a perfect pass from Alex Smith over the middle on Derron Smith for the Chiefs' touchdown.\n\nMeanwhile, neither Winston nor Smith were bothered much by pass rush in picking apart the defense. A Nick Vigil blitz - and missed tackle on the sack opportunity - led to one Smith scramble in the quick-throw offense. Last week, Winston wasn't touched.\n\nFor all the optimism surrounding third-round pick Jordan Willis, fourth-rounder Carl Lawson and the second-half terror that has been Chris Smith, little quarterback harassment came from the first team.\n\nThe Bengals defense won't be defined by these three drives, but we are learning an early lesson.\n\n\"This is kind of showing you where you are at at this point in the season,\" Vigil said. \"Obviously after what we showed tonight, there are a lot of things we have to clean up.\"\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T04:03:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1527, "date": "2017-08-19", "freq": 38, "textStart": 1520, "amb": false, "imp": true}], "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374970", "time": "04:03:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374970", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "187023", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "194027", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "304975", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "score": 5}, {"id": "304978", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "score": 5}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 3}, {"id": "310130", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "score": 5}, {"id": "310749", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "score": 3}, {"id": "312020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tight end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end", "score": 3}, {"id": "312165", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Marvin Lewis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Lewis", "score": 2}, {"id": "313668", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "score": 5}, {"id": "314202", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National Football League preseason"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_preseason", "score": 5}, {"id": "351896", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Paul Brown Stadium"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Brown_Stadium", "score": 5}, {"id": "357158", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Downtown Cincinnati"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Cincinnati", "score": 5}, {"id": "360792", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "AJ McCarron"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._McCarron", "score": 2}, {"id": "363557", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "A.

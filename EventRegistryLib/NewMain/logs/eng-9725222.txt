Under the agreement, Microsoft President Brad Smith will join the UAE firm's board and G42 will use Microsoft's Azure cloud for its AI applications. The deal was supported by the Biden administration, which is determined to bolster US AI leadership around the world -- and see G42 decouple from Chinese companies including Huawei Technologies Co.\n\nBut the arrangement quickly attracted scrutiny in Washington, where some officials had already grown wary of G42 over its alleged ties to blacklisted Chinese companies. The concerns range from the possibility of China accessing sensitive American technology to the risks of shipping AI to Gulf states with questionable human-rights records.\n\nOne key question is whether the US will approve shipments of cutting-edge Nvidia Corp. H100 chips for data centers in the Middle East. Officials have been slow-walking those licenses over the past several months, Bloomberg has reported, as they hash out an AI national security strategy for the Gulf.\n\nMcCaul and Moolenaar said in their letter that they've had \"numerous productive conversations\" with Microsoft about their worries. But they want to see \"significantly more robust\" national security guardrails before the US transfers any sensitive technology -- including hardware, services and research. They also called for a more formal framework around the export of chips and AI model weights.\n\nIn addition to the risks of hardware shipments, some Pentagon officials are also skeptical that G42 will fully decouple from China, a key promise that paved the way for the Microsoft partnership. A new Abu Dhabi investment vehicle called Lunate is taking over management of what was G42's 42XFund, an entity with stakes in units of Chinese tech giants such as ByteDance Ltd. Lunate, like G42, is part of a business empire overseen by United Arab Emirates National Security Adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

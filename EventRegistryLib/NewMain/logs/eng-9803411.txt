While there's some progress, challenges persist", "body": "Michael Brown's death was the catalyst for massive change starting in Ferguson, Missouri\n\nFERGUSON, Mo. (AP) -- Michael Brown once told his father the \"world is going to know my name,\" words Michael Brown Sr. still takes to heart.\n\nFriday marks 10 years since the 18-year-old was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, turning the St. Louis suburb into the focal point of the national reckoning with the historically tense relationship between U.S. law enforcement and Black people.\n\nThe elder Brown now devotes his time to the Michael Brown Sr. Chosen for Change Organization, a foundation that helps fathers, mothers and children come to grips with tragedy in their lives. It's a legacy he feels obligated to pass on under the name he shares with his son.\n\n\"He was going to shake the world,\" Brown said of his son. \"So, I guess that's what we're doing. He's still doing the work from the grave.\"\n\nBrown's death catalyzed massive change in Ferguson. In 2014, every city leader was white in the majority-Black city. Today, the mayor, police chief, city attorney and other leaders are Black. The mostly-white police force of a decade ago now has more officers that are Black than white.\n\nThe municipal court system that once brought in millions of dollars in fines and fees, often for relatively minor traffic offenses -- paid mostly by poor residents -- now collects only a fraction of that.\n\nBut problems persist. The current and former mayor acknowledge that race still divides the community of 18,000 residents. Some are concerned that police, wary of criticism, aren't enforcing traffic laws, since serious and sometimes fatal wrecks are common.\n\nWhat happened on Aug. 9, 2014\n\nMichael Brown and a friend were walking along Canfield Drive when Officer Darren Wilson drove up and told them to get on the sidewalk. A fight ensued and fearing for his life, the teenager ran.\n\nThough Brown was unarmed, Wilson described Brown as menacing at 6-foot-4 and claimed he came at the officer. But some nearby residents said Brown had his hands up in surrender when Wilson shot him.\n\nActivist Zaki Baruti recalled the horror and fear that other Black residents felt after Brown's death.\n\n\"There was a sense of shock, not knowing what to do,\" Baruti said.\n\nJames Knowles III, who was mayor in 2014, believes that the widespread anger about Brown's death was driven by several factors. Social media allowed information -- and sometimes misinformation -- to spread quickly, he said. Neighbors were incensed when Brown's body was left in the street for over four hours on that hot August afternoon.\n\nThe night after Brown's death, thousands of protesters marched along West Florissant Avenue, near Canfield. A QuikTrip convenience store was torched, and goods were stolen from many businesses. Months of fierce protest, at which demonstrators were tear gassed, soon thrust the city into the national spotlight.\n\nWhen St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch announced in November 2014 that Wilson would not be charged, protests erupted again.\n\nWhat changed in Ferguson\n\nIn 2015, an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice also found no grounds to prosecute Wilson. But the report gave a scathing indictment of the police department -- raising significant concerns about how officers treated Black residents, and about a court system that created a cycle of debt for many residents. A year later, the city agreed to a federal consent decree requiring sweeping changes. The decree is still ongoing.\n\nMissouri lawmakers stepped in, too. In 2016, legislators passed a law limiting the amount of revenue that municipal courts could collect from fines.\n\nIn 2013, Ferguson collected $2 million in court fines and fees, according to data from ArchCity Defenders, a St. Louis-based civil rights law firm. In 2023, the city collected about $97,000 -- a decline of more than 95%.\n\n'A new look' for policing\n\nTroy Doyle was a veteran St. Louis County police officer who worked in Ferguson during the 2014 protests. Nearly a decade later in April 2023, Doyle, who is Black, was hired as Ferguson's chief -- the latest of several hires since Tom Jackson resigned in 2015, following the Justice Department report.\n\nBack in 2014, Ferguson had roughly 50 white officers, but just three Black officers. Today, 22 of Ferguson's 41 officers are Black. Only four officers who were on staff in 2014 remain. Officers today are trained on implicit bias, de-escalation and community relationship building.\n\nDoyle said he has worked hard to change the mindset of officers who might be resistant to the court-imposed requirements. He even replaced uniforms and changed the look of patches, badges and police cars, worried that the old look was \"triggering\" for many residents.\n\n\"For some people who live in the community, every time they saw a Ferguson police officer, it brought back memories,\" Doyle said. \"I wanted to give us a new look, but part of that new look was to let people know it was a new police department.\"\n\nMichael Brown Sr. said he's noticed the change.\n\n\"It's a weight that's been lifted up off the Black community in terms of stop-and-frisk and assessing tickets,\" Brown said. \"There's a lot of things that still need to get done. Those things are not promised overnight. It's a process.\"\n\nMore jobs and a helping hand\n\nSome companies and organizations stepped in to create jobs and opportunities after the unrest in Ferguson, which brought more awareness of economic challenges in the community.\n\nCentene Corp. opened a managed care service center in Ferguson in 2016, creating about 250 jobs. But after the COVID-19 pandemic and a move to virtual work, the center closed. In April, Centene donated the $25 million building to the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis for early childhood programs, workforce assistance and other services.\n\nBob Clark, founder of the St. Louis-based construction company Clayco, in 2015 created the Construction Career Development Initiative. Since then, 175 people have been placed in jobs in the construction industry. Among them is Malik Johnson. He was a high school student who was homeless at the time of Brown's death.\n\n\"My reality was divorce. My reality was mom with breast cancer, homeless, going hungry,\" Johnson, 28, recalled. \"Not knowing what tomorrow looks like.\" Now, he's married, employed as a pipefitter and planning a family.\n\nBut challenges remain\n\nAfter serving three terms as mayor, Knowles left office in 2020 due to term limits.\n\nKnowles frequently meets for breakfast with Ella Jones, who was elected as Ferguson's first Black mayor in 2020 and reelected last year. They both acknowledge that race relations remain a struggle.\n\n\"The city is turning back,\" Jones told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. \"It really is. Everything here is along racial lines.\" The City Council has four white members and three Black members, and little gets done, she lamented.\n\nKnowles sees that, too. He also worries about public safety as many drivers -- aware police are less likely to pull them over -- flaunt traffic laws.\n\nHe also believes too much money is being spent on the consent decree -- money he believes would be better spent on fixing streets, hiring more officers and restoring crumbling parks.\n\nThe place where Black Lives Matter took off\n\nKarla Scott, communications professor and former African American Studies program director at St. Louis University, said Ferguson will survive because its residents are resilient and proud of their community, even after all it has gone through.\n\n\"But I think it will always be the sort of epicenter for many of us who can remember where we were when we heard the news, or for people who went out there to stand in solidarity, to march in solidarity, to make their voices heard,\" Scott said. \"It will always be that place where the Black Lives Matter movement really took off.\"\n\n-- --\n\nThis story is part of an AP ongoing series exploring the impact, legacy and ripple effects of what is widely called the Ferguson uprising, which sparked outcry over police violence against Black Americans and broader calls for solutions

Speakers included Fred Hampton Jr., chairman of the Black Panther Party, and Black scholar and progressive activist Cornel West.\n\n\"Justice ain't nothing but what love looks like in public,\" said West, who is running for president. \"We shall never, ever forget the joy and the love of our dear brother Michael Brown Jr.\"\n\nThe elder Brown now devotes his time to the Michael Brown Sr. Chosen for Change Organization, a foundation that helps fathers, mothers and children come to grips with tragedy in their lives. It's a legacy he feels obligated to pass on under the name he shares with his son.\n\n\"He was going to shake the world,\" Brown said of his son. \"So, I guess that's what we're doing. He's still doing the work from the grave.\"\n\nBrown's death catalyzed massive change in Ferguson. In 2014, every city leader was white in the majority-Black city. Today, the mayor, police chief, city attorney and other leaders are Black. The mostly-white police force of a decade ago now has more officers that are Black than white.\n\nThe municipal court system that once brought in millions of dollars in fines and fees, often for relatively minor traffic offenses -- paid mostly by poor residents -- now collects only a fraction of that.\n\nBut problems persist. The current and former mayor acknowledge that race still divides the community of 18,000 residents. Some are concerned that police, wary of criticism, aren't enforcing traffic laws, since serious and sometimes fatal wrecks are common.\n\nWhat happened on Aug. 9, 2014\n\nMichael Brown and a friend were walking along Canfield Drive when Officer Darren Wilson drove up and told them to get on the sidewalk. A fight ensued and fearing for his life, the teenager ran.\n\nThough Brown was unarmed, Wilson described Brown as menacing at 6-foot-4 and claimed he came at the officer. But some nearby residents said Brown had his hands up in surrender when Wilson shot him.\n\nActivist Zaki Baruti recalled the horror and fear that other Black residents felt after Brown's death.\n\n\"There was a sense of shock, not knowing what to do,\" Baruti said.\n\nJames Knowles III, who was mayor in 2014, believes that the widespread anger about Brown's death was driven by several factors. Social media allowed information -- and sometimes misinformation -- to spread quickly, he said. Neighbors were incensed when Brown's body was left in the street for over four hours on that hot August afternoon.\n\nThe night after Brown's death, thousands of protesters marched along West Florissant Avenue, near Canfield. A QuikTrip convenience store was torched, and goods were stolen from many businesses. Months of fierce protest, at which demonstrators were tear gassed, soon thrust the city into the national spotlight.\n\nWhen St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch announced in November 2014 that Wilson would not be charged, protests erupted again.\n\nWhat changed in Ferguson\n\nIn 2015, an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice also found no grounds to prosecute Wilson. But the report gave a scathing indictment of the police department -- raising significant concerns about how officers treated Black residents, and about a court system that created a cycle of debt for many residents. A year later, the city agreed to a federal consent decree requiring sweeping changes. The decree is still ongoing.\n\nMissouri lawmakers stepped in, too. In 2016, legislators passed a law limiting the amount of revenue that municipal courts could collect from fines.\n\nIn 2013, Ferguson collected $2 million in court fines and fees, according to data from ArchCity Defenders, a St. Louis-based civil rights law firm. In 2023, the city collected about $97,000 -- a decline of more than 95%.\n\n'A new look' for policing\n\nTroy Doyle was a veteran St. Louis County police officer who worked in Ferguson during the 2014 protests. Nearly a decade later in April 2023, Doyle, who is Black, was hired as Ferguson's chief -- the latest of several hires since Tom Jackson resigned in 2015, following the Justice Department report.\n\nBack in 2014, Ferguson had roughly 50 white officers, but just three Black officers. Today, 22 of Ferguson's 41 officers are Black. Only four officers who were on staff in 2014 remain. Officers today are trained on implicit bias, de-escalation and community relationship building.\n\nDoyle said he has worked hard to change the mindset of officers who might be resistant to the court-imposed requirements. He even replaced uniforms and changed the look of patches, badges and police cars, worried that the old look was \"triggering\" for many residents.\n\n\"For some people who live in the community, every time they saw a Ferguson police officer, it brought back memories,\" Doyle said. \"I wanted to give us a new look, but part of that new look was to let people know it was a new police department.\"\n\nMichael Brown Sr. said he's noticed the change.\n\n\"It's a weight that's been lifted up off the Black community in terms of stop-and-frisk and assessing tickets,\" Brown said. \"There's a lot of things that still need to get done. Those things are not promised overnight. It's a process.\"\n\nMore jobs and a helping hand\n\nSome companies and organizations stepped in to create jobs and opportunities after the unrest in Ferguson, which brought more awareness of economic challenges in the community.\n\nCentene Corp. opened a managed care service center in Ferguson in 2016, creating about 250 jobs. But after the COVID-19 pandemic and a move to virtual work, the center closed. In April, Centene donated the $25 million building to the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis for early childhood programs, workforce assistance and other services.\n\nBob Clark, founder of the St. Louis-based construction company Clayco, in 2015 created the Construction Career Development Initiative. Since then, 175 people have been placed in jobs in the construction industry. Among them is Malik Johnson. He was a high school student who was homeless at the time of Brown's death.\n\n\"My reality was divorce. My reality was mom with breast cancer, homeless, going hungry,\" Johnson, 28, recalled. \"Not knowing what tomorrow looks like.\" Now, he's married, employed as a pipefitter and planning a family.\n\nBut challenges remain\n\nAfter serving three terms as mayor, Knowles left office in 2020 due to term limits.\n\nKnowles frequently meets for breakfast with Ella Jones, who was elected as Ferguson's first Black mayor in 2020 and reelected last year. They both acknowledge that race relations remain a struggle.\n\n\"The city is turning back,\" Jones told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. \"It really is. Everything here is along racial lines.\" The City Council has four white members and three Black members, and little gets done, she lamented.\n\nKnowles sees that, too. He also worries about public safety as many drivers -- aware police are less likely to pull them over -- flaunt traffic laws.\n\nHe also believes too much money is being spent on the consent decree -- money he believes would be better spent on fixing streets, hiring more officers and restoring crumbling parks.\n\nThe place where Black Lives Matter took off\n\nKarla Scott, communications professor and former African American Studies program director at St. Louis University, said Ferguson will survive because its residents are resilient and proud of their community, even after all it has gone through.\n\n\"But I think it will always be the sort of epicenter for many of us who can remember where we were when we heard the news, or for people who went out there to stand in solidarity, to march in solidarity, to make their voices heard,\" Scott said. \"It will always be that place where the Black Lives Matter movement really took off.\"\n\nDuring Friday's memorial march in Ferguson, participants chanted the words that started it all. \"Hands Up! Don't Shoot!\" as well as \"Say His Name! Mike Brown!\"\n\nThey laid blue roses on the pavement of Canfield Drive, then yelled, \"Whose street? Our street!\" and \"We've got to fight back!\"\n\nA few carried American and other flags and signs such as, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\" Hampton, the Black Panther leader, encouraged participants to raise their arms and clench their fists to give its Black power salute.\n\n\"Differences amongst the people are reconcilable. However -- however, differences between the people and the state are irreconcilable,\" Hampton said. \"Ain't no forgiving what they did to Mike Brown Jr.\"\n\n-- --\n\nThis story is part of an AP

(AP) -- Michael Brown once told his father the \"world is going to know my name,\" words Michael Brown Sr. still takes to heart.\n\nFriday marks 10 years since the 18-year-old was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, turning the St. Louis suburb into the focal point of the national reckoning with the historically tense relationship between U.S. law enforcement and Black people.\n\nThe elder Brown now devotes his time to the Michael Brown Sr. Chosen for Change Organization, a foundation that helps fathers, mothers and children come to grips with tragedy in their lives.

It's a legacy he feels obligated to pass on under the name he shares with his son.\"He was going to shake the world,\" Brown said of his son. \"So, I guess that's what we're doing. He's still doing the work from the grave.\"Brown's death catalyzed massive change in Ferguson. In 2014, every city leader was white in the majority-Black city. Today, the mayor, police chief, city attorney and other leaders are Black. The mostly-white police force of a decade ago now has more officers that are Black than white.The municipal court system that once brought in millions of dollars in fines and fees, often for relatively minor traffic offenses -- paid mostly by poor residents -- now collects only a fraction of that.But problems persist. The current and former mayor acknowledge that race still divides the community of 18,000 residents. Some are concerned that police, wary of criticism, aren't enforcing traffic laws, since serious and sometimes fatal wrecks are common.What happened on Aug. 9, 2014Michael Brown and a friend were walking along Canfield Drive when Officer Darren Wilson drove up and told them to get on the sidewalk. A fight ensued and fearing for his life, the teenager ran.Though Brown was unarmed, Wilson described Brown as menacing at 6-foot-4 and claimed he came at the officer. But some nearby residents said Brown had his hands up in surrender when Wilson shot him.Activist Zaki Baruti recalled the horror and fear that other Black residents felt after Brown's death.\"There was a sense of shock, not knowing what to do,\" Baruti said.James Knowles III, who was mayor in 2014, believes that the widespread anger about Brown's death was driven by several factors. Social media allowed information -- and sometimes misinformation -- to spread quickly, he said. Neighbors were incensed when Brown's body was left in the street for over four hours on that hot August afternoon.The night after Brown's death, thousands of protesters marched along West Florissant Avenue, near Canfield. A QuikTrip convenience store was torched, and goods were stolen from many businesses. Months of fierce protest, at which demonstrators were tear gassed, soon thrust the city into the national spotlight.When St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch announced in November 2014 that Wilson would not be charged, protests erupted again.What changed in FergusonIn 2015, an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice also found no grounds to prosecute Wilson. But the report gave a scathing indictment of the police department -- raising significant concerns about how officers treated Black residents, and about a court system that created a cycle of debt for many residents. A year later, the city agreed to a federal consent decree requiring sweeping changes. The decree is still ongoing.Missouri lawmakers stepped in, too. In 2016, legislators passed a law limiting the amount of revenue that municipal courts could collect from fines.In 2013, Ferguson collected $2 million in court fines and fees, according to data from ArchCity Defenders, a St. Louis-based civil rights law firm. In 2023, the city collected about $97,000 -- a decline of more than 95%.'A new look' for policingTroy Doyle was a veteran St. Louis County police officer who worked in Ferguson during the 2014 protests. Nearly a decade later in April 2023, Doyle, who is Black, was hired as Ferguson's chief -- the latest of several hires since Tom Jackson resigned in 2015, following the Justice Department report.Back in 2014, Ferguson had roughly 50 white officers, but just three Black officers. Today, 22 of Ferguson's 41 officers are Black. Only four officers who were on staff in 2014 remain. Officers today are trained on implicit bias, de-escalation and community relationship building.Doyle said he has worked hard to change the mindset of officers who might be resistant to the court-imposed requirements. He even replaced uniforms and changed the look of patches, badges and police cars, worried that the old look was \"triggering\" for many residents.\"For some people who live in the community, every time they saw a Ferguson police officer, it brought back memories,\" Doyle said. \"I wanted to give us a new look, but part of that new look was to let people know it was a new police department.\"Michael Brown Sr. said he's noticed the change.\"It's a weight that's been lifted up off the Black community in terms of stop-and-frisk and assessing tickets,\" Brown said. \"There's a lot of things that still need to get done. Those things are not promised overnight. It's a process.\"More jobs and a helping handSome companies and organizations stepped in to create jobs and opportunities after the unrest in Ferguson, which brought more awareness of economic challenges in the community.Centene Corp. opened a managed care service center in Ferguson in 2016, creating about 250 jobs. But after the COVID-19 pandemic and a move to virtual work, the center closed. In April, Centene donated the $25 million building to the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis for early childhood programs, workforce assistance and other services.Bob Clark, founder of the St. Louis-based construction company Clayco, in 2015 created the Construction Career Development Initiative. Since then, 175 people have been placed in jobs in the construction industry. Among them is Malik Johnson. He was a high school student who was homeless at the time of Brown's death.\"My reality was divorce. My reality was mom with breast cancer, homeless, going hungry,\" Johnson, 28, recalled. \"Not knowing what tomorrow looks like.\" Now, he's married, employed as a pipefitter and planning a family.But challenges remainAfter serving three terms as mayor, Knowles left office in 2020 due to term limits.Knowles frequently meets for breakfast with Ella Jones, who was elected as Ferguson's first Black mayor in 2020 and reelected last year. They both acknowledge that race relations remain a struggle.\"The city is turning back,\" Jones told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. \"It really is. Everything here is along racial lines.\" The City Council has four white members and three Black members, and little gets done, she lamented.Knowles sees that, too. He also worries about public safety as many drivers -- aware police are less likely to pull them over -- flaunt traffic laws.He also believes too much money is being spent on the consent decree -- money he believes would be better spent on fixing streets, hiring more officers and restoring crumbling parks.The place where Black Lives Matter took offKarla Scott, communications professor and former African American Studies program director at St. Louis University, said Ferguson will survive because its residents are resilient and proud of their community, even after all it has gone through.\"But I think it will always be the sort of epicenter for many of us who can remember where we were when we heard the news, or for people who went out there to stand in solidarity, to march in solidarity, to make their voices heard,\" Scott said. \"It will always be that place where the Black Lives Matter movement really took off.\" -- -- This story is part of an AP ongoing series exploring the impact, legacy and ripple effects of what is widely called the Ferguson uprising, which sparked outcry over police violence against Black Americans and broader calls for solutions to entrenched racial injustices nationwide.\n\nMichael Brown once told his father the \"world is going to know my name,\" words Michael Brown Sr. still takes to heart.\n\nVideo above: In 2020 no charges for officer in Michael Brown's death\n\nFriday marks 10 years since the 18-year-old was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, turning the St. Louis suburb into the focal point of the national reckoning with the historically tense relationship between U.S. law enforcement and Black people.\n\nThe elder Brown now devotes his time to the Michael Brown Sr. Chosen for Change Organization, a foundation that helps fathers, mothers and children come to grips with tragedy in their lives.

(AP) -- Michael Brown once told his father the \"world is going to know my name,\" words Michael Brown Sr. still takes to heart.\n\nFriday marks 10 years since the 18-year-old was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, turning the St. Louis suburb into the focal point of the national reckoning with the historically tense relationship between U.S. law enforcement and Black people.\n\nActivists marked the anniversary with a march through Ferguson, with crowds of people on foot but others in cars and SUVs honking their horns. They chanted Brown's name and sang as they walked. Some of them linked arms.\n\nWhen the march reached a memorial of stuffed animals, blue roses, lillies and candles, Brown's father released butterflies from a box. Speakers included Fred Hampton Jr., chairman of the Black Panther Party, and Black scholar and progressive activist Cornel West.\n\n\"Justice ain't nothing but what love looks like in public,\" said West, who is running for president. \"We shall never, ever forget the joy and the love of our dear brother Michael Brown Jr.\"\n\nThe elder Brown now devotes his time to the Michael Brown Sr. Chosen for Change Organization, a foundation that helps fathers, mothers and children come to grips with tragedy in their lives. It's a legacy he feels obligated to pass on under the name he shares with his son.\n\n\"He was going to shake the world,\" Brown said of his son. \"So, I guess that's what we're doing. He's still doing the work from the grave.\"\n\nBrown's death catalyzed massive change in Ferguson. In 2014, every city leader was white in the majority-Black city. Today, the mayor, police chief, city attorney and other leaders are Black. The mostly-white police force of a decade ago now has more officers that are Black than white.\n\nThe municipal court system that once brought in millions of dollars in fines and fees, often for relatively minor traffic offenses - paid mostly by poor residents - now collects only a fraction of that.\n\nBut problems persist. The current and former mayor acknowledge that race still divides the community of 18,000 residents. Some are concerned that police, wary of criticism, aren't enforcing traffic laws, since serious and sometimes fatal wrecks are common.\n\nMichael Brown and a friend were walking along Canfield Drive when Officer Darren Wilson drove up and told them to get on the sidewalk. A fight ensued and fearing for his life, the teenager ran.\n\nThough Brown was unarmed, Wilson described Brown as menacing at 6-foot-4 and claimed he came at the officer. But some nearby residents said Brown had his hands up in surrender when Wilson shot him.\n\nActivist Zaki Baruti recalled the horror and fear that other Black residents felt after Brown's death.\n\n\"There was a sense of shock, not knowing what to do,\" Baruti said.\n\nJames Knowles III, who was mayor in 2014, believes that the widespread anger about Brown's death was driven by several factors. Social media allowed information - and sometimes misinformation - to spread quickly, he said. Neighbors were incensed when Brown's body was left in the street for over four hours on that hot August afternoon.\n\nThe night after Brown's death, thousands of protesters marched along West Florissant Avenue, near Canfield. A QuikTrip convenience store was torched, and goods were stolen from many businesses. Months of fierce protest, at which demonstrators were tear gassed, soon thrust the city into the national spotlight.\n\nWhen St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch announced in November 2014 that Wilson would not be charged, protests erupted again.\n\nIn 2015, an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice also found no grounds to prosecute Wilson. But the report gave a scathing indictment of the police department - raising significant concerns about how officers treated Black residents, and about a court system that created a cycle of debt for many residents. A year later, the city agreed to a federal consent decree requiring sweeping changes. The decree is still ongoing.\n\nMissouri lawmakers stepped in, too. In 2016, legislators passed a law limiting the amount of revenue that municipal courts could collect from fines.\n\nIn 2013, Ferguson collected $2 million in court fines and fees, according to data from ArchCity Defenders, a St. Louis-based civil rights law firm. In 2023, the city collected about $97,000 - a decline of more than 95%.\n\nTroy Doyle was a veteran St. Louis County police officer who worked in Ferguson during the 2014 protests. Nearly a decade later in April 2023, Doyle, who is Black, was hired as Ferguson's chief - the latest of several hires since Tom Jackson resigned in 2015, following the Justice Department report.\n\nBack in 2014, Ferguson had roughly 50 white officers, but just three Black officers. Today, 22 of Ferguson's 41 officers are Black. Only four officers who were on staff in 2014 remain. Officers today are trained on implicit bias, de-escalation and community relationship building.\n\nDoyle said he has worked hard to change the mindset of officers who might be resistant to the court-imposed requirements. He even replaced uniforms and changed the look of patches, badges and police cars, worried that the old look was \"triggering\" for many residents.\n\n\"For some people who live in the community, every time they saw a Ferguson police officer, it brought back memories,\" Doyle said. \"I wanted to give us a new look, but part of that new look was to let people know it was a new police department.\"\n\nMichael Brown Sr. said he's noticed the change.\n\n\"It's a weight that's been lifted up off the Black community in terms of stop-and-frisk and assessing tickets,\" Brown said. \"There's a lot of things that still need to get done. Those things are not promised overnight. It's a process.\"\n\nSome companies and organizations stepped in to create jobs and opportunities after the unrest in Ferguson, which brought more awareness of economic challenges in the community.\n\nCentene Corp. opened a managed care service center in Ferguson in 2016, creating about 250 jobs. But after the COVID-19 pandemic and a move to virtual work, the center closed. In April, Centene donated the $25 million building to the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis for early childhood programs, workforce assistance and other services.\n\nBob Clark, founder of the St. Louis-based construction company Clayco, in 2015 created the Construction Career Development Initiative. Since then, 175 people have been placed in jobs in the construction industry. Among them is Malik Johnson. He was a high school student who was homeless at the time of Brown's death.\n\n\"My reality was divorce. My reality was mom with breast cancer, homeless, going hungry,\" Johnson, 28, recalled. \"Not knowing what tomorrow looks like.\" Now, he's married, employed as a pipefitter and planning a family.\n\nAfter serving three terms as mayor, Knowles left office in 2020 due to term limits.\n\nKnowles frequently meets for breakfast with Ella Jones, who was elected as Ferguson's first Black mayor in 2020 and reelected last year. They both acknowledge that race relations remain a struggle.\n\n\"The city is turning back,\" Jones told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. \"It really is. Everything here is along racial lines.\" The City Council has four white members and three Black members, and little gets done, she lamented.\n\nKnowles sees that, too. He also worries about public safety as many drivers - aware police are less likely to pull them over - flaunt traffic laws.\n\nHe also believes too much money is being spent on the consent decree - money he believes would be better spent on fixing streets, hiring more officers and restoring crumbling parks.\n\nKarla Scott, communications professor and former African American Studies program director at St. Louis University, said Ferguson will survive because its residents are resilient and proud of their community, even after all it has gone through.\n\n\"But I think it will always be the sort of epicenter for many of us who can remember where we were when we heard the news, or for people who went out there to stand in solidarity, to march in solidarity, to make their voices heard,\" Scott said. \"It will always be that place where the Black Lives Matter movement really took off.\"\n\nDuring Friday's memorial march in Ferguson, participants chanted the words that started it all. \"Hands Up! Don't Shoot!\" as well as \"Say His Name! Mike Brown!\"\n\nThey laid blue roses on the pavement of Canfield Drive, then yelled, \"Whose street? Our street!\" and \"We've got to fight back!\"\n\nA few carried American and other flags and signs such as, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\" Hampton, the Black Panther leader, encouraged participants to raise their arms and clench their fists to give its Black power salute.\n\n\"Differences amongst the people are reconcilable. However - however, differences between the people and the state are irreconcilable,\" Hampton said. \"Ain't no forgiving what they did to Mike Brown Jr.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com",

While There's Some Progress, Challenges Persist", "body": "FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) -- Michael Brown once told his father the \"world is going to know my name,\" words Michael Brown Sr. still takes to heart.\n\nFriday marks 10 years since the 18-year-old was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, turning the St. Louis suburb into the focal point of the national reckoning with the historically tense relationship between U.S. law enforcement and Black people.\n\nThe elder Brown now devotes his time to the Michael Brown Sr. Chosen for Change Organization, a foundation that helps fathers, mothers and children come to grips with tragedy in their lives. It's a legacy he feels obligated to pass on under the name he shares with his son.\n\n\"He was going to shake the world,\" Brown said of his son. \"So, I guess that's what we're doing. He's still doing the work from the grave.\"\n\nBrown's death catalyzed massive change in Ferguson. In 2014, every city leader was white in the majority-Black city. Today, the mayor, police chief, city attorney and other leaders are Black. The mostly-white police force of a decade ago now has more officers that are Black than white.\n\nThe municipal court system that once brought in millions of dollars in fines and fees, often for relatively minor traffic offenses -- paid mostly by poor residents -- now collects only a fraction of that.\n\nBut problems persist. The current and former mayor acknowledge that race still divides the community of 18,000 residents. Some are concerned that police, wary of criticism, aren't enforcing traffic laws, since serious and sometimes fatal wrecks are common.\n\nWhat happened on Aug. 9, 2014\n\nMichael Brown and a friend were walking along Canfield Drive when Officer Darren Wilson drove up and told them to get on the sidewalk. A fight ensued and fearing for his life, the teenager ran.\n\nThough Brown was unarmed, Wilson described Brown as menacing at 6-foot-4 and claimed he came at the officer. But some nearby residents said Brown had his hands up in surrender when Wilson shot him.\n\nActivist Zaki Baruti recalled the horror and fear that other Black residents felt after Brown's death.\n\n\"There was a sense of shock, not knowing what to do,\" Baruti said.\n\nJames Knowles III, who was mayor in 2014, believes that the widespread anger about Brown's death was driven by several factors. Social media allowed information -- and sometimes misinformation -- to spread quickly, he said. Neighbors were incensed when Brown's body was left in the street for over four hours on that hot August afternoon.\n\nThe night after Brown's death, thousands of protesters marched along West Florissant Avenue, near Canfield. A QuikTrip convenience store was torched, and goods were stolen from many businesses. Months of fierce protest, at which demonstrators were tear gassed, soon thrust the city into the national spotlight.\n\nWhen St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch announced in November 2014 that Wilson would not be charged, protests erupted again.\n\nWhat changed in Ferguson\n\nIn 2015, an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice also found no grounds to prosecute Wilson. But the report gave a scathing indictment of the police department -- raising significant concerns about how officers treated Black residents, and about a court system that created a cycle of debt for many residents. A year later, the city agreed to a federal consent decree requiring sweeping changes. The decree is still ongoing.\n\nMissouri lawmakers stepped in, too. In 2016, legislators passed a law limiting the amount of revenue that municipal courts could collect from fines.\n\nIn 2013, Ferguson collected $2 million in court fines and fees, according to data from ArchCity Defenders, a St. Louis-based civil rights law firm. In 2023, the city collected about $97,000 -- a decline of more than 95%.\n\n'A new look' for policing\n\nTroy Doyle was a veteran St. Louis County police officer who worked in Ferguson during the 2014 protests. Nearly a decade later in April 2023, Doyle, who is Black, was hired as Ferguson's chief -- the latest of several hires since Tom Jackson resigned in 2015, following the Justice Department report.\n\nBack in 2014, Ferguson had roughly 50 white officers, but just three Black officers. Today, 22 of Ferguson's 41 officers are Black. Only four officers who were on staff in 2014 remain. Officers today are trained on implicit bias, de-escalation and community relationship building.\n\nDoyle said he has worked hard to change the mindset of officers who might be resistant to the court-imposed requirements. He even replaced uniforms and changed the look of patches, badges and police cars, worried that the old look was \"triggering\" for many residents.\n\n\"For some people who live in the community, every time they saw a Ferguson police officer, it brought back memories,\" Doyle said. \"I wanted to give us a new look, but part of that new look was to let people know it was a new police department.\"\n\nMichael Brown Sr. said he's noticed the change.\n\n\"It's a weight that's been lifted up off the Black community in terms of stop-and-frisk and assessing tickets,\" Brown said. \"There's a lot of things that still need to get done. Those things are not promised overnight. It's a process.\"\n\nMore jobs and a helping hand\n\nSome companies and organizations stepped in to create jobs and opportunities after the unrest in Ferguson, which brought more awareness of economic challenges in the community.\n\nCentene Corp. opened a managed care service center in Ferguson in 2016, creating about 250 jobs. But after the COVID-19 pandemic and a move to virtual work, the center closed. In April, Centene donated the $25 million building to the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis for early childhood programs, workforce assistance and other services.\n\nBob Clark, founder of the St. Louis-based construction company Clayco, in 2015 created the Construction Career Development Initiative. Since then, 175 people have been placed in jobs in the construction industry. Among them is Malik Johnson. He was a high school student who was homeless at the time of Brown's death.\n\n\"My reality was divorce. My reality was mom with breast cancer, homeless, going hungry,\" Johnson, 28, recalled. \"Not knowing what tomorrow looks like.\" Now, he's married, employed as a pipefitter and planning a family.\n\nBut challenges remain\n\nAfter serving three terms as mayor, Knowles left office in 2020 due to term limits.\n\nKnowles frequently meets for breakfast with Ella Jones, who was elected as Ferguson's first Black mayor in 2020 and reelected last year. They both acknowledge that race relations remain a struggle.\n\n\"The city is turning back,\" Jones told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. \"It really is. Everything here is along racial lines.\" The City Council has four white members and three Black members, and little gets done, she lamented.\n\nKnowles sees that, too. He also worries about public safety as many drivers -- aware police are less likely to pull them over -- flaunt traffic laws.\n\nHe also believes too much money is being spent on the consent decree -- money he believes would be better spent on fixing streets, hiring more officers and restoring crumbling parks.\n\nThe place where Black Lives Matter took off\n\nKarla Scott, communications professor and former African American Studies program director at St. Louis University, said Ferguson will survive because its residents are resilient and proud of their community, even after all it has gone through.\n\n\"But I think it will always be the sort of epicenter for many of us who can remember where we were when we heard the news, or for people who went out there to stand in solidarity, to march in solidarity, to make their voices heard,\" Scott said. \"It will always be that place where the Black Lives Matter movement really took off.\"\n\n-- --\n\nThis story is part of an AP ongoing series exploring the impact, legacy and ripple effects of what is widely called the Ferguson uprising, which sparked outcry over police violence against Black Americans and broader calls for solutions to entrenched racial injustices nationwide.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

He even replaced uniforms and changed the look of patches, badges and police cars, worried that the old look was \"triggering\" for many residents.\n\n\"For some people who live in the community, every time they saw a Ferguson police officer, it brought back memories,\" Doyle said. \"I wanted to give us a new look, but part of that new look was to let people know it was a new police department.\"\n\nMichael Brown Sr. said he's noticed the change.\n\n\"It's a weight that's been lifted up off the Black community in terms of stop-and-frisk and assessing tickets,\" Brown said. \"There's a lot of things that still need to get done. Those things are not promised overnight. It's a process.\"\n\nSome companies and organizations stepped in to create jobs and opportunities after the unrest in Ferguson, which brought more awareness of economic challenges in the community.\n\nCentene Corp. opened a managed care service center in Ferguson in 2016, creating about 250 jobs. But after the COVID-19 pandemic and a move to virtual work, the center closed. In April, Centene donated the $25 million building to the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis for early childhood programs, workforce assistance and other services.\n\nBob Clark, founder of the St. Louis-based construction company Clayco, in 2015 created the Construction Career Development Initiative. Since then, 175 people have been placed in jobs in the construction industry. Among them is Malik Johnson. He was a high school student who was homeless at the time of Brown's death.\n\n\"My reality was divorce. My reality was mom with breast cancer, homeless, going hungry,\" Johnson, 28, recalled. \"Not knowing what tomorrow looks like.\" Now, he's married, employed as a pipefitter and planning a family.\n\nAfter serving three terms as mayor, Knowles left office in 2020 due to term limits.\n\nKnowles frequently meets for breakfast with Ella Jones, who was elected as Ferguson's first Black mayor in 2020 and reelected last year. They both acknowledge that race relations remain a struggle.\n\n\"The city is turning back,\" Jones told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. \"It really is. Everything here is along racial lines.\" The City Council has four white members and three Black members, and little gets done, she lamented.\n\nKnowles sees that, too. He also worries about public safety as many drivers - aware police are less likely to pull them over - flaunt traffic laws.\n\nHe also believes too much money is being spent on the consent decree - money he believes would be better spent on fixing streets, hiring more officers and restoring crumbling parks.\n\nKarla Scott, communications professor and former African American Studies program director at St. Louis University, said Ferguson will survive because its residents are resilient and proud of their community, even after all it has gone through.\n\n\"But I think it will always be the sort of epicenter for many of us who can remember where we were when we heard the news, or for people who went out there to stand in solidarity, to march in solidarity, to make their voices heard,\" Scott said. \"It will always be that place where the Black Lives Matter movement really took off.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [],

While There's Some Progress, Challenges Persist - Ny Breaking News", "body": "FERGUSON, Missouri -- Michael Brown once told his father that \"the world will know my name,\" words that Michael Brown Sr. still takes to heart.\n\nFriday marks 10 years since the 18-year-old was shot dead by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouriwhich turns the suburb of St. Louis into the focal point of the national reckoning with the historically tense relationship between American law enforcement and black people.\n\nThe elder Brown now devotes his time to the Michael Brown Sr. Chosen for Change Organization, a foundation that helps fathers, mothers and children cope with tragedies in their lives. It's a legacy he feels obligated to pass on under the name he shares with his son.\n\n\"He would turn the world upside down,\" Brown said of his son. \"So I think we do. He's still doing the work from beyond the grave.\"\n\nBrown's death sparked a sea change in Ferguson. In 2014, every city leader in the majority-black city was white. Today, the mayor, police chief, city attorney and other leaders are black. The predominantly white police force of a decade ago now has more black officers than white ones.\n\nThe municipal court system that once collected millions of dollars in fines and fees, often for relatively minor traffic violations -- largely paid by poor residents -- now collects only a fraction of that amount.\n\nBut problems persist. The current and former mayors acknowledge that race still divides the community of 18,000. Some worry that police, wary of criticism, are failing to enforce traffic laws, as serious and sometimes fatal accidents are common.\n\nMichael Brown and a friend were walking down Canfield Drive when Officer Darren Wilson drove up and told them to get on the sidewalk. A fight broke out and the teen ran away in fear for his life.\n\nAlthough Brown was unarmed, Wilson described Brown as threatening at 6'3'' and claimed he charged at the officer. But some neighbors said Brown had his hands up in surrender when Wilson shot him.\n\nActivist Zaki Baruti spoke of the horror and fear felt by other black residents following Brown's death.\n\n\"There was a sense of shock because people didn't know what to do,\" Baruti said.\n\nJames Knowles III, who served as mayor in 2014, believes the widespread anger over Brown's death was fueled by several factors. Social media helped spread information -- and sometimes misinformation -- quickly, he said. Neighbors were outraged when Brown's body was left in the street for more than four hours on that hot August afternoon.\n\nThe night after Brown's death, thousands of protesters marched down West Florissant Avenue, near Canfield. A QuikTrip convenience store was set on fire and goods were stolen from many businesses. Months of violent protests, including tear gassed protesters, quickly thrust the city into the national spotlight.\n\nWhen St. Louis County District Attorney Bob McCulloch announced in November 2014 that Wilson would not be chargedprotests broke out again.\n\nIn 2015, a US Department of Justice investigation also found no grounds to prosecute WilsonBut the report contained a damning indictment of the police department, which important concerns about how officers treated black residents, and about a justice system that created a cycle of debt for many residents. A year later, the city passed a federal consent decree requiring sweeping changes. The decree remains in effect today.\n\nMissouri lawmakers also took action. In 2016, lawmakers passed a law limiting the amount of revenue municipal courts could collect from fines.\n\nIn 2013, Ferguson collected $2 million in fines and court costs, according to data from ArchCity Defenders, a civil rights law firm in St. Louis. In 2023, the city collected about $97,000 -- a drop of more than 95 percent.\n\nTroy Doyle was a veteran St. Louis County police officer who worked in Ferguson during the 2014 protests. Nearly a decade later, in April 2023, Doyle, who is Black, was hired as Ferguson's chief -- the latest of several hires since Tom Jackson stepped down in 2015following the report of the Ministry of Justice.\n\nIn 2014, Ferguson had about 50 white officers, but only three black officers. Today, 22 of Ferguson's 41 officers are black. Only four officers who were on the force in 2014 remain. Officers are now trained in implicit bias, de-escalation, and community relationship building.\n\nDoyle said he has worked hard to change the mindset of officers who might resist court-ordered requirements, even replacing uniforms and changing the look of patches, badges and police cars, concerned that the old look was \"offensive\" to many residents.\n\n\"For some people who live in the community, every time they saw a Ferguson police officer, it brought back memories,\" Doyle said. \"I wanted to give us a new look, but part of that new look was to let people know it was a new police station.\"\n\nMichael Brown Sr. said he has noticed the change.\n\n\"It's a burden that's been lifted from the black community in terms of stop-and-frisk and assessing fines,\" Brown said. \"There's still a lot of things that need to be done. Those things aren't promised overnight. It's a process.\"\n\nFollowing the unrest in Ferguson, a number of businesses and organizations stepped in to create jobs and opportunities, raising awareness of the economic challenges in the community.\n\nCentene Corp. opened a managed care service center in Ferguson in 2016, creating about 250 jobs. But after the COVID-19 pandemic and a shift to virtual work, the center closed. In April, Centene donated the $25 million building to the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis for early childhood programs, employment support and other services.\n\nBob Clark, founder of St. Louis-based construction company Clayco, founded the Construction Career Development Initiative in 2015. Since then, it has helped 175 people find construction jobs. One of them is Malik Johnson, a high school student who was homeless when Brown died.\n\n\"My reality was divorce. My reality was a mother with breast cancer, homeless, hungry,\" Johnson, 28, recalls. \"Not knowing what tomorrow holds.\" Now he's married, works as a pipe fitter and is planning a family.\n\nAfter serving three terms as mayor, Knowles resigned from office in 2020 due to the expiration of his term.\n\nKnowles meets regularly for breakfast with Ella Jones, who was elected Ferguson's first Black mayor in 2020 and re-elected last year. They both acknowledge that race relations remain a struggle.\n\n\"The city is coming back,\" Jones told the St. Louis Post-Shipping. \"That's really it.

(AP) -- Michael Brown once told his father the \"world is going to know my name,\" words Michael Brown Sr. still takes to heart.\n\nFriday marks 10 years since the 18-year-old was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, turning the St. Louis suburb into the focal point of the national reckoning with the historically tense relationship between U.S. law enforcement and Black people.\n\nThe elder Brown now devotes his time to the Michael Brown Sr. Chosen for Change Organization, a foundation that helps fathers, mothers and children come to grips with tragedy in their lives. It's a legacy he feels obligated to pass on under the name he shares with his son.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nLetter: If Biden's age was so concerning, why isn't Trump's age?

He's still doing the work from the grave.\"\n\nBrown's death catalyzed massive change in Ferguson. In 2014, every city leader was white in the majority-Black city. Today, the mayor, police chief, city attorney and other leaders are Black. The mostly-white police force of a decade ago now has more officers that are Black than white.\n\nThe municipal court system that once brought in millions of dollars in fines and fees, often for relatively minor traffic offenses -- paid mostly by poor residents -- now collects only a fraction of that.\n\nBut problems persist. The current and former mayor acknowledge that race still divides the community of 18,000 residents. Some are concerned that police, wary of criticism, aren't enforcing traffic laws, since serious and sometimes fatal wrecks are common.\n\nWhat happened on Aug. 9, 2014\n\nMichael Brown and a friend were walking along Canfield Drive when Officer Darren Wilson drove up and told them to get on the sidewalk. A fight ensued and fearing for his life, the teenager ran.\n\nThough Brown was unarmed, Wilson described Brown as menacing at 6-foot-4 and claimed he came at the officer. But some nearby residents said Brown had his hands up in surrender when Wilson shot him.\n\nActivist Zaki Baruti recalled the horror and fear that other Black residents felt after Brown's death.\n\n\"There was a sense of shock, not knowing what to do,\" Baruti said.\n\nJames Knowles III, who was mayor in 2014, believes that the widespread anger about Brown's death was driven by several factors. Social media allowed information -- and sometimes misinformation -- to spread quickly, he said. Neighbors were incensed when Brown's body was left in the street for over four hours on that hot August afternoon.\n\nThe night after Brown's death, thousands of protesters marched along West Florissant Avenue, near Canfield. A QuikTrip convenience store was torched, and goods were stolen from many businesses. Months of fierce protest, at which demonstrators were tear gassed, soon thrust the city into the national spotlight.\n\nWhen St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch announced in November 2014 that Wilson would not be charged, protests erupted again.\n\nWhat changed in Ferguson\n\nIn 2015, an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice also found no grounds to prosecute Wilson. But the report gave a scathing indictment of the police department -- raising significant concerns about how officers treated Black residents, and about a court system that created a cycle of debt for many residents. A year later, the city agreed to a federal consent decree requiring sweeping changes. The decree is still ongoing.\n\nMissouri lawmakers stepped in, too. In 2016, legislators passed a law limiting the amount of revenue that municipal courts could collect from fines.\n\nIn 2013, Ferguson collected $2 million in court fines and fees, according to data from ArchCity Defenders, a St. Louis-based civil rights law firm. In 2023, the city collected about $97,000 -- a decline of more than 95%.\n\n'A new look' for policing\n\nTroy Doyle was a veteran St. Louis County police officer who worked in Ferguson during the 2014 protests. Nearly a decade later in April 2023, Doyle, who is Black, was hired as Ferguson's chief -- the latest of several hires since Tom Jackson resigned in 2015, following the Justice Department report.\n\nBack in 2014, Ferguson had roughly 50 white officers, but just three Black officers. Today, 22 of Ferguson's 41 officers are Black. Only four officers who were on staff in 2014 remain. Officers today are trained on implicit bias, de-escalation and community relationship building.\n\nDoyle said he has worked hard to change the mindset of officers who might be resistant to the court-imposed requirements. He even replaced uniforms and changed the look of patches, badges and police cars, worried that the old look was \"triggering\" for many residents.\n\n\"For some people who live in the community, every time they saw a Ferguson police officer, it brought back memories,\" Doyle said. \"I wanted to give us a new look, but part of that new look was to let people know it was a new police department.\"\n\nMichael Brown Sr. said he's noticed the change.\n\n\"It's a weight that's been lifted up off the Black community in terms of stop-and-frisk and assessing tickets,\" Brown said. \"There's a lot of things that still need to get done. Those things are not promised overnight. It's a process.\"\n\nMore jobs and a helping hand\n\nSome companies and organizations stepped in to create jobs and opportunities after the unrest in Ferguson, which brought more awareness of economic challenges in the community.\n\nCentene Corp. opened a managed care service center in Ferguson in 2016, creating about 250 jobs. But after the COVID-19 pandemic and a move to virtual work, the center closed. In April, Centene donated the $25 million building to the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis for early childhood programs, workforce assistance and other services.\n\nBob Clark, founder of the St. Louis-based construction company Clayco, in 2015 created the Construction Career Development Initiative. Since then, 175 people have been placed in jobs in the construction industry. Among them is Malik Johnson. He was a high school student who was homeless at the time of Brown's death.\n\n\"My reality was divorce. My reality was mom with breast cancer, homeless, going hungry,\" Johnson, 28, recalled. \"Not knowing what tomorrow looks like.\" Now, he's married, employed as a pipefitter and planning a family.\n\nBut challenges remain\n\nAfter serving three terms as mayor, Knowles left office in 2020 due to term limits.\n\nKnowles frequently meets for breakfast with Ella Jones, who was elected as Ferguson's first Black mayor in 2020 and reelected last year. They both acknowledge that race relations remain a struggle.\n\n\"The city is turning back,\" Jones told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. \"It really is. Everything here is along racial lines.\" The City Council has four white members and three Black members, and little gets done, she lamented.\n\nKnowles sees that, too. He also worries about public safety as many drivers -- aware police are less likely to pull them over -- flaunt traffic laws.\n\nHe also believes too much money is being spent on the consent decree -- money he believes would be better spent on fixing streets, hiring more officers and restoring crumbling parks.\n\nThe place where Black Lives Matter took off\n\nKarla Scott, communications professor and former African American Studies program director at St. Louis University, said Ferguson will survive because its residents are resilient and proud of their community, even after all it has gone through.\n\n\"But I think it will always be the sort of epicenter for many of us who can remember where we were when we heard the news, or for people who went out there to stand in solidarity, to march in solidarity, to make their voices heard,\" Scott said. \"It will always be that place where the Black Lives Matter movement really took off.\"\n\n-- --\n\nThis story is part of an AP ongoing series exploring the impact, legacy and ripple effects of what is widely called the Ferguson uprising, which sparked outcry over police violence against Black Americans and broader calls for solutions to entrenched racial injustices nationwide.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(AP) - On Aug. 9, 2014, Michael Brown and a friend were walking in the middle of Canfield Drive, a two-lane street in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Missouri, when a police officer drove by and told them to use the sidewalk.\n\nAfter words were exchanged, the white officer confronted the 18-year-old Brown, who was Black. The situation escalated, with the officer and Brown scuffling. The officer shot and killed Brown, who was unarmed.\n\nThis story is part of an AP ongoing series exploring the impact, legacy and ripple effects of what is widely called the Ferguson uprising, which was sparked a decade ago after the fatal shooting of Brown.\n\nFriday marks the 10th anniversary of the shooting that was a pivotal moment in the national Black Lives Matter movement, and helped spur a reckoning of how Black people in Ferguson and elsewhere in the St. Louis region were treated by police and the courts.\n\nA timeline of key events that followed the shooting:\n\nAUG. 9, 2014: Brown\u00b4s bloodied body remains in the street for four hours in the summer heat. People in the neighborhood later lash out at police, saying they mistreated the body.\n\nAUG. 10, 2014: After a candlelight vigil, people protesting Brown\u00b4s death smash car windows and carry away armloads of food, alcohol and other stolen items from stores. Some protesters stand on police cars, taunting officers. A QuikTrip convenience store on West Florissant Avenue, just blocks from where Brown was shot, is ransacked and burned. Other businesses are damaged or destroyed. It\u00b4s the first of several nights of unrest. The protests help solidify the Black Lives Matter movement formed in the wake of the 2012 death of Black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida and the acquittal of the neighborhood watch volunteer who shot him.\n\nAUG. 11, 2014: The FBI opens an investigation into Brown\u00b4s death, and two men who said they saw the shooting tell reporters that Brown had his hands raised when the officer fired repeatedly. That night, police in riot gear fire tear gas and rubber bullets to try to disperse a crowd of protesters.\n\nAUG. 14, 2014: The Missouri State Highway Patrol takes control of security, relieving Ferguson and St. Louis County officers of their law enforcement authority after days of unrest. The shift in command comes after images from the protests show many officers equipped with military-style gear, including armored vehicles, body armor and assault rifles. In photos circulated online, officers are seen pointing their weapons at demonstrators.\n\nAUG. 15, 2014: Police identify the officer who shot Brown as Darren Wilson, who had been with the department since 2011. They also release surveillance video that shows Brown grabbing large amounts of cigarillos from behind the counter of the Ferguson Market and pushing a worker who confronts him as he leaves the convenience store. Police say Brown took almost $50 worth of cigarillos. The release of the video upsets protesters.\n\nAUG. 16, 2014: Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declares a state of emergency and imposes a curfew in Ferguson.\n\nAUG. 18, 2014: Nixon calls the National Guard to Ferguson to help restore order. He lifts the curfew.\n\nAUG. 20, 2014: U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder visits Ferguson to offer assurances about the investigation into Brown\u00b4s death and to meet with investigators and Brown\u00b4s family. A grand jury begins hearing evidence to determine whether Wilson should be charged.\n\nAUG. 21, 2014: Nixon orders the National Guard to withdraw from Ferguson.\n\nSEPT. 25, 2014: Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson releases a videotaped apology to Brown\u00b4s family and attempts to march in solidarity with protesters. The move backfires when Ferguson officers scuffle with demonstrators and arrest one person moments after Jackson, who is white, joins the group.\n\nNOV. 17, 2014: Nixon declares a state of emergency and activates the National Guard again ahead of a decision from a grand jury. He places Ferguson police in charge of security in Ferguson, with orders for them to work as a unified command with other departments.\n\nNOV. 18, 2014: Nixon names 16 people to the Ferguson Commission, an independent panel charged with examining race relations, failing schools and other social and economic issues. Nine of its members are Black. Seven are white.\n\nNOV. 24, 2014: St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch announces that the grand jury has decided not to indict Wilson. Protests that were passionate but peaceful earlier in the day turn violent. At least a dozen buildings and multiple police cars are burned, officers are hit by rocks and batteries, and reports of gunfire force some St. Louis-bound flights to be diverted.\n\nNOV. 29, 2014: Wilson announces his resignation from the Ferguson Police Department effective immediately.\n\nMARCH 4, 2015: The U.S. Department of Justice announces that it will not prosecute Wilson in Brown\u00b4s death but releases a scathing report that finds racial bias in the way police and courts in the community treat Black people.\n\nMARCH 11, 2015: Jackson resigns effective March 19. The police chief is the sixth employee to resign or be fired after the Justice Department report. He is replaced on an interim basis by his top commander, Lt. Col. Al Eickhoff, who is also white.\n\nMARCH 12, 2015: Two St. Louis-area police officers are shot in front of the Ferguson Police Department during a demonstration by protesters. Three days later, a 20-year-old man is charged with first-degree assault in the shootings.\n\nAPRIL 7, 2015: In Ferguson\u00b4s first municipal election since Brown\u00b4s death, two of the three City Council members elected are Black. Black people now hold three of six seats, compared with one seat prior to the election.\n\nAPRIL 23, 2015: Lawyers for Brown\u00b4s family sue the city of Ferguson, Wilson and Jackson.\n\nMAY 20, 2015: The large makeshift memorial that sat in the middle of Canfield Drive for months, in the same spot where Brown\u00b4s body had been, is cleared out on what would have been his 19th birthday, giving way to a permanent plaque installed nearby in his memory.\n\nJUNE 9, 2015: Ferguson hires a new municipal judge and interim city manager, both of them Black.\n\nJULY 10, 2015: Nixon signs into law legislation limiting cities\u00b4 ability to profit from traffic tickets and court fines, the first significant step taken by state lawmakers to address concerns raised after Brown\u00b4s death. Among other things, the law lowers the percentage of revenue most cities can collect from traffic fines and fees from 30% to 20%.\n\nJULY 22, 2015: Andre Anderson, a Black, longtime police administrator in suburban Phoenix, is introduced as Ferguson\u00b4s new interim police chief.\n\nSEPT. 14, 2015: The Ferguson Commission releases its report addressing the economic and racial factors that contributed to the unrest after Brown\u00b4s death.\n\nJAN. 27, 2016: Ferguson announces a tentative deal with the Justice Department to reform the city\u00b4s policing and municipal court. The recommended overhaul follows seven months of negotiations.\n\nFEB. 9, 2016: Ferguson\u00b4s City Council unanimously votes to revise the agreement with the Justice Department, proposing seven amendments that the mayor says were formulated after an analysis showed the deal was so expensive it could lead to the dissolution of Ferguson. The Justice Department responds by suing Ferguson.\n\nMARCH 2016: Former Miami police officer Delrish Moss, who is Black, is appointed Ferguson police chief following a nationwide search.\n\nAPRIL 19, 2016: Ferguson and the Justice Department reach an agreement that ends the lawsuit and requires sweeping reforms of the city\u00b4s police and court systems.\n\nAPRIL 4, 2017: Incumbent Mayor James Knowles III, who is white, is reelected to a third three-year term, overcoming opposition from Ella Jones, a Black city councilwoman.\n\nJUNE 20, 2017: A federal judge in St. Louis approves a wrongful-death lawsuit settlement that awards Brown\u00b4s parents $1.5 million.\n\nJULY 26, 2017: The Ferguson Community Empowerment Center opens at the site where the QuikTrip convenience store burned the day after Brown\u00b4s death. The center houses the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis, the Salvation Army and other offices.\n\nSEPT. 15, 2017: Former St. Louis city police officer Jason Stockley, who is white, is acquitted in the 2011 death of 24-year-old Anthony Lamar Smith, who was Black. Smith was suspected of making a drug transaction and killed after a car chase with police. The massive protests that follow Stockley\u00b4s acquittal are the largest in the St. Louis region since the immediate aftermath of Brown\u00b4s death.\n\nAUG. 7, 2018: In a stunning upset, Ferguson City Councilman Wesley Bell defeats 28-year incumbent McCulloch in the Democratic primary for St. Louis County prosecutor. Bell, who is Black, was unopposed in the November election and took office in January 2019. McCulloch, who is white, was seen as an old-school, law-and-order prosecutor who drew criticism for his handling of the Wilson investigation. Bell ran on a platform of reforms, saying he would work to reduce incarcerations and start a unit to investigate shootings involving officers.\n\nAPRIL 2, 2019: Brown\u00b4s mother, Lesley McSpadden, loses her bid for a Ferguson City Council seat. She finishes third in a three-way race in Ferguson\u00b4s 3rd Ward. She vows to stay active in the community.\n\nJULY 23, 2019: New Police Chief Jason Armstrong is sworn in. Counting interim chiefs, Armstrong, who is Black, becomes Ferguson\u00b4s fifth chief since Jackson resigned in 2015.\n\nJUNE 2, 2020: City Council member Ella Jones is elected mayor of Ferguson, becoming the city's first Black mayor. Knowles, the three-term incumbent, could not seek a fourth three-year term due to term limits.\n\nAUG. 4, 2020: Cori Bush, who earned notoriety for her leadership during protests in Ferguson, upsets longtime U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay in Missouri's 1st District Democratic primary. Bush went on to win easily in November 2020.\n\nAUGUST 2021: Frank McCall is promoted to police chief to replace Armstrong, who left for another job.\n\nAPRIL 2023: Ella Jones is reelected mayor, winning by 21 votes.\n\nAPRIL 2023: Troy Doyle is named police chief, replacing McCall, who resigned. Doyle spent more than three decades with the St. Louis County Police Department.\n\n___ AUG. 6, 2024: Bell, the St. Louis County prosecutor, defeats Bush in Missouri's 1st District Democratic primary. Pro-Israeli groups spent millions to unseat Bush, who had been an outspoken critic of Israel's response to the October attack by Hamas.\n\nCheck out the AP\u00b4s complete coverage of the Michael

Neighbors were incensed when Brown's body was left in the street for over four hours on that hot August afternoon.\n\nThe night after Brown's death, thousands of protesters marched along West Florissant Avenue, near Canfield.

It's a legacy he feels obligated to pass on under the name he shares with his son.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"He was going to shake the world,\" Brown said of his son. \"So, I guess that's what we're doing. He's still doing the work from the grave.\"\n\nBreaking News\n\nGet the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nBrown's death catalyzed massive change in Ferguson. In 2014, every city leader was white in the majority-Black city. Today, the mayor, police chief, city attorney and other leaders are Black. The mostly-white police force of a decade ago now has more officers that are Black than white.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe municipal court system that once brought in millions of dollars in fines and fees, often for relatively minor traffic offenses -- paid mostly by poor residents -- now collects only a fraction of that.\n\nBut problems persist. The current and former mayor acknowledge that race still divides the community of 18,000 residents. Some are concerned that police, wary of criticism, aren't enforcing traffic laws, since serious and sometimes fatal wrecks are common.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat happened on Aug. 9, 2014\n\nMichael Brown and a friend were walking along Canfield Drive when Officer Darren Wilson drove up and told them to get on the sidewalk. A fight ensued and fearing for his life, the teenager ran.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough Brown was unarmed, Wilson described Brown as menacing at 6-foot-4 and claimed he came at the officer. But some nearby residents said Brown had his hands up in surrender when Wilson shot him.\n\nActivist Zaki Baruti recalled the horror and fear that other Black residents felt after Brown's death.\n\n\"There was a sense of shock, not knowing what to do,\" Baruti said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames Knowles III, who was mayor in 2014, believes that the widespread anger about Brown's death was driven by several factors. Social media allowed information -- and sometimes misinformation -- to spread quickly, he said. Neighbors were incensed when Brown's body was left in the street for over four hours on that hot August afternoon.\n\nThe night after Brown's death, thousands of protesters marched along West Florissant Avenue, near Canfield. A QuikTrip convenience store was torched, and goods were stolen from many businesses. Months of fierce protest, at which demonstrators were tear-gassed, soon thrust the city into the national spotlight.\n\nWhen St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch announced in November 2014 that Wilson would not be charged, protests erupted again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat changed in Ferguson\n\nIn 2015, an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice also found no grounds to prosecute Wilson. But the report gave a scathing indictment of the police department -- raising significant concerns about how officers treated Black residents, and about a court system that created a cycle of debt for many residents. A year later, the city agreed to a federal consent decree requiring sweeping changes. The decree is still ongoing.\n\nMissouri lawmakers stepped in, too. In 2016, legislators passed a law limiting the amount of revenue that municipal courts could collect from fines.\n\nIn 2013, Ferguson collected $2 million in court fines and fees, according to data from ArchCity Defenders, a St. Louis-based civil rights law firm. In 2023, the city collected about $97,000 -- a decline of more than 95%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'A new look' for policing\n\nTroy Doyle was a veteran St. Louis County police officer who worked in Ferguson during the 2014 protests. Nearly a decade later in April 2023, Doyle, who is Black, was hired as Ferguson's chief -- the latest of several hires since Tom Jackson resigned in 2015, following the Justice Department report.\n\nBack in 2014, Ferguson had roughly 50 white officers, but just three Black officers. Today, 22 of Ferguson's 41 officers are Black. Only four officers who were on staff in 2014 remain. Officers today are trained on implicit bias, de-escalation and community relationship building.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoyle said he has worked hard to change the mindset of officers who might be resistant to the court-imposed requirements. He even replaced uniforms and changed the look of patches, badges and police cars, worried that the old look was \"triggering\" for many residents.\n\n\"For some people who live in the community, every time they saw a Ferguson police officer, it brought back memories,\" Doyle said. \"I wanted to give us a new look, but part of that new look was to let people know it was a new police department.\"\n\nMichael Brown Sr. said he's noticed the change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's a weight that's been lifted up off the Black community in terms of stop-and-frisk and assessing tickets,\" Brown said. \"There's a lot of things that still need to get done. Those things are not promised overnight. It's a process.\"\n\nMore jobs and a helping hand\n\nSome companies and organizations stepped in to create jobs and opportunities after the unrest in Ferguson, which brought more awareness of economic challenges in the community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCentene Corp. opened a managed care service center in Ferguson in 2016, creating about 250 jobs. But after the COVID-19 pandemic and a move to virtual work, the center closed. In April, Centene donated the $25 million building to the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis for early childhood programs, workforce assistance and other services.\n\nBob Clark, founder of the St. Louis-based construction company Clayco, in 2015 created the Construction Career Development Initiative. Since then, 175 people have been placed in jobs in the construction industry. Among them is Malik Johnson. He was a high school student who was homeless at the time of Brown's death.\n\n\"My reality was divorce. My reality was mom with breast cancer, homeless, going hungry,\" Johnson, 28, recalled. \"Not knowing what tomorrow looks like.\" Now, he's married, employed as a pipefitter and planning a family.\n\nBut challenges remain\n\nAfter serving three terms as mayor, Knowles left office in 2020 due to term limits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKnowles frequently meets for breakfast with Ella Jones, who was elected as Ferguson's first Black mayor in 2020 and reelected last year. They both acknowledge that race relations remain a struggle.\n\n\"The city is turning back,\" Jones told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. \"It really is. Everything here is along racial lines.\" The City Council has four white members and three Black members, and little gets done, she lamented.\n\nKnowles sees that, too. He also worries about public safety as many drivers -- aware police are less likely to pull them over -- flaunt traffic laws.\n\nHe also believes too much money is being spent on the consent decree -- money he believes would be better spent on fixing streets, hiring more officers and restoring crumbling parks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Lives Matter popularized\n\nKarla Scott, communications professor and former African American Studies program director at St. Louis University, said Ferguson will survive because its residents are resilient and proud of their community, even after all it has gone through.\n\n\"But I think it will always be the sort of epicenter for many of us who can remember where we were when we heard the news, or for people who went out there to stand in solidarity, to march in solidarity, to make their voices heard,\" Scott said. \"It will always be that place where the Black Lives Matter movement really took off.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis story is part of an AP ongoing series exploring the impact, legacy and ripple effects of what is widely called the Ferguson uprising, which sparked outcry over police violence against Black Americans and broader calls for solutions to entrenched racial injustices nationwide.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nView More\n\nBuilders of Hope pioneers anti-displacement tools, tax relief program in West

The situation escalated, with the officer and Brown scuffling.

People in the neighborhood later lash out at police, saying they mistreated the body.\n\nAUG. 10, 2014: After a candlelight vigil, people protesting Brown's death smash car windows and carry away armloads of food, alcohol and other stolen items from stores. Some protesters stand on police cars, taunting officers. A QuikTrip convenience store on West Florissant Avenue, just blocks from where Brown was shot, is ransacked and burned. Other businesses are damaged or destroyed. It's the first of several nights of unrest. The protests help solidify the Black Lives Matter movement formed in the wake of the 2012 death of Black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida and the acquittal of the neighborhood watch volunteer who shot him.\n\nAUG. 11, 2014: The FBI opens an investigation into Brown's death, and two men who said they saw the shooting tell reporters that Brown had his hands raised when the officer fired repeatedly. That night, police in riot gear fire tear gas and rubber bullets to try to disperse a crowd of protesters.\n\nAUG. 14, 2014: The Missouri State Highway Patrol takes control of security, relieving Ferguson and St. Louis County officers of their law enforcement authority after days of unrest. The shift in command comes after images from the protests show many officers equipped with military-style gear, including armored vehicles, body armor and assault rifles. In photos circulated online, officers are seen pointing their weapons at demonstrators.\n\nAUG. 15, 2014: Police identify the officer who shot Brown as Darren Wilson, who had been with the department since 2011. They also release surveillance video that shows Brown grabbing large amounts of cigarillos from behind the counter of the Ferguson Market and pushing a worker who confronts him as he leaves the convenience store. Police say Brown took almost $50 worth of cigarillos. The release of the video upsets protesters.\n\nAUG. 16, 2014: Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declares a state of emergency and imposes a curfew in Ferguson.\n\nAUG. 18, 2014: Nixon calls the National Guard to Ferguson to help restore order. He lifts the curfew.\n\nAUG. 20, 2014: U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder visits Ferguson to offer assurances about the investigation into Brown's death and to meet with investigators and Brown's family. A grand jury begins hearing evidence to determine whether Wilson should be charged.\n\nAUG. 21, 2014: Nixon orders the National Guard to withdraw from Ferguson.\n\nSEPT. 25, 2014: Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson releases a videotaped apology to Brown's family and attempts to march in solidarity with protesters. The move backfires when Ferguson officers scuffle with demonstrators and arrest one person moments after Jackson, who is white, joins the group.\n\nNOV. 17, 2014: Nixon declares a state of emergency and activates the National Guard again ahead of a decision from a grand jury. He places Ferguson police in charge of security in Ferguson, with orders for them to work as a unified command with other departments.\n\nNOV. 18, 2014: Nixon names 16 people to the Ferguson Commission, an independent panel charged with examining race relations, failing schools and other social and economic issues. Nine of its members are Black. Seven are white.\n\nNOV. 24, 2014: St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch announces that the grand jury has decided not to indict Wilson.

(AP) -- Michael Brown once told his father the \"world is going to know my name,\" words Michael Brown Sr. still takes to heart.\n\nFriday marks 10 years since the 18-year-old was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, turning the St. Louis suburb into the focal point of the national reckoning with the historically tense relationship between U.S. law enforcement and Black people.\n\nThe elder Brown now devotes his time to the Michael Brown Sr. Chosen for Change Organization, a foundation that helps fathers, mothers and children come to grips with tragedy in their lives. It's a legacy he feels obligated to pass on under the name he shares with his son.\n\nNelly 'targeted by overzealous' cop after winning at Maryland Heights casino, attorney says Letter: If Biden's age was so concerning, why isn't Trump's age?

He's still doing the work from the grave.\"\n\nBrown's death catalyzed massive change in Ferguson. In 2014, every city leader was white in the majority-Black city. Today, the mayor, police chief, city attorney and other leaders are Black. The mostly-white police force of a decade ago now has more officers that are Black than white.\n\nThe municipal court system that once brought in millions of dollars in fines and fees, often for relatively minor traffic offenses -- paid mostly by poor residents -- now collects only a fraction of that.\n\nBut problems persist. The current and former mayor acknowledge that race still divides the community of 18,000 residents. Some are concerned that police, wary of criticism, aren't enforcing traffic laws, since serious and sometimes fatal wrecks are common.\n\nWhat happened on Aug. 9, 2014\n\nMichael Brown and a friend were walking along Canfield Drive when Officer Darren Wilson drove up and told them to get on the sidewalk. A fight ensued and fearing for his life, the teenager ran.\n\nThough Brown was unarmed, Wilson described Brown as menacing at 6-foot-4 and claimed he came at the officer. But some nearby residents said Brown had his hands up in surrender when Wilson shot him.\n\nActivist Zaki Baruti recalled the horror and fear that other Black residents felt after Brown's death.\n\n\"There was a sense of shock, not knowing what to do,\" Baruti said.\n\nJames Knowles III, who was mayor in 2014, believes that the widespread anger about Brown's death was driven by several factors. Social media allowed information -- and sometimes misinformation -- to spread quickly, he said. Neighbors were incensed when Brown's body was left in the street for over four hours on that hot August afternoon.\n\nThe night after Brown's death, thousands of protesters marched along West Florissant Avenue, near Canfield. A QuikTrip convenience store was torched, and goods were stolen from many businesses. Months of fierce protest, at which demonstrators were tear gassed, soon thrust the city into the national spotlight.\n\nWhen St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch announced in November 2014 that Wilson would not be charged, protests erupted again.\n\nWhat changed in Ferguson\n\nIn 2015, an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice also found no grounds to prosecute Wilson. But the report gave a scathing indictment of the police department -- raising significant concerns about how officers treated Black residents, and about a court system that created a cycle of debt for many residents. A year later, the city agreed to a federal consent decree requiring sweeping changes. The decree is still ongoing.\n\nMissouri lawmakers stepped in, too. In 2016, legislators passed a law limiting the amount of revenue that municipal courts could collect from fines.\n\nIn 2013, Ferguson collected $2 million in court fines and fees, according to data from ArchCity Defenders, a St. Louis-based civil rights law firm. In 2023, the city collected about $97,000 -- a decline of more than 95%.\n\n'A new look' for policing\n\nTroy Doyle was a veteran St. Louis County police officer who worked in Ferguson during the 2014 protests. Nearly a decade later in April 2023, Doyle, who is Black, was hired as Ferguson's chief -- the latest of several hires since Tom Jackson resigned in 2015, following the Justice Department report.\n\nBack in 2014, Ferguson had roughly 50 white officers, but just three Black officers. Today, 22 of Ferguson's 41 officers are Black. Only four officers who were on staff in 2014 remain. Officers today are trained on implicit bias, de-escalation and community relationship building.\n\nDoyle said he has worked hard to change the mindset of officers who might be resistant to the court-imposed requirements. He even replaced uniforms and changed the look of patches, badges and police cars, worried that the old look was \"triggering\" for many residents.\n\n\"For some people who live in the community, every time they saw a Ferguson police officer, it brought back memories,\" Doyle said. \"I wanted to give us a new look, but part of that new look was to let people know it was a new police department.\"\n\nMichael Brown Sr. said he's noticed the change.\n\n\"It's a weight that's been lifted up off the Black community in terms of stop-and-frisk and assessing tickets,\" Brown said. \"There's a lot of things that still need to get done. Those things are not promised overnight. It's a process.\"\n\nMore jobs and a helping hand\n\nSome companies and organizations stepped in to create jobs and opportunities after the unrest in Ferguson, which brought more awareness of economic challenges in the community.\n\nCentene Corp. opened a managed care service center in Ferguson in 2016, creating about 250 jobs. But after the COVID-19 pandemic and a move to virtual work, the center closed. In April, Centene donated the $25 million building to the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis for early childhood programs, workforce assistance and other services.\n\nBob Clark, founder of the St. Louis-based construction company Clayco, in 2015 created the Construction Career Development Initiative. Since then, 175 people have been placed in jobs in the construction industry. Among them is Malik Johnson. He was a high school student who was homeless at the time of Brown's death.\n\n\"My reality was divorce. My reality was mom with breast cancer, homeless, going hungry,\" Johnson, 28, recalled. \"Not knowing what tomorrow looks like.\" Now, he's married, employed as a pipefitter and planning a family.\n\nBut challenges remain\n\nAfter serving three terms as mayor, Knowles left office in 2020 due to term limits.\n\nKnowles frequently meets for breakfast with Ella Jones, who was elected as Ferguson's first Black mayor in 2020 and reelected last year. They both acknowledge that race relations remain a struggle.\n\n\"The city is turning back,\" Jones told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. \"It really is. Everything here is along racial lines.\" The City Council has four white members and three Black members, and little gets done, she lamented.\n\nKnowles sees that, too. He also worries about public safety as many drivers -- aware police are less likely to pull them over -- flaunt traffic laws.\n\nHe also believes too much money is being spent on the consent decree -- money he believes would be better spent on fixing streets, hiring more officers and restoring crumbling parks.\n\nThe place where Black Lives Matter took off\n\nKarla Scott, communications professor and former African American Studies program director at St. Louis University, said Ferguson will survive because its residents are resilient and proud of their community, even after all it has gone through.\n\n\"But I think it will always be the sort of epicenter for many of us who can remember where we were when we heard the news, or for people who went out there to stand in solidarity, to march in solidarity, to make their voices heard,\" Scott said. \"It will always be that place where the Black Lives Matter movement really took off.\"\n\n-- --\n\nThis story is part of an AP ongoing series exploring the impact, legacy and ripple effects of what is widely called the Ferguson uprising, which sparked outcry over police violence against Black Americans and broader calls for solutions to entrenched racial injustices nationwide.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Ferguson, Missouri, when a police officer drove by and told them to use the sidewalk.\n\nAfter an exchange of words, the white officer confronted the 18-year-old Brown, who was black. The situation escalated, with the officer and Brown getting into an argument. The officer shot and killed Brown, who was unarmed.\n\nThis story is part of an ongoing AP series examining the impact, legacy and fallout of the so-called Ferguson uprising, which sparked the deadly shooting of Brown a decade ago.\n\nFriday marks the 10th anniversary of the shooting, a pivotal moment in the national Black Lives Matter movement that prompted a reflection on the treatment of black people in Ferguson and elsewhere in the St. Louis region by police and the courts.\n\n9 AUG 2014: Brown's bloodied body stays on the street four hours in the summer heat.

Other businesses are damaged or destroyed. It is the first of several nights of unrest.

(AP) -- On Aug. 9, 2014, Michael Brown and a friend were walking in the middle of Canfield Drive, a two-lane street in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Missouri, when a police officer drove by and told them to use the sidewalk.\n\nAfter words were exchanged, the white officer confronted the 18-year-old Brown, who was Black. The situation escalated, with the officer and Brown scuffling. The officer shot and killed Brown, who was unarmed.\n\nThis story is part of an AP ongoing series exploring the impact, legacy and ripple effects of what is widely called the Ferguson uprising, which was sparked a decade ago after the fatal shooting of Brown.\n\nFriday marks the 10th anniversary of the shooting that was a pivotal moment in the national Black Lives Matter movement, and helped spur a reckoning of how Black people in Ferguson and elsewhere in the St. Louis region were treated by police and the courts.\n\nA timeline of key events that followed the shooting:\n\n___\n\nAUG. 9, 2014: Brown's bloodied body remains in the street for four hours in the summer heat. People in the neighborhood later lash out at police, saying they mistreated the body.\n\n___\n\nAUG. 10, 2014: After a candlelight vigil, people protesting Brown's death smash car windows and carry away armloads of food, alcohol and other stolen items from stores. Some protesters stand on police cars, taunting officers. A QuikTrip convenience store on West Florissant Avenue, just blocks from where Brown was shot, is ransacked and burned. Other businesses are damaged or destroyed. It's the first of several nights of unrest. The protests help solidify the Black Lives Matter movement formed in the wake of the 2012 death of Black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida and the acquittal of the neighborhood watch volunteer who shot him.\n\n___\n\nAUG. 11, 2014: The FBI opens an investigation into Brown's death, and two men who said they saw the shooting tell reporters that Brown had his hands raised when the officer fired repeatedly. That night, police in riot gear fire tear gas and rubber bullets to try to disperse a crowd of protesters.\n\n___\n\nAUG. 14, 2014: The Missouri State Highway Patrol takes control of security, relieving Ferguson and St. Louis County officers of their law enforcement authority after days of unrest. The shift in command comes after images from the protests show many officers equipped with military-style gear, including armored vehicles, body armor and assault rifles. In photos circulated online, officers are seen pointing their weapons at demonstrators.\n\n___\n\nAUG. 15, 2014: Police identify the officer who shot Brown as Darren Wilson, who had been with the department since 2011. They also release surveillance video that shows Brown grabbing large amounts of cigarillos from behind the counter of the Ferguson Market and pushing a worker who confronts him as he leaves the convenience store. Police say Brown took almost $50 worth of cigarillos. The release of the video upsets protesters.\n\n___\n\nAUG. 16, 2014: Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declares a state of emergency and imposes a curfew in Ferguson.\n\n___\n\nAUG. 18, 2014: Nixon calls the National Guard to Ferguson to help restore order. He lifts the curfew.\n\n___\n\nAUG. 20, 2014: U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder visits Ferguson to offer assurances about the investigation into Brown's death and to meet with investigators and Brown's family. A grand jury begins hearing evidence to determine whether Wilson should be charged.\n\n___\n\nAUG. 21, 2014: Nixon orders the National Guard to withdraw from Ferguson.\n\n___\n\nSEPT. 25, 2014: Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson releases a videotaped apology to Brown's family and attempts to march in solidarity with protesters. The move backfires when Ferguson officers scuffle with demonstrators and arrest one person moments after Jackson, who is white, joins the group.\n\n___\n\nNOV. 17, 2014: Nixon declares a state of emergency and activates the National Guard again ahead of a decision from a grand jury. He places Ferguson police in charge of security in Ferguson, with orders for them to work as a unified command with other departments.\n\n___\n\nNOV. 18, 2014: Nixon names 16 people to the Ferguson Commission, an independent panel charged with examining race relations, failing schools and other social and economic issues. Nine of its members are Black. Seven are white.\n\n___\n\nNOV. 24, 2014: St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch announces that the grand jury has decided not to indict Wilson. Protests that were passionate but peaceful earlier in the day turn violent. At least a dozen buildings and multiple police cars are burned, officers are hit by rocks and batteries, and reports of gunfire force some St. Louis-bound flights to be diverted.\n\n___\n\nNOV. 29, 2014: Wilson announces his resignation from the Ferguson Police Department effective immediately.\n\n___\n\nMARCH 4, 2015: The U.S. Department of Justice announces that it will not prosecute Wilson in Brown's death but releases a scathing report that finds racial bias in the way police and courts in the community treat Black people.\n\n___\n\nMARCH 11, 2015: Jackson resigns effective March 19. The police chief is the sixth employee to resign or be fired after the Justice Department report. He is replaced on an interim basis by his top commander, Lt. Col. Al Eickhoff, who is also white.\n\n___\n\nMARCH 12, 2015: Two St. Louis-area police officers are shot in front of the Ferguson Police Department during a demonstration by protesters. Three days later, a 20-year-old man is charged with first-degree assault in the shootings.\n\n___\n\nAPRIL 7, 2015: In Ferguson's first municipal election since Brown's death, two of the three City Council members elected are Black. Black people now hold three of six seats, compared with one seat prior to the election.\n\n___\n\nAPRIL 23, 2015: Lawyers for Brown's family sue the city of Ferguson, Wilson and Jackson.\n\n___\n\nMAY 20, 2015: The large makeshift memorial that sat in the middle of Canfield Drive for months, in the same spot where Brown's body had been, is cleared out on what would have been his 19th birthday, giving way to a permanent plaque installed nearby in his memory.\n\n___\n\nJUNE 9, 2015: Ferguson hires a new municipal judge and interim city manager, both of them Black.\n\n___\n\nJULY 10, 2015: Nixon signs into law legislation limiting cities' ability to profit from traffic tickets and court fines, the first significant step taken by state lawmakers to address concerns raised after Brown's death. Among other things, the law lowers the percentage of revenue most cities can collect from traffic fines and fees from 30% to 20%.\n\n___\n\nJULY 22, 2015: Andre Anderson, a Black, longtime police administrator in suburban Phoenix, is introduced as Ferguson's new interim police chief.\n\n___\n\nSEPT. 14, 2015: The Ferguson Commission releases its report addressing the economic and racial factors that contributed to the unrest after Brown's death.\n\n___\n\nJAN. 27, 2016: Ferguson announces a tentative deal with the Justice Department to reform the city's policing and municipal court. The recommended overhaul follows seven months of negotiations.\n\n___\n\nFEB. 9, 2016: Ferguson's City Council unanimously votes to revise the agreement with the Justice Department, proposing seven amendments that the mayor says were formulated after an analysis showed the deal was so expensive it could lead to the dissolution of Ferguson. The Justice Department responds by suing Ferguson.\n\n___\n\nMARCH 2016: Former Miami police officer Delrish Moss, who is Black, is appointed Ferguson police chief following a nationwide search.\n\n___\n\nAPRIL 19, 2016: Ferguson and the Justice Department reach an agreement that ends the lawsuit and requires sweeping reforms of the city's police and court systems.\n\n___\n\nAPRIL 4, 2017: Incumbent Mayor James Knowles III, who is white, is reelected to a third three-year term, overcoming opposition from Ella Jones, a Black city councilwoman.\n\n___\n\nJUNE 20, 2017: A federal judge in St. Louis approves a wrongful-death lawsuit settlement that awards Brown's parents $1.5 million.\n\n___\n\nJULY 26, 2017: The Ferguson Community Empowerment Center opens at the site where the QuikTrip convenience store burned the day after Brown's death. The center houses the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis, the Salvation Army and other offices.\n\n___\n\nSEPT. 15, 2017: Former St. Louis city police officer Jason Stockley, who is white, is acquitted in the 2011 death of 24-year-old Anthony Lamar Smith, who was Black. Smith was suspected of making a drug transaction and killed after a car chase with police. The massive protests that follow Stockley's acquittal are the largest in the St. Louis region since the immediate aftermath of Brown's death.\n\n___\n\nAUG. 7, 2018: In a stunning upset, Ferguson City Councilman Wesley Bell defeats 28-year incumbent McCulloch in the Democratic primary for St. Louis County prosecutor. Bell, who is Black, was unopposed in the November election and took office in January 2019. McCulloch, who is white, was seen as an old-school, law-and-order prosecutor who drew criticism for his handling of the Wilson investigation. Bell ran on a platform of reforms, saying he would work to reduce incarcerations and start a unit to investigate shootings involving officers.\n\n___\n\nAPRIL 2, 2019: Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, loses her bid for a Ferguson City Council seat.

The situation escalated, with the officer and Brown scuffling. The officer fired and killed Brown, who was unarmed.\n\nThis tale is part of an AP continuous series delving into the impact, legacy, and repercussions of what is commonly referred to as the Ferguson uprising, which was ignited a decade ago after the fatal shooting of Brown.\n\nFriday marks the 10th anniversary of the shooting that was a pivotal moment in the national Black Lives Matter movement, and helped stimulate a reckoning of how Black individuals in Ferguson and elsewhere in the St. Louis region were treated by police and the courts.\n\nA chronology of critical incidents that ensued after the shooting:\n\n___\n\nAUG. 9, 2014: Brown's bloodied body remains in the street for four hours in the summer heat. Residents in the area later criticize the police, alleging they mistreated the body.\n\n___\n\nAUG. 10, 2014: Following a candlelight vigil, individuals protesting Brown's demise shatter car windows and haul away armfuls of food, alcohol, and other stolen items from stores. Some protestors stand on police vehicles, taunting officers. A QuikTrip convenience store on West Florissant Avenue, just blocks from where Brown was shot, is looted and set ablaze. Other businesses are vandalized or demolished. It's the initial of several nights of turmoil. The protests help cement the Black Lives Matter movement formed following the 2012 death of Black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida and the acquittal of the neighborhood watch volunteer who shot him.\n\n___\n\nAUG. 11, 2014: The FBI initiates an inquiry into Brown's death, and two men who claim they witnessed the shooting inform journalists that Brown had his hands raised when the officer discharged his weapon repeatedly. That evening, police in riot gear deploy tear gas and rubber bullets to attempt to disband a crowd of protestors.\n\n___\n\nAUG. 14, 2014: The Missouri State Highway Patrol seizes control of security, relieving Ferguson and St. Louis County officers of their law enforcement authority after days of unrest. The change in command comes after images from the protests depict many officers outfitted with military-style gear, including armored vehicles, body armor, and assault rifles. In photos circulated online, officers are observed aiming their weapons at demonstrators.\n\n___\n\nAUG. 15, 2014: Police identify the officer who shot Brown as Darren Wilson, who had been with the department since 2011. They also unveil surveillance video that shows Brown taking large quantities of cigarillos from behind the counter of the Ferguson Market and shoving a worker who confronts him as he exits the convenience store. Police allege Brown stole nearly $50 worth of cigarillos. The release of the video angers protestors.\n\n___\n\nAUG. 16, 2014: Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon proclaims a state of emergency and enforces a curfew in Ferguson.\n\n___\n\nAUG. 18, 2014: Nixon summons the National Guard to Ferguson to aid in restoring order. He rescinds the curfew.\n\n___\n\nAUG. 20, 2014: U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder visits Ferguson to provide reassurances about the investigation into Brown's death and to converse with investigators and Brown's family. A grand jury commences hearing evidence to determine whether Wilson should face charges.\n\n___\n\nAUG. 21, 2014: Nixon instructs the National Guard to withdraw from Ferguson.\n\n___\n\nSEPT. 25, 2014: Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson releases a recorded apology to Brown's family and tries to march in solidarity with protestors. The endeavor backfires when Ferguson officers clash with demonstrators and apprehend one individual moments after Jackson, who is white, joins the group.\n\n___\n\nNOV. 17, 2014: Nixon proclaims a state of emergency and activates the National Guard again preceding a decision from a grand jury. He places Ferguson police in charge of security in Ferguson, with orders for them to work as a unified command with other departments.\n\n___\n\nNOV. 18, 2014: Nixon appoints 16 individuals to the Ferguson Commission, an independent panel tasked with examining race relations, failing schools, and other social and economic issues. Nine of its members are Black. Seven are white.\n\n___\n\nNOV. 24, 2014: St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch announces that the grand jury has decided not to indict Wilson. Demonstrations that were intense but peaceful earlier in the day turn violent. At least a dozen buildings and multiple police cars are set ablaze, officers are pelted with rocks and batteries, and reports of gunfire compel some St. Louis-bound flights to be diverted.\n\n___\n\nNOV. 29, 2014: Wilson announces his resignation from the Ferguson Police Department effective immediately.\n\n___\n\nMARCH 4, 2015: The U.S. Department of Justice announces that it will not prosecute Wilson in Brown's death but releases a scathing report that finds racial bias in the way police and courts in the community treat Black individuals.\n\n___\n\nMARCH 11, 2015: Jackson resigns effective March 19. The police chief is the sixth employee to resign or be terminated after the Justice Department report. He is replaced on an interim basis by his top commander, Lt. Col. Al Eickhoff, who is also white.\n\n___\n\nMARCH 12, 2015: Two St. Louis-area police officers are shot in front of the Ferguson Police Department during a demonstration by protestors. Three days later, a 20-year-old man is charged with first-degree assault in the shootings.\n\n___\n\nAPRIL 7, 2015: In Ferguson's first municipal election since Brown's death, two of the three City Council members elected are Black. Black individuals now hold three of six seats, compared with one seat prior to the election.\n\n___\n\nAPRIL 23, 2015: Attorneys for Brown's family sue the city of Ferguson, Wilson, and Jackson.",

(AP) -- The remnants of Debby picked up the pace Friday, moving north and northeast from the Carolinas and still packing a punch with heavy rains, flash flooding and the threat of tornadoes.\n\nThe Mid-Atlantic states and parts of New York and New England will see significant rainfall that could cause dangerous flooding into the weekend, such as on parts of Interstate 95 near bigger cities, said Jon Porter, Accuweather's chief meteorologist. From eastern Virginia up to Vermont there may be an active stretch of tornadoes on Friday, he said.\n\n\"There will be multiple threats in Debby's final chapter, and it's a dangerous one,\" he said.\n\nThe already drenched parts of northern Vermont that were hit by flash flooding twice last month were bracing for the possibility of more on Friday. Flooding that hit the northeastern part of the state on July 30 knocked out bridges, destroyed and damaged homes, and washed away roads in the rural town of Lyndon. It came three weeks after after deadly flooding in the north and center of the state from the remnants of Hurricane Beryl.\n\nDebby was a tropical depression by late Thursday afternoon, the National Hurricane Center said. It made landfall early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida as a Category 1 hurricane. Then, Debby made a second landfall early Thursday in South Carolina as a tropical storm.\n\nFerguson marks 10 years since Michael Brown's death.

(AP) -- Michael Brown once told his father the \"world is going to know my name,\" words Michael Brown Sr. still takes to heart.\n\nFriday marks 10 years since the 18-year-old was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, turning the St. Louis suburb into the focal point of the national reckoning with the historically tense relationship between U.S. law enforcement and Black people.\n\nThe elder Brown now devotes his time to the Michael Brown Sr. Chosen for Change Organization, a foundation that helps fathers, mothers and children come to grips with tragedy in their lives. It's a legacy he feels obligated to pass on under the name he shares with his son.\n\n\"He was going to shake the world,\" Brown said of his son. \"So, I guess that's what we're doing. He's still doing the work from the grave.\"\n\nBrown's death catalyzed massive change in Ferguson. In 2014, every city leader was white in the majority-Black city. Today, the mayor, police chief, city attorney and other leaders are Black. The mostly-white police force of a decade ago now has more officers that are Black than white.\n\nTimeline of events in Ferguson, Missouri, after a police officer fatally shot Michael Brown\n\nFERGUSON, Mo. (AP) -- On Aug. 9, 2014, Michael Brown and a friend were walking in the middle of Canfield Drive, a two-lane street in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Missouri, when a police officer drove by and told them to use the sidewalk.\n\nAfter words were exchanged, the white officer confronted the 18-year-old Brown, who was Black. The situation escalated, with the officer and Brown scuffling. The officer shot and killed Brown, who was unarmed.\n\nThis story is part of an AP ongoing series exploring the impact, legacy and ripple effects of what is widely called the Ferguson uprising, which was sparked a decade ago after the fatal shooting of Brown.\n\nFriday marks the 10th anniversary of the shooting that was a pivotal moment in the national Black Lives Matter movement, and helped spur a reckoning of how Black people in Ferguson and elsewhere in the St. Louis region were treated by police and the courts.\n\nA timeline of key events that followed the shooting:\n\nHarris and Walz head to Arizona, where a VP runner-up could still make a difference\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and her new running mate will hold a rally in Arizona on Friday as part of their tour of electoral battlegrounds, visiting a state where Harris passed over a prominent Democrat in favor of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and gun control advocate, had been a top contender for running mate. He's won two tough races in politically divided Arizona.\n\nIn passing over Kelly, Harris may have also lost the chance to win over people like Gonzalo Leyva, a 49-year-old landscaper in Phoenix. Leyva plans to vote for former President Donald Trump, a Republican, but says he would have backed a Harris-Kelly ticket.\n\n\"I prefer Kelly like 100 times,\" said Leyva, a lifelong Democrat who became an independent at the beginning of Trump's term in office. \"I don't think he's that extreme like the other guys.\"\n\nIn Arizona, every vote will be critical. The state is no stranger to nail-biter races, including in 2020 when President Joe Biden bested Trump by fewer than 11,000 votes. Both parties are bracing for a similar photo finish this year.\n\nA win for the Harris-Walz ticket would also mean the country's first Native American female governor\n\nIf Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are elected this fall, not only would a woman of color lead the country for the first time, but a Native woman also would govern a state for the first time in U.S. history.\n\nPeggy Flanagan, the lieutenant governor of Minnesota and a citizen of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, is poised to serve as the state's next governor should Walz step down to accept the role of U.S. vice president. Her rise to power has been watched closely by Indigenous peoples in Minnesota and across the country who see her as a champion of policies that positively affect Native Americans.\n\nIn recent years, Minnesota has integrated tribal consultation into numerous aspects of the state government, created one of the country's first state offices for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives and strengthened its laws protecting Native children in the adoption system. Many Indigenous leaders point to Flanagan as the driving force behind these changes, as well as a significant rise in respect for tribal sovereignty and autonomy in state policy.\n\nFlanagan has been the nation's highest-ranking Native American statewide official since she was elected as lieutenant governor in 2018. That position is often performed behind the scenes, but Walz and Flanagan have said they chose instead to govern as partners. Their administration has bolstered government-to-government relationships with tribal nations in Minnesota and many in Indian Country see Flanagan as a key figure in a new era of politics with Native women at the forefront.\n\nPresident Joe Biden made a difficult decision to step down and let Harris take his place as the Democratic presidential nominee, Flanagan said.\n\nTrump recommits to a Sept. 10 debate and lashes out at Harris at news conference\n\nPALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Donald Trump recommitted to debating Vice President Kamala Harris after recently backing out, holding a lengthy news conference Thursday in which he taunted his new rival, boasted of his crowd on Jan. 6, 2021, and lashed out at questions about the enthusiasm her campaign has been generating.\n\nAs the Republican presidential nominee addressed reporters at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, ABC announced that Trump and Harris, the Democratic nominee, have agreed to a Sept. 10 debate, setting up a widely anticipated faceoff in an already unparalleled election. Trump said he had proposed three debates with three television networks in September.\n\nTrump again wrongly insisted there had been a \"peaceful transfer\" of power in 2021 and renewed attacks on Republican rivals like Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, whom Trump has harshly criticized since Kemp refused to go along with his false theories of election fraud.\n\nIn taking questions from reporters for more than an hour, Trump tried to draw a contrast with Harris, who has not held a news conference since President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race.\n\nTrump's decision to go on ABC sets up a high-stakes moment in an election where Biden's catastrophic performance in the last debate set in motion his withdrawal.\n\n3rd person in custody over foiled plot targeting now-canceled Taylor Swift shows in Vienna\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- A third teenager has been arrested in connection with a foiled attack on now-canceled Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna, Austria's interior minister said Friday.\n\nAustrian Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said an 18-year-old was taken into custody Thursday evening in Vienna after allegedly being in contact with the main suspect. Karner announced the arrest during an unrelated news conference Friday.\n\nInvestigators are scrutinizing the \"networks\" of the suspects, the Austrian interior ministry told The Associated Press on Friday, adding in a statement that investigators have turned to evaluating physical and electronic evidence.\n\nThe 19-year-old main suspect and a 17-year-old were arrested Tuesday, while a 15-year-old was also interrogated but was not arrested. Officials said Thursday afternoon that no additional suspects were being sought. They did not immediately offer further details Friday.\n\nAuthorities say the plot appeared to have been inspired by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida. Investigators found bomb-making materials at one of the suspects' homes. Officials say one suspect has confessed to planning to \"kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue.\"\n\nInterim leader Muhammad Yunus takes the helm in Bangladesh, to seek peace and prepare elections\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took the oath of office as head of Bangladesh's interim government Thursday after protests forced out former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina this week.\n\nThe key tasks for Yunus now are restoring peace in Bangladesh and preparing for new elections following the ouster of Hasina, who fled to India after weeks of student protests over job quotas grew into an uprising against her increasingly autocratic 15-year rule.\n\nThe figurehead President Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath to Yunus for his role as chief adviser, which is the equivalent to a prime minister, in the presence of diplomats, civil society members, top businessmen and members of the former opposition party at the presidential palace in Dhaka. No representatives of Hasina's party were present.\n\nThe 16 other members of the interim Cabinet were drawn mainly from civil society and include two of the student protest leaders. The Cabinet members were chosen in discussions this week among student leaders, civil society representatives and the military.\n\nThe protests began in July against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favored people with connections to Hasina's party. But she resigned and fled to India on Monday after the protests coalesced into a movement against her government and more than 300 people including students and police officers were killed in the spiraling violence.\n\nVeteran human rights advocate freed in swap says Russia is sliding back toward Stalinist times\n\nBERLIN (AP) -- A human rights activist since the 1980s, Oleg Orlov thought Russia had turned a corner when the Soviet Union collapsed and a democratically elected president became leader.\n\nBut then Vladimir Putin rose to power, crushing dissent and launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Finally, the 71-year-old Orlov was himself thrown in prison for opposing the war. Freed last week in the largest East-West prisoner swap since the Cold War, he was forced into exile -- just like the Soviet dissidents of his youth.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday in Berlin, Orlov decried the scale and severity of repressions under Putin, with people imprisoned for merely criticizing the authorities, something unseen since the days of dictator Josef Stalin.\n\nAnd he's vowing to continue his work to free the many political prisoners in Russia and keep their names in the spotlight.\n\n\"We're sliding somewhere into Stalin times,\" said Orlov, who at times showed signs of fatigue from a hectic schedule of media interviews in the week since his release.\n\nUS and other frustrated mediators call on Israel, Hamas to resume Gaza talks, saying, 'no excuses'\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaders of the United States, Egypt and Qatar jointly demanded Israel and Hamas return to stalled talks on the war in Gaza next week, saying Thursday that \"only the details\" of carrying out a cease-fire and hostage release remain to be negotiated. \"There is no further time to waste, nor excuses from any party for further delay,\" they said in a joint statement.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Thursday, \"Pursuant to the proposal by the U.S. and the mediators, Israel will -- on 15 August -- send the negotiations team to a place to be determined in order to finalize the details of the implementation of the framework agreement.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Qatari Emir Tamim al-Thani, mediators in indirect negotiations to end 10 months of devastating war in Gaza, set the talks for Aug. 15, to take place in either Doha, Qatar, or Cairo.\n\nA senior U.S. official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss the push by mediators, said only four or five areas of disagreement over implementation remained to be resolved between the two opponents.\n\nThe official cited the timing of a planned swap of Palestinian detainees held by Israel, and hostages held by Hamas, as an example.", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Today, Local Leaders Are Still Striving for Change", "body": "Corin Cesaric is an Associate Editor at PEOPLE. They have been working at PEOPLE for one year.\n\nOn August 9, 2014, 18-year-old Michael Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson were in Ferguson, Mo., when they were stopped by a police officer for walking in the middle of the street. Not long after, Brown was shot multiple times by a police officer.\n\nThe tragic incident resulted in no criminal charges -- and community upheaval.\n\nBrown, known as \"Big Mike\" to his friends and \"Mike Mike\" to his family, was unarmed during the incident, but witness accounts vary on if he was running from officer Darren Wilson when he was killed.\n\nJohnson claimed to detectives that when the pair were first confronted by Wilson for walking in the street, Wilson backed up his patrol car and opened the car door. Johnson told detectives that the door hit him and Brown, causing it to shut again. Subsequently, according to Johnson, Wilson grabbed Brown by the neck and an altercation ensued through the open window while Wilson was still in the vehicle.\n\nJohnson said he heard Wilson say, \"I'll shoot you,\" before his gun went off and Brown was hit. Then, according to Johnson, both Brown and Johnson began to run, and Brown was shot again. Brown stopped running, and, according to Johnson, turned around and put his hands in the air to surrender.\n\n\"As he turns around, the officer's face-to-face with him now and he goes to tell the officer that he's unarmed or he does not have a gun,\" Johnson told detectives, according to a transcript of the interview shared by The New York Times. \"I couldn't hear him verbatim from where I was standing but I know he tried to talk to the officer and he tried to get out a second sentence, but before he could fully get out the sentence, the officer fired several more shots.\"\n\n\"I could no longer see the officer's face. I could see the back of him. I could see Big Mike's front. So, I see that he's taken shots,\" Johnson added. \"I see the pain in his face. He cannot say nothin', he's not screaming 'cause I feel like he's still in shock because each time, each time he's shot, he's trying to get another word out until the fatal shot.\"\n\nBrown's body was in the street for more than four hours as neighbors -- and his family -- watched the scene unfold. According to an autopsy report, Brown was shot at least 6 times.\n\nJohnson's account of the incident -- specifically Brown raising his hands to show he was unarmed -- is why \"Hands Up, Don't Shoot\" became a popular slogan used during protests regarding police killings of Black Americans.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? Sign up for PEOPLE's free True Crime newsletter for breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases.\n\nWhen interviewed by detectives in the aftermath of the killing, Wilson, then 28, told detectives a different version of events. In an August 10, 2014 interview, Wilson said he approached Brown and Johnson in the street and stated, \"Hey guys, why don't you walk on the sidewalk.\" (Johnson told detectives that Wilson told them, \"Get the f--- on the sidewalk.\")\n\nWilson also said Brown was reaching for the officer's weapon during the first shots. Wilson said that during the subsequent shots -- which were the fatal shots -- that Brown was running toward Wilson. Wilson has maintained from the beginning that he shot Brown in self-defense.\n\nAlthough the events leading up to Brown's death have long been disputed, one thing for certain is that his killing brought the relationship between police and Black Americans to the forefront. It also bolstered the Black Lives Matter movement just over a year after the term was coined in the aftermath of George Zimmerman being acquitted of murder after shooting Trayvon Martin in Florida.\n\nThe day after Brown's death, peaceful protests began in Ferguson and the surrounding St. Louis area, but in some areas, the protests turned into riots. The protests lasted for months and are now remembered as The Ferguson Uprising.\n\nThen-Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon implemented a curfew in Ferguson and declared a state of emergency. Now-iconic photos, including one of a man in an American flag shirt throwing a tear gas canister back at police officers, have now been cemented in history, and some of the initial protestors have since become prominent civil rights activists.\n\nAfter a months-long investigation, Wilson was not charged in connection with Brown's death.

Today, Local Leaders Are Still Striving for Change", "body": "On August 9, 2014, Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Mo., bringing race relations between Black Americans and police to the forefront\n\nOn August 9, 2014, 18-year-old Michael Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson were in Ferguson, Mo., when they were stopped by a police officer for walking in the middle of the street. Not long after, Brown was shot multiple times by a police officer.\n\nThe tragic incident resulted in no criminal charges -- and community upheaval.\n\nBrown, known as \"Big Mike\" to his friends and \"Mike Mike\" to his family, was unarmed during the incident, but witness accounts vary on if he was running from officer Darren Wilson when he was killed.\n\nJohnson claimed to detectives that when the pair were first confronted by Wilson for walking in the street, Wilson backed up his patrol car and opened the car door. Johnson told detectives that the door hit him and Brown, causing it to shut again. Subsequently, according to Johnson, Wilson grabbed Brown by the neck and an altercation ensued through the open window while Wilson was still in the vehicle.\n\nJohnson said he heard Wilson say, \"I'll shoot you,\" before his gun went off and Brown was hit. Then, according to Johnson, both Brown and Johnson began to run, and Brown was shot again. Brown stopped running, and, according to Johnson, turned around and put his hands in the air to surrender.\n\n\"As he turns around, the officer's face-to-face with him now and he goes to tell the officer that he's unarmed or he does not have a gun,\" Johnson told detectives, according to a transcript of the interview shared by The New York Times. \"I couldn't hear him verbatim from where I was standing but I know he tried to talk to the officer and he tried to get out a second sentence, but before he could fully get out the sentence, the officer fired several more shots.\"\n\n\"I could no longer see the officer's face. I could see the back of him. I could see Big Mike's front. So, I see that he's taken shots,\" Johnson added. \"I see the pain in his face. He cannot say nothin', he's not screaming 'cause I feel like he's still in shock because each time, each time he's shot, he's trying to get another word out until the fatal shot.\"\n\nBrown's body was in the street for more than four hours as neighbors -- and his family -- watched the scene unfold. According to an autopsy report, Brown was shot at least 6 times.\n\nJohnson's account of the incident -- specifically Brown raising his hands to show he was unarmed -- is why \"Hands Up, Don't Shoot\" became a popular slogan used during protests regarding police killings of Black Americans.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? Sign up for PEOPLE's free True Crime newsletter for breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases.\n\nWhen interviewed by detectives in the aftermath of the killing, Wilson, then 28, told detectives a different version of events. In an August 10, 2014 interview, Wilson said he approached Brown and Johnson in the street and stated, \"Hey guys, why don't you walk on the sidewalk.\" (Johnson told detectives that Wilson told them, \"Get the f--- on the sidewalk.\")\n\nWilson also said Brown was reaching for the officer's weapon during the first shots. Wilson said that during the subsequent shots -- which were the fatal shots -- that Brown was running toward Wilson. Wilson has maintained from the beginning that he shot Brown in self-defense.\n\nAlthough the events leading up to Brown's death have long been disputed, one thing for certain is that his killing brought the relationship between police and Black Americans to the forefront. It also bolstered the Black Lives Matter movement just over a year after the term was coined in the aftermath of George Zimmerman being acquitted of murder after shooting Trayvon Martin in Florida.\n\nThe day after Brown's death, peaceful protests began in Ferguson and the surrounding St. Louis area, but in some areas, the protests turned into riots. The protests lasted for months and are now remembered as The Ferguson Uprising.\n\nThen-Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon implemented a curfew in Ferguson and declared a state of emergency. Now-iconic photos, including one of a man in an American flag shirt throwing a tear gas canister back at police officers, have now been cemented in history, and some of the initial protestors have since become prominent civil rights activists.\n\nAfter a months-long investigation, Wilson was not charged in connection with Brown's death. St. Louis County prosecuting attorney Wesley Bell announced in a press conference at the time that they were unable to \"prove beyond a reasonable doubt that, when Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown, he committed murder or manslaughter under Missouri law.\"\n\nRelated: Former Cop Who Fatally Shot Michael Brown Will Not Be Charged Following New Investigation: Prosecutor\n\nBut the news that Wilson would not be charged was roundly criticized. In Ferguson, protests turned violent and the nation watched as buildings burned, windows were smashed and law enforcement used tear gas against crowds. Days later, Wilson resigned from the Ferguson Police Department.\n\nAlthough there was no longer a possibility of a criminal trial, over the ensuing months and years, changes in Ferguson were implemented.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, in April 2016, Ferguson and the Justice Department reached an agreement to reform the city's police and court systems after months-long discussions about police treatment of Black Americans.\n\nDuring the months of unrest in Ferguson, Nixon also appointed 16 people to The Ferguson Commission in order to conduct a \"thorough, wide-ranging and unflinching study of the social and economic conditions that impede progress, equality and safety in the St. Louis region.\"\n\nFrom the commission came Forward Through Ferguson, a non-profit organization working \"to be a catalyst for lasting positive change in the St. Louis region as outlined in the Ferguson Commission Report,\" according to its mission statement.\n\nForward Through Ferguson Executive Director Annissa McCaskill told St. Louis Magazine that \"work has been done, but the work is generational,\" while outlining both progress and the ways conditions still must improve for Black Americans.\n\nA QuickTrip convenience store located roughly a mile from where Brown was killed was burned down in the days after August 9, 2014, but today, it is the headquarters of The Ferguson Community Empowerment Center. According to KSDK, the location offers a workforce development program from the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis and additional services provided by the Salvation Army, Lutheran Hope Center and University of Missouri Extension.\n\nThe current Ferguson Police Chief Troy Doyle released a statement on Aug. 9 to mark the anniversary of Brown's death, stating in part: \"A decade later, Ferguson PD stands transformed.

But the events from 10 years ago still served as a catalyst for change in Ferguson -- and beyond.\n\n\"What made me think it could and would change was the people in the streets in Ferguson in 2014,\" Blake Strode, the executive director of ArchCity Defenders told Morning Edition.\n\nFerguson isn't the same place it was 10 years ago, and many people who call it home are trying to make it better.\n\nSystemic problems plagued the city 10 years ago. Have they been fixed?\n\nMichael Brown's killing led to a Department of Justice investigation of the shooting and Ferguson's police department.\n\nThe DOJ found that the Ferguson police department was incentivized and encouraged to lobby municipal fines and fees on individuals to generate revenue for the city and that these fines disproportionately were issued to Black people in the city.\n\n\"Even relatively routine misconduct by Ferguson police officers can have significant consequences for the people whose rights are violated,\" the 100-page report read.\n\n\"I think what people here have known to be true for a very long time is that the institutions like the police and surveil, arrest and target people. I think they knew that on Aug. 9, 2014, and they know that now,\" said Strode of ArchCity Defenders. This legal advocacy organization was the first to raise the alarm about the fines and fees system in Ferguson.\n\nArchCity Defenders has seen a significant decrease in the amount of fines and fees issued to residents in Ferguson and the surrounding municipalities. In 2013, municipal court revenues in the Saint Louis region were about $61 million in 2023.\n\nLast year, that figure was $17.8 million.\n\n\"When we talk to our clients, many of them talk about the night and day experience of moving, working and traveling through their neighborhoods, their municipalities, their hometowns,\" Strode told Morning Edition.\n\nThe DOJ issued a federal consent decree in 2016 to the Ferguson Police Department after its investigation, requiring the department to adhere to mandates in order to reform their police system. Those included police training for officers, more community engagement and performance evaluations for officers.\n\n\"When I got here, officers were still walking around with their heads down, because they felt like just over the years, they continue to get beat up, you know, in the public in regards to what took place in 2014,\" Ferguson Chief of Police Troy Doyle told NPR's Michel Martin in his office.\n\nDoyle became Ferguson's police chief last year. The city has had a string of police chiefs since former Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown in 2014.\n\nBefore he was named police chief, Doyle spent 31 years in the St. Louis County Police Department. He retired from his position as Lieutenant Colonel two years after filing a racial discrimination lawsuit against another officer at the St. Louis County police department.\n\nDoyle points to programs he's implemented when talking about how the police department has improved. There have also been significant changes in the racial makeup of the police department: 10 years ago, there were only three Black police officers in Ferguson. Now, roughly half the police force in Ferguson is Black, he said.\n\nEven the police uniforms have changed.\n\n\"When you see the old Ferguson police cars or uniforms and also get out of the car, trigger some people in our community, \"Doyle said. \"So I wanted to get totally away from that.\"\n\nDoyle is hoping that the police department will be completely compliant with the federal consent decree in the next two years.\n\n\"When you're in the position I am as a chief of police, I am the final decision here at this police department,\" Doyle said. \"So that's where my optimism comes from, because I can set the tone in the practices that would take place here at this police department.\"\n\nBut activists like Strode think that no matter how much police reform is done, there are systemic problems in St. Louis that prevent meaningful change. The biggest one is the fact that the county is composed of small municipalities, each with their own police force, courts and standards for operating.\n\nUnlike fines and fees, the amount municipalities have increased in the last 10 years: there are now 84 municipalities in St. Louis. They were 81 in 2014.\n\n\"It's just a system that no one would design unless you were actually trying to profit from poor people,\" Strode said.\n\nStrode believes that consolidating the municipalities under one court system and police force would greatly reduce the amount of over policing in these areas by forcing the system to stop focusing on generating revenue.\n\n\"People would live much better, freer lives if we didn't have this kind of petty policing of their activities day in and day out,\" Strode said.\n\nBut Doyle thinks smaller police departments are an advantage.\n\n\"Some cities like to have a smaller police department because they feel more intimate with the officers that work there,\" Doyle said.\n\nHow a burned down QuikTrip shows change in Ferguson\n\nThe day after QuikTrip, a gas station less than a mile away from where Michael Brown was killed, burned down, Michael McMillan, the president of the Urban League in St. Louis called Michael Johnson, the only Black person on the board of directors at QuikTrip.\n\n\"I said, Michael, you can't just let this be vacant, abandoned, derelict. This is going to be an eyesore and it's going to be a source of decay,\" McMillan said.\n\nMcMillan recalls talking to Johnson every day about what could be done with the empty lot. QuikTrip didn't plan to rebuild the gas station, so it decided to donate the space to the Urban League and Salvation Army, who were interested in opening a community center. It was the first time ever the Urban League, which is over 100 years old, had ever taken on owning and building a center.\n\n\"It pushed me and the team at the Urban League to do things that we had never done before because they needed to be done,\" McMillan said.\n\nThe Urban League's headquarters are in East St. Louis, closer to the heart of the city. McMillan says that the Urban League never thought a lot about poverty in the suburbs of the city until the death of Michael Brown, which brought attention to the high amounts of poverty in suburban areas near the edges of cities like St. Louis.\n\n\"If you look at the inner city, there's a huge amount of non-profit social service agencies,\" McMillan said. \"And people didn't really think that you needed to expand that much into North County.\"\n\nNPR met McMillan in his office at the Ferguson Community Empowerment Center, which opened in 2017 on the site of the QuikTrip that burned. The center is a multipurpose facility that serves as the headquarters for things like workforce programs for Black men, emergency assistance services and after school programs for kids.\n\n\"The center is for opportunity and new beginnings,\" said LaKeysha Fields, the St Louis Regional Social Services Director for the Salvation Army.\n\nAnd it's not the only new nonprofit in the area: there's also a senior living center where an AutoZone once stood, and a Boys and Girls Club less than a mile away from where Michael Brown was shot. The Urban League also broke ground on another project recently: it plans to turn two vacant lots into a plaza, anchored by a bank and a small convention center.\n\nStill, many lots sit vacant, as do abandoned apartments and boarded up buildings all throughout West Florissant Avenue, the main street in the city.\n\n\"I'm very hopeful that we can kind of plateau and rebuild and bring more businesses, institutions, you know, commercial activity on this major corridor,\" McMillan said. \"And then as a result, maybe people see the revitalization and want to rent in some of these apartment complexes and buy homes.\"\n\nNone of these new organizations had a large presence in the Ferguson area before 2014, but now they are some of the first things people see when they drive down West Florissant Avenue.\n\n\"I don't know that this building being here would have prevented what happened. Hopefully there would have been some buffer, less likelihood,\" Fields said.\n\nWhat's left to be done beyond Ferguson\n\nNPR spoke to some Ferguson residents and asked how they feel their city has changed.\n\nHenry Jones, Ollie Brown and Willy Powell, whom NPR met at a city park, all said they feel like things have especially improved in Ferguson's police department.\n\nWhile they might feel safer than they did a decade ago, all three of them agreed that there was more to be done, specifically for kids in the area who can often be victims and perpetrators of violence.\n\n\"We're watching them and they are like a train out of control,\" Brown said.\n\nBut they don't think that's a change that can happen with more policing.\n\n\"Police can't control them,\" Powell said. \"It starts in the home.\"\n\nThe point that reform goes beyond policing is what activist DeRay Mckesson, who became a well-known figure after the Ferguson protests in 2014, has argued for years. Mckesson now runs Campaign Zero, a social justice organization that works to reduce the power and reliance on police.\n\nThe group, he said, is working to highlight and change laws that can lead to more encounters with law enforcement and to reduce ways that formerly incarcerated people can get tangled up with the legal system again.\n\nHe pushes back against the notion that some reform hasn't happened.\n\n\"I do think there's a weird thing that happened where there are people who want this narrative that nothing has changed,\" Mckesson said.\n\nHe points to the attempt to pass the George Floyd Policing Act in Congress, new state laws prohibiting police from executing no-knock raids in Pennsylvania and new requirements for police departments to hand over data as signs of progress in police reform.\n\nThough national scale reform for the nearly 18,000 police departments in the United States hasn't happened, McKesson doesn't feel like solutions to issues in policing can come from the federal government.\n\n\"I think that people have been looking for something like a national silver bullet as opposed to understanding that the best version of the change will be a 50-state strategy,\" McKesson said.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mansee_khurana@npr.org", "name": "Mansee Khurana", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Accuweather's chief meteorologist Jon Porter said the Mid-Atlantic states and parts of New York and New England will see significant rainfall that could cause dangerous flooding into the weekend, such as on parts of Interstate 95 near bigger cities. From eastern Virginia up to Vermont, an active stretch of tornadoes was also possible on Friday. Tornadoes spawned by Debby have leveled homes, damaged a school and killed one person. The tropical storm was downgraded to a tropical depression Thursday afternoon.\n\nFerguson marks 10 years since Michael Brown's death. While there's some progress, challenges persist\n\nFERGUSON, Mo. (AP) -- Michael Brown's death was the catalyst for massive change starting in Ferguson, Missouri. Ten years later, those in the community cite significant progress, but say challenges remain. Every city leader was white in the majority-Black city in 2014. Today, the mayor, police chief, city attorney and other leaders are Black. The mostly-white police force of 2014 now has more officers that are Black than white. The municipal court system that once brought in millions of dollars in court fines and fees paid mostly by poor residents now collects only a fraction of that. But many acknowledge that race still divides the community of 18,000 residents.\n\nTimeline of events in Ferguson, Missouri, after a police officer fatally shot Michael Brown\n\nFERGUSON, Mo. (AP) -- On Aug. 9, 2014, Michael Brown and a friend were walking in the middle of Canfield Drive, a two-lane street in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Missouri, when a police officer drove by and told them to use the sidewalk. After words were exchanged, the white officer confronted the 18-year-old Brown, who was Black. The situation escalated, with the officer and Brown scuffling. The officer shot and killed Brown, who was unarmed. Months of unrest followed. Friday marks the 10th anniversary of the shooting that was a pivotal moment in the national Black Lives Matter movement, and helped spur a reckoning of how Black people in Ferguson and elsewhere in the St. Louis region were treated by police and the courts.\n\nHarris and Walz head to Arizona, where a VP runner-up could still make a difference\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate are campaigning in Arizona as the latest stop on their tour of battleground states. The Arizona swing is especially significant because Harris passed over the state's junior senator, Mark Kelly, in favor of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate. That may cost her a handful of votes in a state that President Joe Biden won by less than 11,000 votes in 2020. But the state is also chock full of Midwesterners who may warm to Walz. And Democrats say the same energy that's greeted Harris at earlier stops on her battleground tour is present in Arizona.\n\nA win for the Harris-Walz ticket would also mean the country's first Native American female governor\n\nIf Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz officially steps down later this year to accept the position of U.S. vice president, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan would become the first Native woman to govern a state. Flanagan is a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe and became the highest ranking Native American statewide official in the country when she was elected to office in 2018. She has helped shape Walz's administration as one focused on improving tribal sovereignty and autonomy across Minnesota. She is one of several Indigenous women who have taken seats of power in the U.S. over the past decade, and many in Indian Country see her rise to power as an opportunity for increased Indigenous rights and visibility.\n\nTrump recommits to a Sept. 10 debate and lashes out at Harris at news conference\n\nPALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Donald Trump has recommitted to debating Vice President Kamala Harris after recently backing out. The Republican presidential nominee held a lengthy news conference Thursday in which he taunted his new rival, boasted of his crowd on Jan. 6, 2021, and lashed out at questions about the enthusiasm her campaign has been generating. As he addressed reporters at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, ABC announced that Trump and Harris have agreed to a Sept. 10 presidential debate. In taking questions from reporters for more than an hour, Trump tried to draw a contrast with Harris, who has not held a news conference since she became the likely Democratic nominee following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race.\n\n3rd person in custody over foiled plot targeting now-canceled Taylor Swift shows in Vienna\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- A third teenager has been arrested in connection with a foiled attack on now-canceled Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna. Austrian Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said an 18-year-old was taken into custody after allegedly being in contact with the main suspect. Austrian public broadcaster PRF says Karner announced the arrest during an unrelated news conference Friday. Authorities say the plot appeared to be inspired by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida. Investigators are scrutinizing the \"networks\" of the suspects, the Austrian interior ministry told The Associated Press on Friday, adding in a statement that investigators have turned to evaluating physical and electronic evidence.\n\nInterim leader Muhammad Yunus takes the helm in Bangladesh, to seek peace and prepare elections\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus has taken the oath of office to lead Bangladesh's interim government after protests forced out Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina this week. The key tasks for Yunus now are restoring peace in the South Asian country and preparing for new elections following the ouster of Hasina, who fled to India after student protests over job quotas grew into an uprising against her increasingly autocratic 15-year rule. The figurehead president administered the oath to Yunus for his role as chief adviser, which is the equivalent to a prime minister, in the presence of diplomats, civil society members and top businessmen at the presidential palace in Dhaka.\n\nVeteran human rights advocate freed in swap says Russia is sliding back toward Stalinist times\n\nBERLIN (AP) -- A human rights activist since the 1980s, Oleg Orlov thought Russia had turned a corner when the Soviet Union collapsed and a democratically elected president became leader. But then Vladimir Putin rose to power, crushing dissent and launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Finally, the 71-year-old Orlov was himself thrown in prison for opposing the war. Freed last week in the largest East-West prisoner swap since the Cold War, Orlov told The Associated Press that Russia is backsliding toward the days of dictator Josef Stalin. He is vowing to work from exile to try to free as many political prisoners as possible and keep their cases in the spotlight.\n\nUS and other frustrated mediators call on Israel, Hamas to resume Gaza talks, saying, 'no excuses'\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaders of the United States, Egypt and Qatar are jointly demanding that Israel and Hamas return to stalled talks on the war in Gaza. The three leaders issued a statement Thursday saying \"only the details\" remain to get a cease-fire deal and hostage release. President Joe Biden, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Emir Tamim al-Thani of Qatar are signaling growing frustration, saying they would accept \"no excuses from any party for further delay.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Thursday that it had agreed to attend the Aug. 15 talks. There was no immediate word from Hamas. Hamas' top representative to the talks was killed July 31 in an assassination widely blamed on Israel.\n\nMore from this section\n\nSecured Signing Notary Community platform enables notaries to connect with clients online, receive jobs, and chat directly\n\nHarris introduces new running mate Minnesota Gov.

The police chief and more than half of the police officers are Black. And St. Louis County elected its first Black prosecutor.\n\n\"Ferguson gave birth to all kinds of young people who were committed to civil rights and social justice and representation,\" said Kimberly Norwood, a Washington University law professor and editor of \"Ferguson's Fault Lines: The Race Quake That Rocked a Nation.\"\n\nBrown's death was part of a series of high-profile police killings over a decade, from Eric Garner to Sonya Massey. Two years before Brown died, Trayvon Martin had been killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer, drawing protests across the nation. Taken collectively, the violence against African Americans catalyzed the national Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nResidents say there is more work to be done to rebuild trust in the community, but there have been some changes over the decade, including the use of body cameras in police departments across the country. In Ferguson, the police department is under a federal consent decree to improve its practices.\n\nTen summers after Brown's death, some of the early protest front-liners in Ferguson are now in the corridors of power, elected to seats in government or leading campaigns to help elect progressive Black candidates.\n\n\"Over time, we started to realize that this issue with police brutality and what happened to Mike Brown was a lot bigger,\" said Rasheen Aldridge, 30, a protester who now serves on the St. Louis Board of Aldermen in the city's 14th Ward. \"It's about how people that are in local government have input on the way that people live.\"\n\nThe most high-profile example of the political reach of the Ferguson uprising was this week's Democratic primary in Missouri's 1st Congressional District, where the front-runners were two Black candidates whose political identities were formed, in part, during the protests.\n\nTwo-term US Representative Cori Bush, who drew support from the movement and was endorsed by Brown's father, lost her seat to Wesley Bell, 49, the chief prosecutor for St. Louis County. His campaign was bolstered by a powerful pro-Israel lobby group that poured in more than $8 million through a political action committee.\n\nBush, 48, was among the most prominent protest voices, spending hundreds of days demonstrating alongside community members. Two years after Brown's death, she entered politics with an unsuccessful bid for the US Senate, followed by a House of Representatives loss two years later. But in 2020, she unseated Representative William Lacy Clay, a 10-term Democrat, becoming the first organizer from the larger Black Lives Matter movement elected to Congress. Bush won again in 2022.\n\nDuring the unrest, Bell, a lawyer, acted as a mediator and later hosted community listening sessions. He was elected to the Ferguson City Council in the first election after the protests and later unseated Robert P. McCulloch, the St. Louis County prosecutor who was widely criticized after declining to indict Brown's killer. (Bell would later reach the same conclusion in his own investigation, much to the disappointment of many in the activist community.)\n\nThe congressional race \"demonstrates that movements can take one of their own and advance into places where they never thought they would be,\" said Starsky Wilson, who served as a co-chair of the Ferguson Commission, a group assembled to examine racial and economic disparities in the St. Louis region. He is now president of the Children's Defense Fund.\n\nIn the hours after Brown was killed along Canfield Drive -- now home to a memorial plaque embedded in the sidewalk -- Kayla Reed joined the growing crowd, drawn in by images racing across social media.\n\nThat night changed her career path. She went from being a spectator to a protester to organizing the protests to starting campaigns to elect progressive candidates.\n\nReed eventually went to work as an organizer for the Organization for Black Struggle in St. Louis. Her first two campaigns were the Ferguson municipal elections and the creation the St. Louis Civilian Oversight Board.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson_unrest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ferguson unrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_County,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis County, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis County, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Eric_Garner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Killing of Eric Garner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trayvon_Martin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trayvon Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black Lives Matter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_University_in_St._Louis", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington University in St. Louis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief of police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasheen_Aldridge_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rasheen Aldridge Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Board_of_Aldermen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Board of Aldermen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cori_Bush", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cori Bush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri's_1st_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missouri's 1st congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Bell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wesley Bell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police brutality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent_decree", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consent decree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacy_Clay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lacy Clay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_P._McCulloch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert P.

In Ferguson, the police department is under a federal consent decree to improve its practices.\n\nTen summers after Mr. Brown's death, some of the early protest front-liners in Ferguson are now in the corridors of power, elected to seats in government or leading campaigns to help elect progressive Black candidates.\n\n\"Over time, we started to realize that this issue with police brutality and what happened to Mike Brown was a lot bigger,\" said Rasheen Aldridge, 30, a protester who now serves on the St. Louis Board of Aldermen in the city's 14th Ward. \"It's about how people that are in local government have input on the way that people live.\"\n\nThe most high-profile example of the political reach of the Ferguson uprising was this week's Democratic primary in Missouri's First Congressional District, where the front-runners were two Black candidates whose political identities were formed, in part, during the protests.\n\nThe two-term U.S. Representative Cori Bush, who drew support from the movement and was endorsed by Mr. Brown's father, lost her seat to Wesley Bell, 49, the chief prosecutor for St. Louis County. His campaign was bolstered by a powerful pro-Israel lobby group that poured in more than $8 million through a political action committee.\n\nMs. Bush, 48, was among the most prominent protest voices, spending hundreds of days demonstrating alongside community members. Two years after Mr. Brown's death, she entered politics with an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate, followed by a House of Representatives loss two years later. But in 2020, she unseated Representative William Lacy Clay, a 10-term Democrat, becoming the first organizer from the larger Black Lives Matter movement elected to Congress. Ms. Bush won again in 2022.\n\nDuring the unrest, Mr. Bell, a lawyer, acted as a mediator and later hosted community listening sessions. He was elected to the Ferguson City Council in the first election after the protests and later unseated Robert P. McCulloch, the St. Louis County prosecutor who was widely criticized after declining to indict Mr. Brown's killer. (Mr. Bell would later reach the same conclusion in his own investigation, much to the disappointment of many in the activist community.)\n\nThe congressional race \"demonstrates that movements can take one of their own and advance into places where they never thought they would be,\" said Starsky Wilson, who served as a co-chairman of the Ferguson Commission, a group assembled to examine racial and economic disparities in the St. Louis region. He is now president of the Children's Defense Fund.\n\nFran Griffin, 43, attended her first City Council meeting after Mr. Brown's death. In the weeks after the shooting, she had been protesting, marching, demanding justice. What she wanted, she said, was accountability, but also a way to make sure community voices were heard. In 2016, she ran unsuccessfully for a council seat as a write-in candidate. Three years later, she won and served a single term.\n\n\"I had never considered this kind of position before,\" she said. \"Our whole community was mourning, and the police had treated us inhumanely. It was the principle for me. I knew during the protests that I was going to get involved.\"\n\nIn the hours after Mr. Brown was killed along Canfield Drive -- now home to a memorial plaque embedded in the sidewalk -- Kayla Reed joined the growing crowd, drawn in by images racing across social media.\n\nThat night changed her career path. She went from being a spectator to a protester to organizing the protests to starting campaigns to elect progressive candidates.\n\nThose initial protests were mostly about justice and accountability. Both state and federal prosecutors would later decline to charge the police officer, Darren Wilson, who resigned after the shooting.\n\nBut Mr. Brown's death and the circumstances would come to carry even more import -- a symbol of indifference, and failed relations between law enforcement personnel and Black communities.\n\nAt the time, about 70 percent of Ferguson's 21,000 residents were Black, yet the mayor, five of the six City Council members and the police chief were white. Voter turnout was also depressed, with elections drawing about 12 percent of registered voters. There was something else at work in Ferguson that deepened the divides. A 2015 Justice Department investigation reported that the city routinely violated the civil rights of African Americans and used its police force and courts to generate revenue by writing tickets and assessing fines and fees, disproportionately to Black people, to feed the city budget.\n\nMs. Reed eventually went to work as an organizer for the Organization For Black Struggle in St. Louis. Her first two campaigns were the Ferguson municipal elections and the creation the St. Louis Civilian Oversight Board.\n\n\"We could shout the policies at the people we didn't vote for and who have no concern about us, or we could change the demographic one seat at a time,\" she said.\n\nIn 2016, Ms. Reed co-founded Action St. Louis, a racial justice organization dedicated to building Black power in the St. Louis region, and Action STL Power Project, its political and advocacy arm. Among its first campaign wins was its push for the closure of a medium-security jail in St. Louis known for its inhumane treatment of prisoners. The group also took on the 2017 St. Louis mayoral race, backing a progressive candidate, Tishaura Jones. Ms. Jones was narrowly defeated. Four years later, Ms. Reed's team expanded its campaign, knocking on about 60,000 doors, helping usher in a Jones victory.\n\nIn the decade since Mr. Brown's death, Ms. Reed has been focused on organizing the St. Louis region to create better outcomes for Black people.\n\n\"Ferguson creates this moment where everybody comes outside of their house and has to think about a different scale of us,\" Ms. Reed said. \"'Us' is not just me and my kids -- 'us' is Black people in St. Louis. And when we start thinking about a different scale of us, what becomes possible is power. \"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Black power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Black Lives Matter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson_unrest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ferguson unrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_County,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis County, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis County, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Michael_Brown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Killing of Michael Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Eric_Garner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Killing of Eric Garner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trayvon_Martin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trayvon Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_University_in_St._Louis", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington University in St. Louis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief of police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Convenience store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasheen_Aldridge_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rasheen Aldridge Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Bell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wesley Bell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacy_Clay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lacy Clay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_P._McCulloch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert P.

(AP) -- Debby's final chapter involves moving north and northeast from the Carolinas at a faster clip with soaking rains, flash flooding and the threat of tornadoes into the weekend. Accuweather's chief meteorologist Jon Porter said the Mid-Atlantic states and parts of New York and New England will see significant rainfall that could cause dangerous flooding into the weekend, such as on parts of Interstate 95 near bigger cities. From eastern Virginia up to Vermont, an active stretch of tornadoes was also possible on Friday. Tornadoes spawned by Debby have leveled homes, damaged a school and killed one person. The tropical storm was downgraded to a tropical depression Thursday afternoon.\n\nFerguson marks 10 years since Michael Brown's death. While there's some progress, challenges persist\n\nFERGUSON, Mo. (AP) -- Michael Brown's death was the catalyst for massive change starting in Ferguson, Missouri. Ten years later, those in the community cite significant progress, but say challenges remain. Every city leader was white in the majority-Black city in 2014. Today, the mayor, police chief, city attorney and other leaders are Black. The mostly-white police force of 2014 now has more officers that are Black than white. The municipal court system that once brought in millions of dollars in court fines and fees paid mostly by poor residents now collects only a fraction of that. But many acknowledge that race still divides the community of 18,000 residents.\n\nTimeline of events in Ferguson, Missouri, after a police officer fatally shot Michael Brown\n\nFERGUSON, Mo. (AP) -- On Aug. 9, 2014, Michael Brown and a friend were walking in the middle of Canfield Drive, a two-lane street in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Missouri, when a police officer drove by and told them to use the sidewalk. After words were exchanged, the white officer confronted the 18-year-old Brown, who was Black. The situation escalated, with the officer and Brown scuffling. The officer shot and killed Brown, who was unarmed. Months of unrest followed. Friday marks the 10th anniversary of the shooting that was a pivotal moment in the national Black Lives Matter movement, and helped spur a reckoning of how Black people in Ferguson and elsewhere in the St. Louis region were treated by police and the courts.\n\nHarris and Walz head to Arizona, where a VP runner-up could still make a difference\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate are campaigning in Arizona as the latest stop on their tour of battleground states. The Arizona swing is especially significant because Harris passed over the state's junior senator, Mark Kelly, in favor of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate. That may cost her a handful of votes in a state that President Joe Biden won by less than 11,000 votes in 2020. But the state is also chock full of Midwesterners who may warm to Walz. And Democrats say the same energy that's greeted Harris at earlier stops on her battleground tour is present in Arizona.\n\nA win for the Harris-Walz ticket would also mean the country's first Native American female governor\n\nIf Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz officially steps down later this year to accept the position of U.S. vice president, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan would become the first Native woman to govern a state. Flanagan is a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe and became the highest ranking Native American statewide official in the country when she was elected to office in 2018. She has helped shape Walz's administration as one focused on improving tribal sovereignty and autonomy across Minnesota. She is one of several Indigenous women who have taken seats of power in the U.S. over the past decade, and many in Indian Country see her rise to power as an opportunity for increased Indigenous rights and visibility.\n\nTrump recommits to a Sept. 10 debate and lashes out at Harris at news conference\n\nPALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Donald Trump has recommitted to debating Vice President Kamala Harris after recently backing out. The Republican presidential nominee held a lengthy news conference Thursday in which he taunted his new rival, boasted of his crowd on Jan. 6, 2021, and lashed out at questions about the enthusiasm her campaign has been generating. As he addressed reporters at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, ABC announced that Trump and Harris have agreed to a Sept. 10 presidential debate. In taking questions from reporters for more than an hour, Trump tried to draw a contrast with Harris, who has not held a news conference since she became the likely Democratic nominee following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race.\n\n3rd person in custody over foiled plot targeting now-canceled Taylor Swift shows in Vienna\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- Investigators are scrutinizing the \"networks\" of the suspects arrested in connection with a foiled plot to attack three Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna, the Austrian interior ministry told The Associated Press on Friday. Investigators have turned to evaluating physical and electronic evidence, the statement said. One main suspect and two others have been arrested.\n\nInterim leader Muhammad Yunus takes the helm in Bangladesh, to seek peace and prepare elections\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus has taken the oath of office to lead Bangladesh's interim government after protests forced out Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina this week. The key tasks for Yunus now are restoring peace in the South Asian country and preparing for new elections following the ouster of Hasina, who fled to India after student protests over job quotas grew into an uprising against her increasingly autocratic 15-year rule. The figurehead president administered the oath to Yunus for his role as chief adviser, which is the equivalent to a prime minister, in the presence of diplomats, civil society members and top businessmen at the presidential palace in Dhaka.\n\nVeteran human rights advocate freed in swap says Russia is sliding back toward Stalinist times\n\nBERLIN (AP) -- A human rights activist since the 1980s, Oleg Orlov thought Russia had turned a corner when the Soviet Union collapsed and a democratically elected president became leader. But then Vladimir Putin rose to power, crushing dissent and launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Finally, the 71-year-old Orlov was himself thrown in prison for opposing the war. Freed last week in the largest East-West prisoner swap since the Cold War, Orlov told The Associated Press that Russia is backsliding toward the days of dictator Josef Stalin. He is vowing to work from exile to try to free as many political prisoners as possible and keep their cases in the spotlight.\n\nUS and other frustrated mediators call on Israel, Hamas to resume Gaza talks, saying, 'no excuses'\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaders of the United States, Egypt and Qatar are jointly demanding that Israel and Hamas return to stalled talks on the war in Gaza. The three leaders issued a statement Thursday saying \"only the details\" remain to get a cease-fire deal and hostage release. President Joe Biden, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Emir Tamim al-Thani of Qatar are signaling growing frustration, saying they would accept \"no excuses from any party for further delay.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Thursday that it had agreed to attend the Aug. 15 talks. There was no immediate word from Hamas. Hamas' top representative to the talks was killed July 31 in an assassination widely blamed on Israel.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley

The city of Ferguson, the St. Louis region, Missouri, and the United States would never be the same.\n\nBrown's death sparked both protests and demonstrations that quickly spread across the country and overseas, and helped lead to the creation of the Black Lives Matter movement. The protests in Ferguson turned violent and the city put a curfew in place. Tensions eased after a few weeks, then flared up again in November when a grand jury cleared Wilson of any wrongdoing in Brown's death.\n\nJust as some politicians were criticized for their response to Ferguson, like then-Governor Jay Nixon, others in the grassroots later made their way to politics. Congresswoman Cori Bush was active in protests then and was endorsed in her latest run by Michael Brown, Sr. The challenger who defeated her in Tuesday's primary election, Wesley Bell, told KMOX Radio in St. Louis that he has \"Ferguson City Council member\" on his resume.\n\n\"You know, what Ferguson taught me was how important it is to figure out ways, even when we disagree, to sit down and be able to work together,\" Bell said.\n\nBell was seen on the street, trying to lower the temperature between police and protesters.\n\n\"You know, I literally, at times, stood in between police and protesters to help calm tensions, because I recognized the only way we were going to move Ferguson and the region forward is by working together,\" he said.\n\nAt the time of the Ferguson protests, Bell was a municipal court judge in a nearby town and a community college professor.\n\nDeRay McKesson helped organize some of the protests back then. He now heads Campaign Zero, which advocates for policies designed to discourage violent responses by police officers. He told Missourinet that a 2015 law passed by the state legislature has helped, that limits how much revenue from traffic citations a city can include in its budget.\n\n\"The fines and fees work that emerged from the conversations, specifically in St. Louis County, because there were all these municipalities that were making a ton of money off of fining people a lot for very small things,\" McKesson said. \"That work changed so many things across the country.\"\n\nHe also said that more work needs to be done to reduce the threat of violent confrontations.\n\n\"It would be great for Missouri to do things at the state level, around limiting or banning neck restraints, around requiring officers actually to use de-escalation, like these sort of common sense things that are just not (state) law,\" McKesson said. \"Municipalities get to pick and choose (them).\"\n\nMissourinet also unsuccessfully reached out to the current mayor and police chief in Ferguson.", "source": {"uri": "missourinet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Missourinet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marshall_griffin@missourinet.com", "name": "Marshall Griffin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.missourinet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ferguson-protests-courtesy-KMOX-and-Getty-Images.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803411", "eventUri": "eng-9803411", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

I was at work at my desk at the bank taking a break from banking customers struggling to pay their mortgages. I scrolled on my phone hoping to pass time on my favorite social media app at that time, Twitter. As I scrolled my timeline I came across an image that made me sit up in my seat. Those were the days long before a trigger warning or a sensitive warning. The image that I saw was somebody's baby lying in the street with a pool of blood staining and streaming across the cement beneath them. That baby, we would all learn within a matter of hours was Michael Brown Jr., and that street he was lying in was called Canfield Drive in Ferguson, Mo. Brown lost his life that day.\n\nThis image that I saw over and over again, forever stained in my memory, was a cultural assault that would lead to a formidable movement called Black Lives Matter.\n\nNo one demonstrated to the world that Black Lives Matter more than those in Ferguson, who were moved to protest in the streets and take brave, courageous actions to ensure that the world never forgot what they did to a Black young man for walking down the middle of the street. The courage it took for a community to share their power with each other inspired a generation of millions of people to take action -- and to never look back.\n\nTheir protest also inspired my own analysis, and what I was willing to do to demand justice. Ferguson organizers taught us all how to protest. The Women's March and the racial reckoning that occurred during the summer of 2020 would not have happened without the Ferguson uprising that resulted from Brown's death. For that, I believe we owe Ferguson organizers more than a thank you. The righteous rage demonstrated there was the quintessential action that led to America's long reckoning with the sins of its past, by creating the space for many movements to emerge that centralized conversations on race, class, and gender that are still shaping the world today.\n\nMy endless gratitude, admiration, respect, and love for Ferguson is forever. And I pray none of us ever forget.\n\nRead More: How Ferguson Woke Us Up\n\nTen years is a long time for most but an even longer time for those of us who know what it's like to lose someone -- or even yourself. Ten years ago, I found myself homeless, without purpose, and deeply desiring a new path forward. I thought that there was no other option for me but to suffer and become a shell of myself.\n\nI was deeply inspired by the people in Ferguson who looked like me and reminded me of my family -- the community that used their voices to declare \"Hands Up, Don't Shoot\" as a rallying cry in response to the actions of an officer who saw Black life as disposable. It was the voices of the protestors in Ferguson that reminded me that I may have been without a home, but I was not without a voice. It's that voice that has carried me far and wide, from the White House and to communities across this country who lacked resources and support much like I did 10 years ago.\n\nFerguson inspired me to never give up and to never let anyone get in the way of creating what I knew was necessary to support myself and my community. Many would have me believe that being Black, poor, and transgender meant there was no space for me. And had I not seen women staring down armored trucks and millions of people taking to social media to join in dismay, anger, and sorrow, I probably would've believed the same. Ferguson taught me and that there was no space I didn't belong. The only spaces I could not align with were the spaces that did not believe in the humanity of all Black people. There was no compromise on this for me.\n\nThis realization led to me founding the nation's leading Black trans-founded organization exclusively dedicated to protecting and defending Black transgender lives, The Marsha P. Johnson Institute. We were born out of the rage and sorrow of Ferguson. We were born out of the rage and sorrow that grows from learning the ever-expanding list of unarmed Black people wrongly killed.\n\nI remember who I was before I knew so many names and stories of injustices. I remember who I was before The Marsha P. Johnson Institute. And I remember who I was before Ferguson. I was young, free, lost, afraid, but optimistic that the world believed in young Black people like me. However, over the last 10 years I've learned to question that truth. With an increase in anti-trans legislation and the regular occurrence of unjust killings of unarmed Black people, such as Sonya Massey most recently, we are constantly reminded that are fight is still ongoing.\n\nRead More: Policing's Illusion of Safety\n\nI'll always remember that Ferguson saved me and gave me a model for all that I could be as an organizer, and more importantly as a Black woman. Although there have been many sleepless nights filled with anxiety and doubt, coupled by numerous tragic losses -- including several murders and deaths of activists I looked up to and whose insights will forever guide me -- I've never forgotten that the Black imagination of Ferguson led a resistance movement that changed the way we talked about politics and race in America. So much so that unprecedented firsts are still happening today -- like Vice President Kamala Harris announcing her run the presidency.\n\nGreat efforts have been made to interrupt the power of a community like Ferguson, and its influence on people like me who need a reminder that our lives in fact did matter. That we should fight like hell to preserve them. And that we didn't and wouldn't have to fight alone.\n\nThe Black imagination is what fueled us all to join Ferguson in the streets and in our own communities -- to take action as we learned more and more names of Black people murdered by the police. It is the Black imagination that led me to believe that despite how awful the outcomes continue to be, we as the people who bear witness to these atrocities are indebted to Ferguson organizers for extending their humanity to us all by taking brave action to hold the police accountable for their wrongdoings.\n\nFerguson sparked an inextinguishable flame. In it, we saw ourselves more fully. And that ignited a global movement to encourage communities to pursue freedom, safety, and justice for all. I am because we are. I am because of Ferguson, Mo.

But the events from 10 years ago still served as a catalyst for change in Ferguson -- and beyond.\n\n\"What made me think it could and would change was the people in the streets in Ferguson in 2014,\" Blake Strode, the executive director of ArchCity Defenders told Morning Edition.\n\nFerguson isn't the same place it was 10 years ago, and many people who call it home are trying to make it better.\n\nMichael Brown's killing led to a Department of Justice investigation of the shooting and Ferguson's police department.\n\nThe DOJ found that the Ferguson police department was incentivized and encouraged to lobby municipal fines and fees on individuals to generate revenue for the city and that these fines disproportionately were issued to Black people in the city.\n\n\"Even relatively routine misconduct by Ferguson police officers can have significant consequences for the people whose rights are violated,\" the 100-page report read.\n\n\"I think what people here have known to be true for a very long time is that the institutions like the police and surveil, arrest and target people. I think they knew that on Aug. 9, 2014, and they know that now,\" said Strode of ArchCity Defenders. This legal advocacy organization was the first to raise the alarm about the fines and fees system in Ferguson.\n\nArchCity Defenders has seen a significant decrease in the amount of fines and fees issued to residents in Ferguson and the surrounding municipalities. In 2013, municipal court revenues in the Saint Louis region were about $61 million in 2023.\n\nLast year, that figure was $17.8 million.\n\n\"When we talk to our clients, many of them talk about the night and day experience of moving, working and traveling through their neighborhoods, their municipalities, their hometowns,\" Strode told Morning Edition.\n\nThe DOJ issued a federal consent decree in 2016 to the Ferguson Police Department after its investigation, requiring the department to adhere to mandates in order to reform their police system. Those included police training for officers, more community engagement and performance evaluations for officers.\n\n\"When I got here, officers were still walking around with their heads down, because they felt like just over the years, they continue to get beat up, you know, in the public in regards to what took place in 2014,\" Ferguson Chief of Police Troy Doyle told NPR's Michel Martin in his office.\n\nDoyle became Ferguson's police chief last year. The city has had a string of police chiefs since former Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown in 2014.\n\nBefore he was named police chief, Doyle spent 31 years in the St. Louis County Police Department. He retired from his position as Lieutenant Colonel two years after filing a racial discrimination lawsuit against another officer at the St. Louis County police department.\n\nDoyle points to programs he's implemented when talking about how the police department has improved. There have also been significant changes in the racial makeup of the police department: 10 years ago, there were only three Black police officers in Ferguson. Now, roughly half the police force in Ferguson is Black, he said.\n\nEven the police uniforms have changed.\n\n\"When you see the old Ferguson police cars or uniforms and also get out of the car, trigger some people in our community, \"Doyle said. \"So I wanted to get totally away from that.\"\n\nDoyle is hoping that the police department will be completely compliant with the federal consent decree in the next two years.\n\n\"When you're in the position I am as a chief of police, I am the final decision here at this police department,\" Doyle said. \"So that's where my optimism comes from, because I can set the tone in the practices that would take place here at this police department.\"\n\nBut activists like Strode think that no matter how much police reform is done, there are systemic problems in St. Louis that prevent meaningful change. The biggest one is the fact that the county is composed of small municipalities, each with their own police force, courts and standards for operating.\n\nUnlike fines and fees, the amount municipalities have increased in the last 10 years: there are now 84 municipalities in St. Louis. They were 81 in 2014.\n\n\"It's just a system that no one would design unless you were actually trying to profit from poor people,\" Strode said.\n\nStrode believes that consolidating the municipalities under one court system and police force would greatly reduce the amount of over policing in these areas by forcing the system to stop focusing on generating revenue.\n\n\"People would live much better, freer lives if we didn't have this kind of petty policing of their activities day in and day out,\" Strode said.\n\nBut Doyle thinks smaller police departments are an advantage.\n\n\"Some cities like to have a smaller police department because they feel more intimate with the officers that work there,\" Doyle said.\n\nThe day after QuikTrip, a gas station less than a mile away from where Michael Brown was killed, burned down, Michael McMillan, the president of the Urban League in St. Louis called Michael Johnson, the only Black person on the board of directors at QuikTrip.\n\n\"I said, Michael, you can't just let this be vacant, abandoned, derelict. This is going to be an eyesore and it's going to be a source of decay,\" McMillan said.\n\nMcMillan recalls talking to Johnson every day about what could be done with the empty lot. QuikTrip didn't plan to rebuild the gas station, so it decided to donate the space to the Urban League and Salvation Army, who were interested in opening a community center. It was the first time ever the Urban League, which is over 100 years old, had ever taken on owning and building a center.\n\n\"It pushed me and the team at the Urban League to do things that we had never done before because they needed to be done,\" McMillan said.\n\nThe Urban League's headquarters are in East St. Louis, closer to the heart of the city. McMillan says that the Urban League never thought a lot about poverty in the suburbs of the city until the death of Michael Brown, which brought attention to the high amounts of poverty in suburban areas near the edges of cities like St. Louis.\n\n\"If you look at the inner city, there's a huge amount of non-profit social service agencies,\" McMillan said. \"And people didn't really think that you needed to expand that much into North County.\"\n\nNPR met McMillan in his office at the Ferguson Community Empowerment Center, which opened in 2017 on the site of the QuikTrip that burned. The center is a multipurpose facility that serves as the headquarters for things like workforce programs for Black men, emergency assistance services and after school programs for kids.\n\n\"The center is for opportunity and new beginnings,\" said LaKeysha Fields, the St Louis Regional Social Services Director for the Salvation Army.\n\nAnd it's not the only new nonprofit in the area: there's also a senior living center where an AutoZone once stood, and a Boys and Girls Club less than a mile away from where Michael Brown was shot. The Urban League also broke ground on another project recently: it plans to turn two vacant lots into a plaza, anchored by a bank and a small convention center.\n\nStill, many lots sit vacant, as do abandoned apartments and boarded up buildings all throughout West Florissant Avenue, the main street in the city.\n\n\"I'm very hopeful that we can kind of plateau and rebuild and bring more businesses, institutions, you know, commercial activity on this major corridor,\" McMillan said. \"And then as a result, maybe people see the revitalization and want to rent in some of these apartment complexes and buy homes.\"\n\nNone of these new organizations had a large presence in the Ferguson area before 2014, but now they are some of the first things people see when they drive down West Florissant Avenue.\n\n\"I don't know that this building being here would have prevented what happened. Hopefully there would have been some buffer, less likelihood,\" Fields said.\n\nNPR spoke to some Ferguson residents and asked how they feel their city has changed.\n\nHenry Jones, Ollie Brown and Willy Powell, whom NPR met at a city park, all said they feel like things have especially improved in Ferguson's police department.\n\nWhile they might feel safer than they did a decade ago, all three of them agreed that there was more to be done, specifically for kids in the area who can often be victims and perpetrators of violence.\n\n\"We're watching them and they are like a train out of control,\" Brown said.\n\nBut they don't think that's a change that can happen with more policing.\n\n\"Police can't control them,\" Powell said. \"It starts in the home.\"\n\nThe point that reform goes beyond policing is what activist DeRay Mckesson, who became a well-known figure after the Ferguson protests in 2014, has argued for years. Mckesson now runs Campaign Zero, a social justice organization that works to reduce the power and reliance on police.\n\nThe group, he said, is working to highlight and change laws that can lead to more encounters with law enforcement and to reduce ways that formerly incarcerated people can get tangled up with the legal system again.\n\nHe pushes back against the notion that some reform hasn't happened.\n\n\"I do think there's a weird thing that happened where there are people who want this narrative that nothing has changed,\" Mckesson said.\n\nHe points to the attempt to pass the George Floyd Policing Act in Congress, new state laws prohibiting police from executing no-knock raids in Pennsylvania and new requirements for police departments to hand over data as signs of progress in police reform.\n\nThough national scale reform for the nearly 18,000 police departments in the United States hasn't happened, McKesson doesn't feel like solutions to issues in policing can come from the federal government.\n\n\"I think that people have been looking for something like a national silver bullet as opposed to understanding that the best version of the change will be a 50-state strategy,\" McKesson said.", "source": {"uri": "wfae.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFAE 90.7 - Charlotte's NPR News Source"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Burch writes about race and identity and spent time in Ferguson, Mo., to report on the 10th anniversary of Michael Brown's death.\n\nWhen Michael Brown Jr., an unarmed Black teenager, was fatally shot in 2014 by a white police officer and his body left in the street under the August sun, the small St. Louis suburb of Ferguson roiled and plunged into crisis.\n\nCommunity grief, long-simmering fury and distrust of government gave way to waves of protests that continued for months. There were violent confrontations between protesters and heavily armed law enforcement officers. A neighborhood convenience store was looted and burned to the ground. The protests drew activists from across the nation, amplified the national Black Lives Matter movement and fueled larger questions about race in America.\n\nAnd at a more grass-roots level, it created a political incubator of emerging local leaders: A new generation of young protesters who came of age during the Ferguson uprising have found ways to chip away at the racial disparities in Ferguson and nearby St. Louis, shifting from protests to politics and policies.\n\nSince Mr. Brown's death, Ferguson elected its first Black mayor. The police chief and more than half of the police officers are Black. And St. Louis County elected its first Black prosecutor.\n\n\"Ferguson gave birth to all kinds of young people who were committed to civil rights and social justice and representation,\" said Kimberly Norwood, a Washington University law professor and editor of \"Ferguson's Fault Lines: The Race Quake That Rocked a Nation.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Michael_Brown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Killing of Michael Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black Lives Matter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Convenience store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson_unrest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ferguson unrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_University_in_St._Louis", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington University in St. Louis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief of police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_County,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis County, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis County, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/09/multimedia/09nat-ferguson-ten-01-bwfg/09nat-ferguson-ten-01-bwfg-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803411", "eventUri": "eng-9803411", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

To that end, two days ago, on Aug. 7th in St. Louis, he and scholar and professor, Dr. Travis Harris, met with Brown Sr.\n\nMORE: Ferguson X: Mike Brown Should Be Here, Be 28, And Be Living His Best Life\n\nDr. Travis was living in Virginia and just beginning his graduate work at the College of William and Mary when the horror of August 9th - and the power of the uprising - unfolded. He traveled to Ferguson for the first time in October 2014 to lend his body, breath and brilliance to the national call to action by Tory in the fall of that year. He went back to finish his PhD, but his heart never really left Ferguson and over the years, he built deep relationships, including with Tory and Mike Brown Sr.\n\n\"He's a soft-spoken, quiet man,\" Tory told NewsOne about Brown Sr.\n\n\"I asked him if he thought that it could be his son laying there in that street,\" Dr. Travis said in a voice that was equal parts calm and brimming with emotion.\n\nMr. Brown paused, but only slightly, and then answered: \"I always thought it would be me.\"\n\nTory said, \"Me too. That's why I do this work. I always thought it would be me laying there. But when they killed one of our children, I knew exactly what I needed to commit my life to.\"\n\nWith love, grace, hope and gratitude, here is Ferguson X: NewsOne's conversation with Mike Brown Sr.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\n'The Work That Remains': Ben Crump Commemorates Michael Brown's Life 10 Years Later With A Call To Action\n\nMichael Brown And The Legacy Of Police Violence In Black Communities\n\nThe post Ferguson X: A Conversation With Mike Brown Sr. appeared first on NewsOne.\n\nFerguson X: A Conversation With Mike Brown Sr. was originally published on newsone.com", "source": {"uri": "blackamericaweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Black America Web"}, "authors": [{"uri": "asha_bandele@blackamericaweb.com", "name": "Asha Bandele", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Brown_(basketball,_born_1970)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Brown (basketball, born 1970)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Brown_(British_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Brown (British politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Post-Dispatch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capital punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_William_&_Mary", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College of William & Mary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horror fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_One", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Urban One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Crump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Crump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Earth_Lights", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Earth Lights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Biography", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Biography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://newsone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2021/03/16164448703585.jpg?w=640&strip=all&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803411", "eventUri": "eng-9803411", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-08-09", "textStart": 204, "textEnd": 220}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 610, "textEnd": 618}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 908, "textEnd": 918}, {"amb": false, "date": "2014-10-", "textStart": 1009, "textEnd": 1021}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Long enough for the media to gather and the news to spread.\n\nAnd long enough for a spark of rage over yet another unarmed Black man being killed by police to ignite and spread throughout the city of Ferguson.\n\nMike Brown's killing - and the hundreds of days of sustained protest that followed - helped strengthen the Black Lives Matter movement and brought the issue of police use of force against unarmed Black Americans to the forefront of US policy and politics like never before. But a decade later, the nation's progress toward preventing such a killing has remained frustratingly slow.\n\nAnd for Brown's family, the ensuing years have done little to transmute the pain of losing the brother and son they affectionally called \"Mike Mike.\"\n\nOn Friday, Michael Brown Sr., and his wife, Cal Brown, will walk the four and half miles from the high school where their son graduated just days before he was killed through the streets of Ferguson to the place they call \"ground zero\" - the rugged patch of asphalt where the teenager laid that remains untouched despite the years.\n\n\"I am still struggling,\" Mike Brown Sr., said during an appearance on a St. Louis faith leader and talk show host's social media channel earlier this week. \"I definitely get a lot of my justice through my work with my foundation, so that's what keeps me uplifted.\"\n\nCNN has reached out to the Brown family for comment.\n\nThe march is meant to be a call to action to continue the fight against police excessive use of force and is part of the family's weeklong tribute to the young man Mike Brown was and could have been.\n\n\"People overlook a grieving family,\" Cal Brown said the appearance, \"because death has become so normalized ... Ten years ago, Mike Brown Jr., was not the first, nor was he the last.\"\n\nSay their names\n\nBefore Michael Brown, there was Eric Garner. Each name is added to an inauspicious roll call of the Black men and women killed at the hands of police that stretches back generations.\n\nSonya Massey's name was added to that list in July. She's among the more than 1,100 people who have been shot and killed by police in the last 12 months alone, according to a database of fatal police encounters created and maintained by the Washington Post.\n\nThe Post's data relies on media reports, some law enforcement records and social media to aggregate the death toll because there's no federal law requiring police departments report the number of encounters that end in fatalities to the government.\n\nAs a result, according to the Post, the death toll is widely thought to be undercounted.\n\n\"We're in a moment where we're seeing history repeat itself, or at least a rhyme, and rhyme and rhyme, and rhyme,\" said Phillip Solomon, a professor of African American studies and psychology at Yale.\n\nSolomon said he was inspired to study the issue of racism in policing in part because of the 1999 killing of Amadou Diallo. The 23-year-old West African immigrant was shot 41 times by plainclothes New York City police officers while standing in the entryway to his apartment.\n\nDiallo was unarmed. The officers who killed him were later acquitted.\n\n\"For a generation of folks, they grew up post-Trayvon, post-Mike Brown and Ferguson, and they saw what wasn't working and they got frustrated and impatient,\" Solomon said.\n\nCalls to abolish or defund the police surged after the 2020 death of George Floyd, but they have since lost traction and Solomon said that same impatient generation has begun to ask, \"What now?\"\n\n\"That question to me is one of the most energizing, optimistic things that's happening because there is moral certainty that if we want to call police 'public safety,' we're doing public safety all the way wrong,\" he said.\n\nSolomon co-founded the Center for Policing Equity, which uses data and science to try find a way to make policing in America \"less racist and less deadly,\" according to the organization's website.\n\nBut the weight of each person killed by police lands like a boulder, Solomon said. And making progress, he said, is like trying to tip the scale using only feathers - especially as the political will to pass legislation like the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act has dwindled over the years.\n\n\"As a nation, we're not built for a long-term project of undoing the racism, not just in policing but in all the systems that end up in policing,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't see a point in my lifetime where there won't be boulders,\" he added. \"I think what we can do is we can pay real close attention to the feathers.\"\n\nSome reason to hope, but progress is slow\n\nThe Ferguson Police Department no longer looks as it did in 2014.\n\nBack then, the department had around 60 officers and fewer than five were African American, Ferguson Police Chief Troy Doyle told CNN.\n\n\"Now, as we sit here in August of 2024, we have right at about 50% African American representation and along with that we have about a 23% female representation,\" he said.\n\nDoyle said Brown's killing and the ensuing protests have left a lasting impact on the department and their approach to policing.\n\nThe department remains under a 2016 federal consent decree that was put in place after the Department of Justice issued a scathing report that found the city's officers and court system had engaged in a \"pattern and practice\" of discrimination against African Americans, targeting them disproportionately for traffic stops, use of force and jail sentences.\n\nUnder the decree, Ferguson officers have undergone trainings on implicit bias, crisis intervention and the use of force, Doyle said. Out of the more than 30,000 calls the department received in 2023, the police chief said fewer than 1% resulted in a use of force.\n\n\"Which tells me that the provisions in the consent decree, along with the training that my officers are receiving, that (the officers are) buying into this new form of policing, and it's working,\" Doyle said.\n\nThe consent decree also requires an independent monitoring team to issue reports on the department's progress toward reform. According to the monitor's most recent report, \"the city's progress toward compliance with the Consent Decree largely stalled during 2022 and into 2023,\" due in part to turn over in the city's police and fire department, but the department remains committed to complying.\n\nDoyle said ultimately, his goal as chief is to engage with Ferguson's community so his department is seen as a \"legitimate, effective, professional law enforcement agency.\"\n\n\"With that in mind, we also got to remember that police officers are hired from the human race,\" Doyle said. \"That means there are going to be occasions where mistakes are made and unfortunately, our goal and our job is to minimize those mistakes.\"\n\nA humble battle cry\n\nDarren Wilson, the officer who shot and killed Mike Brown, never faced criminal charges for killing the teenager.\n\nSolomon said he believes one the reasons the country has yet meaningfully address the issue of police killings is because \"we literally have not responded in the basic human way to the simple articulation: Please allow Black lives to matter.\"\n\nHe said there are specific policies that could have been put in place to prevent the deaths of Brown or someone like Massey, but there's a lack of political will.\n\n\"It's the humblest battle cry and motto you could possibly imagine, 'Hey, I'd like it if you treated me like my life mattered.' But there is an entire political machine right now dedicated to ... turning their activism into the most radical, seedy, violent criminal behavior,\" Solomon said.\n\nShortly after his son's death, Michael Brown Sr., started an eponymous organization called \"Chosen for Change,\" where he and his family have spent the last decade reaching out to fathers and families who have experienced traumatic loss.\n\nBrown Sr., acknowledged the Ferguson police department has made progress over the years, but he compared the changes to a \"rebrand.\"\n\n\"They've tried to do different things, bodycams, don't stop and frisk no more,\" he said during the social media interview earlier this week. \"It's just a lot of cancer in this system that they can't just change faces right now, they have to change the whole system.\"\n\n\"You can't erase what happened here. It's history.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

According to the monitor's most recent report, \"the city's progress toward compliance with the Consent Decree largely stalled during 2022 and into 2023,\" due in part to turn over in the city's police and fire department, but the department remains committed to complying.\n\nDoyle said ultimately, his goal as chief is to engage with Ferguson's community so his department is seen as a \"legitimate, effective, professional law enforcement agency.\"\n\n\"With that in mind, we also got to remember that police officers are hired from the human race,\" Doyle said. \"That means there are going to be occasions where mistakes are made and unfortunately, our goal and our job is to minimize those mistakes.\"\n\nMichael Brown Sr. comforts his wife Cal Brown during a memorial service marking the one year anniversary of his son's death on August 9, 2015.\n\nScott Olson/Getty Images\n\nA humble battle cry\n\nDarren Wilson, the officer who shot and killed Mike Brown, never faced criminal charges for killing the teenager.\n\nSolomon said he believes one the reasons the country has yet meaningfully address the issue of police killings is because \"we literally have not responded in the basic human way to the simple articulation: Please allow Black lives to matter.\"\n\nHe said there are specific policies that could have been put in place to prevent the deaths of Brown or someone like Massey, but there's a lack of political will.\n\n\"It's the humblest battle cry and motto you could possibly imagine, 'Hey, I'd like it if you treated me like my life mattered.' But there is an entire political machine right now dedicated to ... turning their activism into the most radical, seedy, violent criminal behavior,\" Solomon said.\n\nShortly after his son's death, Michael Brown Sr., started an eponymous organization called \"Chosen for Change,\" where he and his family have spent the last decade reaching out to fathers and families who have experienced traumatic loss.\n\nBrown Sr., acknowledged the Ferguson police department has made progress over the years, but he compared the changes to a \"rebrand.\"\n\n\"They've tried to do different things, bodycams, don't stop and frisk no more,\" he said during the social media interview earlier this week. \"It's just a lot of cancer in this system that they can't just change faces right now, they have to change the whole system.\"\n\n\"You can't erase what happened here. It's history.\"\n\nCNN's Evan Perez contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chelsea_bailey@cnn.com", "name": "Chelsea Bailey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_E._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael E.

(AP) -- Debby's final chapter involves moving north and northeast from the Carolinas at a faster clip with soaking rains, flash flooding and the threat of tornadoes into the weekend. Accuweather's chief meteorologist Jon Porter said the Mid-Atlantic states and parts of New York and New England will see significant rainfall that could cause dangerous flooding into the weekend, such as on parts of Interstate 95 near bigger cities. From eastern Virginia up to Vermont, an active stretch of tornadoes was also possible on Friday. Tornadoes spawned by Debby have leveled homes, damaged a school and killed one person. The tropical storm was downgraded to a tropical depression Thursday afternoon.\n\nFerguson marks 10 years since Michael Brown's death. While there's some progress, challenges persist\n\nFERGUSON, Mo. (AP) -- Michael Brown's death was the catalyst for massive change starting in Ferguson, Missouri. Ten years later, those in the community cite significant progress, but say challenges remain. Every city leader was white in the majority-Black city in 2014. Today, the mayor, police chief, city attorney and other leaders are Black. The mostly-white police force of 2014 now has more officers that are Black than white. The municipal court system that once brought in millions of dollars in court fines and fees paid mostly by poor residents now collects only a fraction of that. But many acknowledge that race still divides the community of 18,000 residents.\n\nTimeline of events in Ferguson, Missouri, after a police officer fatally shot Michael Brown\n\nFERGUSON, Mo. (AP) -- On Aug. 9, 2014, Michael Brown and a friend were walking in the middle of Canfield Drive, a two-lane street in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Missouri, when a police officer drove by and told them to use the sidewalk. After words were exchanged, the white officer confronted the 18-year-old Brown, who was Black. The situation escalated, with the officer and Brown scuffling. The officer shot and killed Brown, who was unarmed. Months of unrest followed. Friday marks the 10th anniversary of the shooting that was a pivotal moment in the national Black Lives Matter movement, and helped spur a reckoning of how Black people in Ferguson and elsewhere in the St. Louis region were treated by police and the courts.\n\nHarris and Walz head to Arizona, where a VP runner-up could still make a difference\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate are campaigning in Arizona as the latest stop on their tour of battleground states. The Arizona swing is especially significant because Harris passed over the state's junior senator, Mark Kelly, in favor of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate. That may cost her a handful of votes in a state that President Joe Biden won by less than 11,000 votes in 2020. But the state is also chock full of Midwesterners who may warm to Walz. And Democrats say the same energy that's greeted Harris at earlier stops on her battleground tour is present in Arizona.\n\nA win for the Harris-Walz ticket would also mean the country's first Native American female governor\n\nIf Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz officially steps down later this year to accept the position of U.S. vice president, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan would become the first Native woman to govern a state. Flanagan is a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe and became the highest ranking Native American statewide official in the country when she was elected to office in 2018. She has helped shape Walz's administration as one focused on improving tribal sovereignty and autonomy across Minnesota. She is one of several Indigenous women who have taken seats of power in the U.S. over the past decade, and many in Indian Country see her rise to power as an opportunity for increased Indigenous rights and visibility.\n\nTrump recommits to a Sept. 10 debate and lashes out at Harris at news conference\n\nPALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Donald Trump has recommitted to debating Vice President Kamala Harris after recently backing out. The Republican presidential nominee held a lengthy news conference Thursday in which he taunted his new rival, boasted of his crowd on Jan. 6, 2021, and lashed out at questions about the enthusiasm her campaign has been generating. As he addressed reporters at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, ABC announced that Trump and Harris have agreed to a Sept. 10 presidential debate. In taking questions from reporters for more than an hour, Trump tried to draw a contrast with Harris, who has not held a news conference since she became the likely Democratic nominee following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race.\n\n3rd person in custody over foiled plot targeting now-canceled Taylor Swift shows in Vienna\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- A third teenager arrested in connection with a foiled plot to attack three Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna pledged an \"oath of allegiance\" to the Islamic State group, an Austrian official said Friday. Austrian Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said an 18-year-old was taken into custody Thursday evening in Vienna after allegedly being in contact with the main suspect. Karner announced the 18-year-old's arrest during an unrelated news conference Friday. \"He had been in contact with the main perpetrator, but is not directly connected to the attack plans,\" Karner said. \"But, as was found out a few days ago, he took an oath of allegiance specifically to the IS on Aug. 6.\"\n\nInterim leader Muhammad Yunus takes the helm in Bangladesh, to seek peace and prepare elections\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus has taken the oath of office to lead Bangladesh's interim government after protests forced out Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina this week. The key tasks for Yunus now are restoring peace in the South Asian country and preparing for new elections following the ouster of Hasina, who fled to India after student protests over job quotas grew into an uprising against her increasingly autocratic 15-year rule. The figurehead president administered the oath to Yunus for his role as chief adviser, which is the equivalent to a prime minister, in the presence of diplomats, civil society members and top businessmen at the presidential palace in Dhaka.\n\nVeteran human rights advocate freed in swap says Russia is sliding back toward Stalinist times\n\nBERLIN (AP) -- A human rights activist since the 1980s, Oleg Orlov thought Russia had turned a corner when the Soviet Union collapsed and a democratically elected president became leader. But then Vladimir Putin rose to power, crushing dissent and launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Finally, the 71-year-old Orlov was himself thrown in prison for opposing the war. Freed last week in the largest East-West prisoner swap since the Cold War, Orlov told The Associated Press that Russia is backsliding toward the days of dictator Josef Stalin. He is vowing to work from exile to try to free as many political prisoners as possible and keep their cases in the spotlight.\n\nUS and other frustrated mediators call on Israel, Hamas to resume Gaza talks, saying, 'no excuses'\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaders of the United States, Egypt and Qatar are jointly demanding that Israel and Hamas return to stalled talks on the war in Gaza. The three leaders issued a statement Thursday saying \"only the details\" remain to get a cease-fire deal and hostage release. President Joe Biden, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Emir Tamim al-Thani of Qatar are signaling growing frustration, saying they would accept \"no excuses from any party for further delay.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Thursday that it had agreed to attend the Aug. 15 talks. There was no immediate word from Hamas. Hamas' top representative to the talks was killed July 31 in an assassination widely blamed on Israel.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors":

She is the founder and executive director of the Marsha P. Johnson Institute, an organization committed to advocating for human rights for Black trans people.\n\nI can still remember where I was on August 9th, 2014. I was at work at my desk at the bank taking a break from banking customers struggling to pay their mortgages. I scrolled on my phone hoping to pass time on my favorite social media app at that time, Twitter. As I scrolled my timeline I came across an image that made me sit up in my seat. Those were the days long before a trigger warning or a sensitive warning. The image that I saw was somebody's baby lying in the street with a pool of blood staining and streaming across the cement beneath them. That baby, we would all learn within a matter of hours was Michael Brown Jr., and that street he was lying in was called Canfield Drive in Ferguson, Mo. Brown lost his life that day.\n\nThis image that I saw over and over again, forever stained in my memory, was a cultural assault that would lead to a formidable movement called Black Lives Matter.\n\nNo one demonstrated to the world that Black Lives Matter more than those in Ferguson, who were moved to protest in the streets and take brave, courageous actions to ensure that the world never forgot what they did to a Black young man for walking down the middle of the street. The courage it took for a community to share their power with each other inspired a generation of millions of people to take action -- and to never look back.\n\nTheir protest also inspired my own analysis, and what I was willing to do to demand justice. Ferguson organizers taught us all how to protest. The Women's March and the racial reckoning that occurred during the summer of 2020 would not have happened without the Ferguson uprising that resulted from Brown's death. For that, I believe we owe Ferguson organizers more than a thank you. The righteous rage demonstrated there was the quintessential action that led to America's long reckoning with the sins of its past, by creating the space for many movements to emerge that centralized conversations on race, class, and gender that are still shaping the world today.\n\nMy endless gratitude, admiration, respect, and love for Ferguson is forever. And I pray none of us ever forget.\n\nRead More: How Ferguson Woke Us Up\n\nTen years is a long time for most but an even longer time for those of us who know what it's like to lose someone -- or even yourself. Ten years ago, I found myself homeless, without purpose, and deeply desiring a new path forward. I thought that there was no other option for me but to suffer and become a shell of myself.\n\nI was deeply inspired by the people in Ferguson who looked like me and reminded me of my family -- the community that used their voices to declare \"Hands Up, Don't Shoot\" as a rallying cry in response to the actions of an officer who saw Black life as disposable. It was the voices of the protestors in Ferguson that reminded me that I may have been without a home, but I was not without a voice. It's that voice that has carried me far and wide, from the White House and to communities across this country who lacked resources and support much like I did 10 years ago.\n\nFerguson inspired me to never give up and to never let anyone get in the way of creating what I knew was necessary to support myself and my community. Many would have me believe that being Black, poor, and transgender meant there was no space for me. And had I not seen women staring down armored trucks and millions of people taking to social media to join in dismay, anger, and sorrow, I probably would've believed the same. Ferguson taught me and that there was no space I didn't belong. The only spaces I could not align with were the spaces that did not believe in the humanity of all Black people. There was no compromise on this for me.\n\nThis realization led to me founding the nation's leading Black trans-founded organization exclusively dedicated to protecting and defending Black transgender lives, The Marsha P. Johnson Institute. We were born out of the rage and sorrow of Ferguson. We were born out of the rage and sorrow that grows from learning the ever-expanding list of unarmed Black people wrongly killed.\n\nI remember who I was before I knew so many names and stories of injustices. I remember who I was before The Marsha P. Johnson Institute. And I remember who I was before Ferguson. I was young, free, lost, afraid, but optimistic that the world believed in young Black people like me. However, over the last 10 years I've learned to question that truth. With an increase in anti-trans legislation and the regular occurrence of unjust killings of unarmed Black people, such as Sonya Massey most recently, we are constantly reminded that are fight is still ongoing.\n\nRead More: Policing's Illusion of Safety\n\nI'll always remember that Ferguson saved me and gave me a model for all that I could be as an organizer, and more importantly as a Black woman. Although there have been many sleepless nights filled with anxiety and doubt, coupled by numerous tragic losses -- including several murders and deaths of activists I looked up to and whose insights will forever guide me -- I've never forgotten that the Black imagination of Ferguson led a resistance movement that changed the way we talked about politics and race in America. So much so that unprecedented firsts are still happening today -- like Vice President Kamala Harris announcing her run the presidency.\n\nGreat efforts have been made to interrupt the power of a community like Ferguson, and its influence on people like me who need a reminder that our lives in fact did matter. That we should fight like hell to preserve them. And that we didn't and wouldn't have to fight alone.\n\nThe Black imagination is what fueled us all to join Ferguson in the streets and in our own communities -- to take action as we learned more and more names of Black people murdered by the police. It is the Black imagination that led me to believe that despite how awful the outcomes continue to be, we as the people who bear witness to these atrocities are indebted to Ferguson organizers for extending their humanity to us all by taking brave action to hold the police accountable for their wrongdoings.\n\nFerguson sparked an inextinguishable flame. In it, we saw ourselves more fully. And that ignited a global movement to encourage communities to pursue freedom, safety, and justice for all. I am because we are. I am because of Ferguson, Mo.

Thomas / Getty\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump commemorated the life and death of Michael Brown Jr. on Friday -- 10 years since the tragic police shooting death of the 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri -- with a call to action in the name of social justice and reforming law enforcement.\n\nCrump was the attorney representing Brown's family -- Michael Brown Sr. and Lesley McSpadden -- and their fight for justice after now-former Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson gunned down their loved one with six fatal shots on Aug. 9, 2014. The shooting led to what's been called the Ferguson Uprising, a series of protests that began the day after Brown Jr.'s death and also contributed to the rise of the national, powerful and highly influential Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nMORE: The Night Ferguson Erupted\n\nCrump, a longtime advocate for consequences for police misconduct who has been retained to work on some of the biggest social justice cases in modern history -- including Trayvon Martin's brutal shooting death by a vigilante in Florida in 2013 and George Floyd's police murder in Minneapolis in 2020 -- on Friday marked the somber anniversary in part by recalling the effect that Brown Jr.'s death had not on just Black America, but also the U.S. at large.\n\n\"Ten years after the tragic death of Michael Brown, we are reminded of the profound impact his loss has had on the fight for justice and the movement for Black lives,\" Crump said in a statement that was shared with NewsOne. \"Michael's death was a catalyst for a racial reckoning in our society, particularly relating to law enforcement and their treatment of people of color. His memory compels us to keep fighting against the injustices that have plagued our communities for far too long.\"\n\nStill, Crump added, while much progress has been made, there is still quite a ways to go to ensure that Brown Jr. didn't die in vain.\n\n\"But while we reflect on the progress made, we must also acknowledge the work that remains,\" Crump continued. \"Michael's death, like the deaths of so many others, is a painful reminder of the urgent need for comprehensive reforms that ensure no other family has to endure the heartbreak of losing a loved one to police violence.\"\n\nCrump concluded his statement: \"Today, we honor Michael Brown's legacy by renewing our commitment to justice, equality, and the relentless pursuit of change. His life mattered, and his memory continues to fuel our resolve to build a world where Black lives are valued and protected.\"\n\nFerguson 10: Michael Brown Should Be Here, Be 28 And Be Living His Best Life\n\nMichael Brown And The Legacy Of Police Violence In Black Communities\n\nPhotographic Proof Not Much Has Changed In Ferguson Since Michael Brown's Death 0 photos", "source": {"uri": "newsone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News One"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Michael_Brown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Killing of Michael Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Crump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Crump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_One", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Urban One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ferguson, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ferguson, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_County,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis County, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis County, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clayton, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clayton, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigilantism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vigilantism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trayvon_Martin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trayvon Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson_unrest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ferguson unrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black Lives Matter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_misconduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police misconduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police brutality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Biography", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Biography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Athletes", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://newsone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2024/08/1723222711429.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=560&crop=0,0,100,320px", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803411", "eventUri": "eng-9803411", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-04-23", "textStart": 223, "textEnd": 237}, {"amb": false, "date": "2014-08-09", "textStart": 903, "textEnd": 915}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Debby's final chapter involves moving north and northeast from the Carolinas at a faster clip with soaking rains, flash flooding and the threat of tornadoes into the weekend. Accuweather's chief meteorologist Jon Porter said the Mid-Atlantic states and parts of New York and New England will see significant rainfall that could cause dangerous flooding into the weekend, such as on parts of Interstate 95 near bigger cities. From eastern Virginia up to Vermont, an active stretch of tornadoes was also possible on Friday. Tornadoes spawned by Debby have leveled homes, damaged a school and killed one person. The tropical storm was downgraded to a tropical depression Thursday afternoon.\n\nFerguson marks 10 years since Michael Brown's death. While there's some progress, challenges persist\n\nFERGUSON, Mo. (AP) -- Michael Brown's death was the catalyst for massive change starting in Ferguson, Missouri. Ten years later, those in the community cite significant progress, but say challenges remain. Every city leader was white in the majority-Black city in 2014. Today, the mayor, police chief, city attorney and other leaders are Black. The mostly-white police force of 2014 now has more officers that are Black than white. The municipal court system that once brought in millions of dollars in court fines and fees paid mostly by poor residents now collects only a fraction of that. But many acknowledge that race still divides the community of 18,000 residents.\n\nTimeline of events in Ferguson, Missouri, after a police officer fatally shot Michael Brown\n\nFERGUSON, Mo. (AP) -- On Aug. 9, 2014, Michael Brown and a friend were walking in the middle of Canfield Drive, a two-lane street in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Missouri, when a police officer drove by and told them to use the sidewalk. After words were exchanged, the white officer confronted the 18-year-old Brown, who was Black. The situation escalated, with the officer and Brown scuffling. The officer shot and killed Brown, who was unarmed. Months of unrest followed. Friday marks the 10th anniversary of the shooting that was a pivotal moment in the national Black Lives Matter movement, and helped spur a reckoning of how Black people in Ferguson and elsewhere in the St. Louis region were treated by police and the courts.\n\nHarris and Walz head to Arizona, where a VP runner-up could still make a difference\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate are campaigning in Arizona as the latest stop on their tour of battleground states. The Arizona swing is especially significant because Harris passed over the state's junior senator, Mark Kelly, in favor of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate. That may cost her a handful of votes in a state that President Joe Biden won by less than 11,000 votes in 2020. But the state is also chock full of Midwesterners who may warm to Walz. And Democrats say the same energy that's greeted Harris at earlier stops on her battleground tour is present in Arizona.\n\nA win for the Harris-Walz ticket would also mean the country's first Native American female governor\n\nIf Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz officially steps down later this year to accept the position of U.S. vice president, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan would become the first Native woman to govern a state. Flanagan is a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe and became the highest ranking Native American statewide official in the country when she was elected to office in 2018. She has helped shape Walz's administration as one focused on improving tribal sovereignty and autonomy across Minnesota. She is one of several Indigenous women who have taken seats of power in the U.S. over the past decade, and many in Indian Country see her rise to power as an opportunity for increased Indigenous rights and visibility.\n\nTrump recommits to a Sept. 10 debate and lashes out at Harris at news conference\n\nPALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Donald Trump has recommitted to debating Vice President Kamala Harris after recently backing out. The Republican presidential nominee held a lengthy news conference Thursday in which he taunted his new rival, boasted of his crowd on Jan. 6, 2021, and lashed out at questions about the enthusiasm her campaign has been generating. As he addressed reporters at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, ABC announced that Trump and Harris have agreed to a Sept. 10 presidential debate. In taking questions from reporters for more than an hour, Trump tried to draw a contrast with Harris, who has not held a news conference since she became the likely Democratic nominee following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race.\n\nInterim leader Muhammad Yunus takes the helm in Bangladesh, to seek peace and prepare elections\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus has taken the oath of office to lead Bangladesh's interim government after protests forced out Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina this week. The key tasks for Yunus now are restoring peace in the South Asian country and preparing for new elections following the ouster of Hasina, who fled to India after student protests over job quotas grew into an uprising against her increasingly autocratic 15-year rule. The figurehead president administered the oath to Yunus for his role as chief adviser, which is the equivalent to a prime minister, in the presence of diplomats, civil society members and top businessmen at the presidential palace in Dhaka.\n\nVeteran human rights advocate freed in swap says Russia is sliding back toward Stalinist times\n\nBERLIN (AP) -- A human rights activist since the 1980s, Oleg Orlov thought Russia had turned a corner when the Soviet Union collapsed and a democratically elected president became leader. But then Vladimir Putin rose to power, crushing dissent and launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Finally, the 71-year-old Orlov was himself thrown in prison for opposing the war. Freed last week in the largest East-West prisoner swap since the Cold War, Orlov told The Associated Press that Russia is backsliding toward the days of dictator Josef Stalin. He is vowing to work from exile to try to free as many political prisoners as possible and keep their cases in the spotlight.\n\nUS and other frustrated mediators call on Israel, Hamas to resume Gaza talks, saying, 'no excuses'\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaders of the United States, Egypt and Qatar are jointly demanding that Israel and Hamas return to stalled talks on the war in Gaza. The three leaders issued a statement Thursday saying \"only the details\" remain to get a cease-fire deal and hostage release. President Joe Biden, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Emir Tamim al-Thani of Qatar are signaling growing frustration, saying they would accept \"no excuses from any party for further delay.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Thursday that it had agreed to attend the Aug. 15 talks. There was no immediate word from Hamas. Hamas' top representative to the talks was killed July 31 in an assassination widely blamed on Israel.\n\nMaui remembers the 102 lost in the Lahaina wildfire with a paddle out 1 year after devastating blaze\n\nLAHAINA, Hawaii (AP) -- Dozens of Maui surfers, canoe paddlers and boat riders made their way into the ocean off Lahaina, Hawaii, on Thursday to remember the 102 people killed when the nation's deadliest wildfire in more than a century destroyed the historic town one year ago. The \"paddle out\" gathering is a ritual observed in Hawaii in honor of loved ones. Boat riders dropped flower petals in the sea while surfers splashed water in the air. Spectators watched from a beach park on shore. Hawaii Gov. Josh Green says Maui is still grieving for those lost in the Aug. 8, 2023, fire.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Family members announced a civil lawsuit over the death of Michael Brown Jr. in Ferguson, Missouri. | Source: Michael B. Thomas / Getty\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump commemorated the life and death of Michael Brown Jr. on Friday -- 10 years since the tragic police shooting death of the 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri -- with a call to action in the name of social justice and reforming law enforcement.\n\nCrump was the attorney representing Brown's family -- Michael Brown Sr. and Lesley McSpadden -- and their fight for justice after now-former Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson gunned down their loved one with six fatal shots on Aug. 9, 2014. The shooting led to what's been called the Ferguson Uprising, a series of protests that began the day after Brown Jr.'s death and also contributed to the rise of the national, powerful and highly influential Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nMORE: The Night Ferguson Erupted\n\nCrump, a longtime advocate for consequences for police misconduct who has been retained to work on some of the biggest social justice cases in modern history -- including Trayvon Martin's brutal shooting death by a vigilante in Florida in 2013 and George Floyd's police murder in Minneapolis in 2020 -- on Friday marked the somber anniversary in part by recalling the effect that Brown Jr.'s death had not on just Black America, but also the U.S. at large.\n\n\"Ten years after the tragic death of Michael Brown, we are reminded of the profound impact his loss has had on the fight for justice and the movement for Black lives,\" Crump said in a statement that was shared with NewsOne. \"Michael's death was a catalyst for a racial reckoning in our society, particularly relating to law enforcement and their treatment of people of color. His memory compels us to keep fighting against the injustices that have plagued our communities for far too long.\"\n\nStill, Crump added, while much progress has been made, there is still quite a ways to go to ensure that Brown Jr. didn't die in vain.\n\n\"But while we reflect on the progress made, we must also acknowledge the work that remains,\" Crump continued. \"Michael's death, like the deaths of so many others, is a painful reminder of the urgent need for comprehensive reforms that ensure no other family has to endure the heartbreak of losing a loved one to police violence.\"\n\nCrump concluded his statement: \"Today, we honor Michael Brown's legacy by renewing our commitment to justice, equality, and the relentless pursuit of change. His life mattered, and his memory continues to fuel our resolve to build a world where Black lives are valued and protected.\"\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nFerguson 10: Michael Brown Should Be Here, Be 28 And Be

They decided to return home, where she went to Ferguson to stand with protesters.\n\n\"The love that bound us then and that binds us now is perpetually evident and how people have committed to changing this city, to changing our communities, to changing this entire world,\" Packnett Cunningham said.\n\nOthers on the panel included Ferguson Mayor Ella Jones, Police Chief Troy Doyle, Clifton Kinnie, a teacher and activist who founded Our Destiny STL, and Zack Boyers, CEO of U.S. Bancorp Impact Finance.\n\nDoyle said his police department is working to comply with the terms of a federal consent decree that called for changes in police and city practices. He said that the department has implemented major changes since 2014, and that now more than half of its officers are African Americans. It also has seen a dramatic decrease in the use of force. Those changes occurred because people in Ferguson decided to protest, he said.\n\n\"If it wasn't for the protest movement, would police officers be wearing bodycams?\" Doyle said. \"If it wasn't for the protest movement, would we be involved in de-escalation training, crisis intervention training, and so on? Everything that we doing now, as far as reform, birthed from what took place here in the city of Ferguson.\"\n\nJones added that the community's relationship with police has changed dramatically in the past decade.\n\n\"If you want to know what's been happening here in the last 10 years, look at the different relationships that are being built, collaborative efforts that people who would never have stood beside each other are talking and serving together,\" Jones said.\n\nBut the panelists and several audience members said the progress made since Brown's death isn't enough. Some mentioned the continuing killings of Black people by police across the U.S., including George Floyd in Minneapolis and Sonya Massey, an unarmed woman killed last month by an officer in her Springfield, Illinois, home after calling police to report a potential prowler.\n\n\"The movement that we saw globally in 2020 in the name of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and so many others would not have happened in the way that it did if it were not for the 400-plus days of the Ferguson uprising,\" Cunningham said.\n\nShe said conversations around police reform need to include both justice and accountability.\n\n\"Justice is a living, breathing Michael Brown,\" she said. \"Justice is all of us at home watching Netflix right now because Michael Brown is living his life anonymously; his parents are sitting there having dinner with their son. Accountability would have been the officer that killed him being tried.\"\n\nA grand jury in 2014 declined to charge Darren Wilson, the then-Ferguson officer who shot Brown, and a review by the U.S. Department of Justice found that there was not enough evidence to take the case to trial.\n\nBoyers said the St. Louis region needs to address persistent inequities to improve the lives of people in different communities.\n\n\"One of the things that I and a number of us have learned over the last 10 years is the requirement that we maintain and sustain a level of urgency, and it is still required,\" Boyers said. \"To get to a place where outcomes, life outcomes, health, wealth, all of it is no longer predictable by race; we're not anywhere near there. We need to continue to sustain that commitment to urgency.\"\n\nKinnie said community leaders must engage young people and to help them become involved as participants and voters. He said that it's also important to listen to people who are upset about systemic problems in policing and government, and that collaboration is essential.\n\n\"We still have a fight. We're not done,\" Kinnie said. \"We all might not have the same ideologies, but one thing I think we all agree on in this room is that we have to figure out how to love each other.\"", "source": {"uri": "kcur.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KCUR 89.3 - NPR in Kansas City.

Word spread quickly in the tightly-knit St. Louis suburb that 'Mike Mike', who graduated high school days earlier, was dead.\n\nIt was 10 years ago that Michael was killed. His death sparked an outpouring of emotion and months of protests from Black Americans, desperate for an answer as to how another unarmed Black man could be killed by police.\n\nAuthorities responded to the demonstrations with militarised police, who shot rubber bullets and tear gassed protestors who had gathered. Witnesses said they targeted both peaceful demonstrators and others who used the chaos to begin looting.\n\nWilson, the officer who fired the fatal shots, said he shot Michael in self defence and was never indicted on charges of criminal wrongdoing. Though many question the circumstances surrounding Michael's death, there's no denying his death had a powerful impact.\n\nA decade on from that fateful night, Metro spoke to some of the protesters who were on the ground soon after the shooting, about how Ferguson has changed since Michael's death.\n\n'I just saw this dude get killed.'\n\nThese are the words that met Johnetta (Netta) Elzie when she logged onto her Twitter account on August 9 - paired with a photo of Michael lying lifeless in the street.\n\n'I was like, \"What the f*** is happening?\"' she tells Metro. 'If you don't know Missouri, it's hot as hell. It was summertime and really humid. People were saying Mike's body was laying in the street - in that heat - for hours. That alarmed me. It made me aware of the cruelty of the moment we were in.'\n\nNetta and her friend drove to Ferguson after work that evening. She recalls that, initially, not much was going on near the crime scene. However, she did overhear small children who lived nearby Canfield Street say to their parents, 'Mike Mike got killed.'\n\n'Hearing that come out of the kids' mouth and seeing Mike's blood still on that street even after people had tried to wash away his blood earlier that day...' she remembers. 'Those two moments are what made me keep showing up. From the mouth of babes, right?'\n\nNetta protested in Ferguson for the first few days after Michael's death, but she says the situation was made more personal after police militarised to address reported looting - on the same night as a candlelight vigil.\n\n'They had on full armour and M16s in their hands, while we had candles,' she explains. On day five of the protests, she was tear gassed for the first time.\n\n'That's when I was like, \"Oh, y'all f***** up. Now this is personal.\" They were messing with my health - I'm asthmatic,' says Netta. 'I got tear gassed and shot on the same night - with rubber bullets my tax dollars paid for.'\n\nAfter that night, there was no turning back for her. Netta took part in the Ferguson protests - which would go on to last hundreds of days - and documented each night on her phone, earning her the title online of 'social media activist', which led her to her current job of policy work and consultancy.\n\nThe scenes that Netta still can't shake 10 years on are those of children being in the line of rubber bullets amidst the chaos. Having welcomed her own son three years ago, she now has a different perspective on her time in Ferguson.\n\n'For the first eight years or so of doing this work, I was childless. Now, I have a husband and son - both of whom are Black,' she reflects.\n\n'It's a glaring reality that all of the work that I have been doing - while it does impact me - has impacted people I hadn't even thought of yet.'\n\nLike many other Americans, DeRay McKesson first watched the events in Ferguson unfold on his phone, nearly 600 miles away in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nWhen he witnessed protestors clash with the police, the former teacher packed his car and posted online: 'En route to Ferguson.'\n\nHe tells Metro: 'I remember thinking, \"We gotta figure out what's happening. I want do something and I don't know what to do.\" I had never been an activist in that way before.\n\n'But if I couldn't give up my weekend for this, then did I really care?'\n\nThe first night DeRay was tear gassed, he says it changed his life. The police had said there was a curfew at midnight - but he claims the tear gassing began around 8pm.\n\n'We were right and the police thought they were going to scare us, going to bully us into being quiet. That didn't happen,' he explains.\n\n'I think the police thought was that if they came out in force that people would be afraid and go home.\n\n'They didn't realise that coming out in force just made more people come out because people knew the killing of Mike Brown was unjust and wrong.'\n\nAfter giving up his job and protesting in Ferguson for hundreds of days, DeRay became one of the most familiar faces on television screens. He also co-founded the project Campaign Zero, which aims to be a policy answer for the change protesters wanted to see.\n\n'We can influence police violence in this lifetime,' he explains. 'Before August 2014, I would have said the police are breaking the rules. When we started this work, I realised - \"Oh. The police are playing by a different set of rules.\"\n\n'We can expose this and we can make change.'\n\nDeRay tells Metro that Michael's mother, Leslie McSpadden, doesn't commemorate August 9, when her son was gunned down in the heat of summer.\n\nShe does, however, celebrate his birthday each year in May. But that doesn't make it easier.\n\n'Everyday, she says it feels like it happened yesterday,' says DeRay.\n\nReminders of the events of August 2014 are all around in Ferguson - the site where the QuikTrip burned down is now the Ferguson Community Empowerment Centre, run by the Salvation Army and the Urban League of St. Louis.\n\nMichael McMillan, 53, the president and CEO of the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis, tells Metro that Michael's death was a breaking point for the community.\n\n'There was a lot of rage, anger, resentment and disgust from people in the community that felt as though there was a very bad history from the police and the community,' he explains.\n\n'At the time of Michael Brown's death, there had never been a Black manager of the city government. There was only one city council man who was Black.'\n\nSince then, the city has elected their first Black female mayor, more African Americans to the city council and a Black police chief.\n\nMcMillan, a native St. Louisan, believes Michael's death changed the city forever.\n\n'I think it was the worst moment in my lifetime, where we were shown all of the inadequacies and the problems of our public policies and our lack of investment in areas that needed it,' he says.\n\n'It inspired us to want to do more and be better versions of ourselves and not just rest on the morals of our past for those of us who have been involved in community, civic, charitable and government service.'\n\nFerguson Police came under intense scrutiny in the years after Michael's death, but a spokesperson tells Metro the biggest changes in their department since 2014 are in the forms of training, community engagement and diversity.\n\n'We are still the police and will still enforce the law but we do so in a manner that has a greater focus on protecting and preserving people's constitutional rights,' they explain. 'We are focused on becoming the best-trained force in the region and a model for community policing.\n\n'Ferguson is a resilient city. The challenges that were brought to light after the death of Michael Brown were not new challenges and there were ongoing attempts to address them.\n\n'But after his death people came to grips with the enormity of the problem. Our community decided to face the challenges head on and rise. We have much more work to do but we are more resolute.'\n\nTen years have passed, but the work started by those who were on the ground in the days following Michael's death continues as injustices are still happening.\n\nMost recently, unarmed 36-year-old Sonya Massey was shot and killed by police after she called to report a 'prowler' near her home.\n\nReferencing the seismic changes in St Louis and the US after Michael's death, Netta observes: 'I think our work continues as far as policing goes - no matter who is in office.\n\n'It's more about the community being focused on each other versus what could even go on in the White House.'\n\nMORE : Donald Trump agrees to debate Kamala Harris - and challenges her to two more", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

Long enough for the media to gather and the news to spread.\n\nAnd long enough for a spark of rage over yet another unarmed Black man being killed by police to ignite and spread throughout the city of Ferguson.\n\nMike Brown's killing - and the hundreds of days of sustained protest that followed - helped strengthen the Black Lives Matter movement and brought the issue of police use of force against unarmed Black Americans to the forefront of US policy and politics like never before. But a decade later, the nation's progress toward preventing such a killing has remained frustratingly slow.\n\nAnd for Brown's family, the ensuing years have done little to transmute the pain of losing the brother and son they affectionally called \"Mike Mike.\"\n\nOn Friday, Michael Brown Sr., and his wife, Cal Brown, will walk the four and half miles from the high school where their son graduated just days before he was killed through the streets of Ferguson to the place they call \"ground zero\" - the rugged patch of asphalt where the teenager laid that remains untouched despite the years.\n\n\"I am still struggling,\" Mike Brown Sr., said during an appearance on a St. Louis faith leader and talk show host's social media channel earlier this week. \"I definitely get a lot of my justice through my work with my foundation, so that's what keeps me uplifted.\"\n\nCNN has reached out to the Brown family for comment.\n\nThe march is meant to be a call to action to continue the fight against police excessive use of force and is part of the family's weeklong tribute to the young man Mike Brown was and could have been.\n\n\"People overlook a grieving family,\" Cal Brown said the appearance, \"because death has become so normalized ... Ten years ago, Mike Brown Jr., was not the first, nor was he the last.\"\n\nBefore Michael Brown, there was Eric Garner. And before Eric there was Trayvon Martin. Each name is added to an inauspicious roll call of the Black men and women killed at the hands of police that stretches back generations.\n\nSonya Massey's name was added to that list in July. She's among the more than 1,100 people who have been shot and killed by police in the last 12 months alone, according to a database of fatal police encounters created and maintained by the Washington Post.\n\nThe Post's data relies on media reports, some law enforcement records and social media to aggregate the death toll because there's no federal law requiring police departments report the number of encounters that end in fatalities to the government.\n\nAs a result, according to the Post, the death toll is widely thought to be undercounted.\n\n\"We're in a moment where we're seeing history repeat itself, or at least a rhyme, and rhyme and rhyme, and rhyme,\" said Phillip Solomon, a professor of African American studies and psychology at Yale.\n\nSolomon said he was inspired to study the issue of racism in policing in part because of the 1999 killing of Amadou Diallo. The 23-year-old West African immigrant was shot 41 times by plainclothes New York City police officers while standing in the entryway to his apartment.\n\nDiallo was unarmed. The officers who killed him were later acquitted.\n\n\"For a generation of folks, they grew up post-Trayvon, post-Mike Brown and Ferguson, and they saw what wasn't working and they got frustrated and impatient,\" Solomon said.\n\nCalls to abolish or defund the police surged after the 2020 death of George Floyd, but they have since lost traction and Solomon said that same impatient generation has begun to ask, \"What now?\"\n\n\"That question to me is one of the most energizing, optimistic things that's happening because there is moral certainty that if we want to call police 'public safety,' we're doing public safety all the way wrong,\" he said.\n\nSolomon co-founded the Center for Policing Equity, which uses data and science to try find a way to make policing in America \"less racist and less deadly,\" according to the organization's website.\n\nBut the weight of each person killed by police lands like a boulder, Solomon said. And making progress, he said, is like trying to tip the scale using only feathers - especially as the political will to pass legislation like the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act has dwindled over the years.\n\n\"As a nation, we're not built for a long-term project of undoing the racism, not just in policing but in all the systems that end up in policing,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't see a point in my lifetime where there won't be boulders,\" he added. \"I think what we can do is we can pay real close attention to the feathers.\"\n\nThe Ferguson Police Department no longer looks as it did in 2014.\n\nBack then, the department had around 60 officers and fewer than five were African American, Ferguson Police Chief Troy Doyle told CNN.\n\n\"Now, as we sit here in August of 2024, we have right at about 50% African American representation and along with that we have about a 23% female representation,\" he said.\n\nDoyle said Brown's killing and the ensuing protests have left a lasting impact on the department and their approach to policing.\n\nThe department remains under a 2016 federal consent decree that was put in place after the Department of Justice issued a scathing report that found the city's officers and court system had engaged in a \"pattern and practice\" of discrimination against African Americans, targeting them disproportionately for traffic stops, use of force and jail sentences.\n\nUnder the decree, Ferguson officers have undergone trainings on implicit bias, crisis intervention and the use of force, Doyle said. Out of the more than 30,000 calls the department received in 2023, the police chief said fewer than 1% resulted in a use of force.\n\n\"Which tells me that the provisions in the consent decree, along with the training that my officers are receiving, that (the officers are) buying into this new form of policing, and it's working,\" Doyle said.\n\nThe consent decree also requires an independent monitoring team to issue reports on the department's progress toward reform. According to the monitor's most recent report, \"the city's progress toward compliance with the Consent Decree largely stalled during 2022 and into 2023,\" due in part to turn over in the city's police and fire department, but the department remains committed to complying.\n\nDoyle said ultimately, his goal as chief is to engage with Ferguson's community so his department is seen as a \"legitimate, effective, professional law enforcement agency.\"\n\n\"With that in mind, we also got to remember that police officers are hired from the human race,\" Doyle said. \"That means there are going to be occasions where mistakes are made and unfortunately, our goal and our job is to minimize those mistakes.\"\n\nDarren Wilson, the officer who shot and killed Mike Brown, never faced criminal charges for killing the teenager.\n\nSolomon said he believes one the reasons the country has yet meaningfully address the issue of police killings is because \"we literally have not responded in the basic human way to the simple articulation: Please allow Black lives to matter.\"\n\nHe said there are specific policies that could have been put in place to prevent the deaths of Brown or someone like Massey, but there's a lack of political will.\n\n\"It's the humblest battle cry and motto you could possibly imagine, 'Hey, I'd like it if you treated me like my life mattered.' But there is an entire political machine right now dedicated to ... turning their activism into the most radical, seedy, violent criminal behavior,\" Solomon said.\n\nShortly after his son's death, Michael Brown Sr., started an eponymous organization called \"Chosen for Change,\" where he and his family have spent the last decade reaching out to fathers and families who have experienced traumatic loss.\n\nBrown Sr., acknowledged the Ferguson police department has made progress over the years, but he compared the changes to a \"rebrand.\"\n\n\"They've tried to do different things, bodycams, don't stop and frisk no more,\" he said during the social media interview earlier this week. \"It's just a lot of cancer in this system that they can't just change faces right now, they have to change the whole system.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Many of them said Brown was retreating and had his hands in the air. Wilson was relieved from duty but St. Louis County prosecutor Wesley Bell declined to charge him with a crime. So did the U.S. Department of Justice, which months later did issue a consent decree outlining the racist policing tactics used against Black residents in the city.\n\nThe shooting and its aftermath took a toll on a crestfallen family and a city mired in underdevelopment. With the national spotlight on Ferguson, residents renewed their calls for improvements, but none of those cries have wrought substantial change in the 10 years since, they say.\n\nFew people understand this urgency, and frustration, more than Michael Brown Sr.\n\nThe death of his son forced Brown, 45, to change, to \"grow up,\" he said. Once a reserved man, he has blossomed into a nonprofit leader and community activist, all the while grieving so intensely that he only began laughing again last year, he said.\n\nAlmost everywhere in Ferguson are reminders of his 18-year-old child -- on billboards, in businesses, on T-shirts. There is a feeling of communal connection to the family, an empathy that runs deep and an undying sense of grief because Brown was one of them. The ubiquitous image of Michael is also a reminder of the city's unheard cries for investment and reform.\n\n\"There has been a lot of money that's come here through the death of Mike Brown,\" his father said. \"There's a lot of stuff that has been built and put in place -- but not in the right places. There's still a lot of work that needs to be done.\"\n\nSome parts of town have been upgraded with streetscaping; a National Urban League community center now stands where there was a QT convenience store that was burned down during the protests.\n\nBut most of those who spoke to NBC News said progress in Ferguson has been frustratingly slow. Decades of government records show Coldwater Creek, which runs nearby, has long been dangerously contaminated. Additionally, residents say more businesses have shuttered than opened along W. Florissant, the avenue at the heart of the unrest. The main thoroughfare looks almost identical to 2014, save for a Boys & Girls Club and a health clinic. New affordable housing has been minimal.\n\nThe median family income here was $42,000 in 2014, about $9,000 less than the national average; it was $47,410 in 2022, far below the $74,580 national average, according to the most recent census.\n\nJustin Idleburg, a childhood friend of the elder Brown and member of Forward Through Ferguson, a group created to help local organizations, businesses and communities promote racial equity, said any influx of resources have had little impact on residents' lives.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/10-years-after-Michael-Browns-death-Ferguson-struggles-with-change.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803411", "eventUri": "eng-9803411", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

To that end, two days ago, on Aug. 7th in St. Louis, he and scholar and professor, Dr. Travis Harris, met with Brown Sr.\n\nDr. Travis was living in Virginia and just beginning his graduate work at the College of William and Mary when the horror of August 9th - and the power of the uprising - unfolded. He traveled to Ferguson for the first time in October 2014 to lend his body, breath and brilliance to the national call to action by Tory in the fall of that year. He went back to finish his PhD, but his heart never really left Ferguson and over the years, he built deep relationships, including with Tory and Mike Brown Sr.\n\n\"He's a soft-spoken, quiet man,\" Tory told me about Brown Sr.\n\nWatching him unfold himself in the safety of brotherhood was an amazing sight - even knowing the closeness that had developed between him and Dr. Travis, who I wanted to ask what the moment was during the interview - that took his breath away.\n\nDr. Travis said in a voice that was equal parts calm and brimming with emotion, \"I asked him if he thought that it could be his son laying there in that street?\"\n\nMr. Brown paused, but only slightly and then answered, \"I always thought it would be me.\"\n\nAfter that, Tory, Dr. Travis and I - who were on a morning call together - went silent. We needed to hold the solemnity of that statement.\n\nAnd then finally, \"Me too,\" said Tory. \"That's why I do this work. I always thought it would be me laying there. But when they killed one of our children,\" the father of two continued. \"I knew exactly what I needed to commit my life to.\"\n\nWith love, grace, hope and gratitude, here is Ferguson X: NewsOne's conversation with Mike Brown Sr.\n\nFerguson X: Mike Brown Should Be Here, Be 28, And Be Living His Best Life\n\nGeorge Floyd Justice In Policing Act Reintroduced 4 Years After Notorious Police Murder In Minneapolis\n\nPublic Reaction To Mike Brown Verdict In Ferguson 0 photos", "source": {"uri": "newsone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News One"}, "authors": [{"uri": "asha_bandele@newsone.com", "name": "Asha Bandele", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_E._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael E.

Brown's death helped fuel the national debate about policing and race.\n\nMissouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson was in charge of leading law enforcement efforts to stop violence and keep the peace in Ferguson after the deadly Aug. 9, 2014, shooting.\n\n\"I think that the partnership between law enforcement and the leadership of this community continue to come together to not allow the agitators and that criminal element to define the protests,\" Johnson told CBS News' Vladimir Duthiers in 2014 after days of demonstrations.\n\nIn a new CBS special, \"13 DAYS IN FERGUSON,\" the now-retired police captain reunites with his longtime friend Cedric the Entertainer, who grew up near Ferguson, to memorialize Brown and reflect on the aftermath of the police shooting. Watch the special on Friday, Aug. 9 at 10 p.m. ET on CBS or stream it on Paramount+.\n\n\"Some of our lives have purpose as we walk this Earth, and some of our lives have purpose when we're not here,\" said Johnson as he and Cedric the Entertainer read a plaque in Brown's honor. The moving moment was featured in the CBS documentary.\n\nJohnson told \"CBS Mornings\" on Friday that visiting Brown's memorial and other notable scenes made him relive those days in Ferguson.\n\n\"Going back was reliving it all over. It was like it hadn't been 10 years. It was kind of like getting up that first morning and going out to the scene in Ferguson. So it's changed my life. It's changed me as a person, and it's made me better,\" Johnson said.\n\nA decade later, Johnson believes Brown's death continues to be a catalyst for change but said there still needs to be more progress on improving police and community relations.\n\n\"I think we've made some steps and we've gotten better, but we still have a ways to go. We still see things in our country that exist today and still happen today, so we've got a ways to go but we've gotten better,\" Johnson added.\n\nIn the documentary, Johnson sits down with Michael Brown, Sr. for the first time. Reflecting on his time as Ferguson's security chief, Johnson said his first initiative as a leader should have been offering his condolences to Brown's parents.\n\n\"It is one of my biggest regrets,\" said Johnson, adding that he has had to learn to forgive himself for not speaking to Brown's parents earlier.\n\nJohnson, who had close ties to the Ferguson community, knew that he would be responsible for helping ensure the protests remained peaceful following the fatal 2014 shooting. But he wasn't expecting to be the face of Ferguson's law enforcement at the time.\n\n\"Never did a dream that I would be put in charge of Ferguson that day,\" Johnson told \"CBS Mornings\" co-anchor Gayle King, adding that he never questioned \"Why me?\"\n\nIt was a bumpy road for Johnson, who represented the police but also wanted to march alongside protesters at the same time.\n\n\"Then you start asking yourself, 'What is your place? Who are you? Has this uniform made you who you thought you were -- or was it the color of your skin?\" Johnson explained.\n\nHe was seen marching with protesters, listening to their concerns and even hugging some of them while leading law enforcement efforts.

Though it's now been 10 years, I still recall that day vividly -- and I was merely an observer from somewhat nearby.\n\nOn August 9, 2014, 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. The effects of that shooting and its aftermath are still being felt today, five years later. I had been hosting the \"Q With A View\" podcast on FTRRadio since January of that year and, given the proximity of the shooting and the shockwaves it sent through my community, covered the story at length. Eventually, that coverage evolved into a radio documentary/special we aired in December 2014. Following is a (minimally updated) piece I wrote at the time and the accompanying link to the special, which was a labor of love -- one that had a profound effect on me. I hope you'll give it a listen:\n\n\"Where were you when....?\" The special we first aired on FTRRadio in December 2014 starts out with that question. Four-and-a-half months prior, when news of the Michael Brown shooting broke, I was returning from a typical Saturday afternoon at the soccer park, with zero realization that this would become one of those moments. It's always disturbing to hear of a young person's death, but sadly, not so uncommon as to seem like one of those time-standing-still moments that become fixed in one's memory like a historical north star. Even the fact that Brown's death came at the hands of police didn't immediately signal to me that we'd still be talking about it as 2014 drew to a close -- much less, five years later. Nor did I foresee then that the north county neighborhood I'd always thought of as simply an older, blue-collar, racially diverse suburb would soon become a sociological Rorschach with a different meaning to each, and a hashtag with a life of its own.\n\nWhen a vigil the following day gave way to a protest, and later to looting and rioting, I watched and shook my head in disbelief at the destructive forces I was witnessing. I recognized the tire store whose windows were smashed out; the parking lots from which several local newscasters were reporting. Ferguson isn't my hometown, but it's an integral part of the St. Louis fabric, and near enough to home that seeing violence and chaos erupt on its streets rattled me in a way most news stories don't -- not in fear for my own safety, but in sadness for my community.\n\nAs the days wore on and competing narratives unfurled, it was tempting to choose a \"side.\" Sometimes, as new evidence came to light, and emotionally persuasive arguments were hashed out, it was hard not to, but I kept reminding myself -- I wasn't there, and I don't know exactly what happened. Just as people who've never been to St. Louis or Ferguson don't know our community. Early on, I bristled when I saw Ferguson referred to as \"Selma.\" But then, I also had to acknowledge that there were problems and tensions present from which I'd previously remained somewhat shielded. I started looking a little closer, listening a little longer.\n\nWhen I heard a rapper named Daywalker call into the Allman in the Morning (radio) Show and relate to the host, Jamie Allman, not only his experience as a protestor, but also his hope and vision that somehow Ferguson could become an opportunity for rebuilding, rather than just a tragedy, I was intrigued. On a whim, I contacted Jamie and asked if he'd be willing to put me in touch with Daywalker -- I thought it might be interesting to have him on my show as a guest. Jamie very graciously did so, and soon, what began as a one-time interview turned into a regular segment on my show, featuring Daywalker as our \"Northside Correspondent.\"\n\nI quickly learned that Daywalker was bursting not only with energy but also with ideas. When he suggested that we sit down with his Rabbi, Susan Talve, to interview her regarding her role as a clergy member who'd been part of the protests, I was unsure. I knew it would be interesting to speak with her, but I was uncertain as to how we might incorporate that into the show -- doubly so when what I'd expected to be a 15 or 20-minute interview turned into 45 minutes. The thought occurred to me that we might want to go a slightly different direction.\n\nWhen Daywalker followed that up with the suggestion we speak with St. Louis County Police Department Spokesman Sergeant Brian Schellman, the idea for a stand-alone special on Ferguson began to take shape. Ultimately, we spoke with Sgt. Schellman and another officer from one of the North County municipal police departments. We also met with Jamie Allman to get his take on the media coverage regarding Ferguson. Then, too, I took the opportunity to interview Daywalker himself -- after all, he lived in the community, and it was his passion that set us on this journey. I'm not sure what exactly I was expecting, but I was pleasantly surprised by the willingness of all of our guests to speak with us, and so openly. I felt like we ended up with some very frank and fascinating discussions, rather than canned, cautious responses.\n\nIt's a Beautiful Day in the Missouri Congressional District One Neighborhood!\n\nWhat's Missing From Downtown St. Louis? A Street Honoring Michael Brown, but That May Soon Change\n\nWhat my co-host, Jason Dibler, then did to piece them all together and incorporate some of Daywalker's music is nothing short of amazing, in my view. In the end, I believe we've managed to put together a very honest and compelling look at Ferguson, and what it's meant to protestors, police, members of the media, and the community.\n\nFor my own part, it's taught me that each one of us has a story and that if you give them a chance, most people will share theirs with you. Sometimes, all it takes is asking a question or two. Sometimes, all it takes is really looking another in the eye and acknowledging them as an individual, as someone who matters.\n\nSince we completed our interviews, the story of Ferguson -- and the larger stories of police and the communities they serve and of race relations as a whole -- have continued to unfold. From the non-indictment in the Eric Garner case to demonstrations turned into riots, to the assassination of Officers Ramos and Liu, it seems like Ferguson has become the pulled thread in an ever-unraveling societal fabric. Which is why the question, \"Where do we go from here?\" seems such a fitting way to close out the special.\n\nWhere do we go, indeed? I can't say that I know for certain, but I feel like I have an idea: It starts, I believe, with remembering our humanity.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "susie_moore@redstate.com", "name": "Susie Moore", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Michael_Brown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Killing of Michael Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daywalker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daywalker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Brown_(basketball,_born_1970)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Brown (basketball, born 1970)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach,_Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rorschach, Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rorschach, Switzerland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-collar_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blue-collar worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_lot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parking lot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hashtag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sociology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selma,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Selma, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Selma, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Eric_Garner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Killing of Eric Garner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Race relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_a_Beautiful_Day", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "It's a Beautiful Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Downtown St. Louis"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2017/126/1cc27f06-9821-43a9-b7da-bdfb6a3b1ef7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803411", "eventUri": "eng-9803411", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-08-09", "textStart": 229, "textEnd": 243}, {"amb": false, "date": "2014-12-", "textStart": 710, "textEnd": 723, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Since then, DeRay has gone on to become a best-selling author and political force for racial justice among many of his other successes. While we've disagreed on some things over the years -- primarily what constitutes a justifiable use of fatal force by law enforcement -- but one thing that we do agree on is that the issue of police violence remains a concerning one for Black Americans. One needs to look no further than the recent murder of Sonya Massey to confirm that. Ten years after \"Hands up, don't shoot\" became the rallying cry of Ferguson, Massey had her own hands up when she was shot in the face by a sheriff's deputy in Illinois who has now been indicted for murder. Instead of saying \"don't shoot,\" Massey said, \"I'm sorry.\"\n\n***\n\nIt was a rumor. Let's start with that. I don't think it was done nefariously. I think the people who said it that day and in the days that followed truly believed it. It's what they had been told, after all. Somewhere along the line -- somewhere in this game of telephone that people like me try to get to the bottom of -- maybe there was a lie. Maybe someone lied. Or, they just got things mixed up in the heat of the moment. They got it mixed up because someone they knew had died and his body was baking on the asphalt in the middle of the street with blood leaking from a bullet wound in his head.\n\nThe rumor was that Michael Brown had his hands up on this very day, 10 years ago today, in Ferguson, Missouri. He had his hands up and he said, \"Don't shoot,\" the people said. That's what started it all. Mike Brown, a kid no one had ever heard of, had his hands up and was saying \"Don't shoot\" when a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri shot and killed him on August 9, 2014. That's where it begins. Or at least, that's where it begins in a sense. Ferguson was a domino. There have been many more over the years.\n\n\"Hands up don't shoot\" is the beginning of a lot of things. As I sit here this morning, though, the thing that strikes me the most is that the falsehood of \"Hands up, don't shoot\" is the beginning of our current political moment. No matter the event, no matter the truth of what happened on any given day, each side can claim their own version. Ferguson and Black Americans were rightfully incensed over the claim that Brown had had his hands up and was saying \"don't shoot.\" But when it turned out not be true, much of white America -- themselves already incensed and afraid after watching Ferguson burn -- dismissed the entire movement for racial justice that Ferguson birthed.\n\nWhite America took that mentality -- these people lied about what happened, denigrated a good cop, and then burned their own town and they'll do it to our's next -- and ran with it. They ran with it right into the waiting arms of Donald Trump, the \"law and order\" candidate. Then they kept running with it.\n\nThe truth can be complicated. The first thing you often hear about a news event like Ferguson is a chaotic and murky version of the actual truth. But white America would not forgive this falsehood of Ferguson. Already driven by racial anger at what it saw, white America took the idea that they were being lied to by people who were, in their view, anti-American, and began to apply to everything that has happened since. The impeachments of Donald Trump -- fake, based on lies. The 2020 election. Lies, again. Stolen from them. George Floyd -- he died because of a fentanyl overdose, not the knee on his neck.\n\nIn a way, it's a shame that \"Hand up, don't shoot\" turned out not to be true. If it had been, we might not be exactly where we are today. But something tells me that white America would have found another reason to drag us to our current state. There's always a reason, it seems, for many Americans to want to usher us toward authoritarianism and backwards toward a past rooted in white supremacy.\n\nI say this not because this is what I learned at some leftist Ivy League university. The education I've received that has led me to this conclusion has come from witnessing the events of the last 10 years with my own eyes. I've learned how and why we've ended up here by being on the streets of places like Ferguson and witnessing the aftermath firsthand. My education has been history itself.\n\n***", "source": {"uri": "american-doom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "american-doom.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justin_glawe@american-doom.com", "name": "Justin Glawe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hands_up,_don't_shoot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hands up, don't shoot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeRay_Mckesson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DeRay Mckesson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police brutality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ferguson, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ferguson, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_and_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law and order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Americanism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Americanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fentanyl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug overdose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drag queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:best,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fjustinglawe.substack.com%2Fapi%2Fv1%2Fpost_preview%2F147521046%2Ftwitter.jpg%3Fversion%3D4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803411", "eventUri": "eng-9803411", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-08-09", "textStart": 1908, "textEnd": 1922}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

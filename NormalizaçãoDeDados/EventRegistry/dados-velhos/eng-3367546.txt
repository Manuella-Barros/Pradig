Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nStory highlightsIn his writings, Lee feared statues honoring Civil War generals might \"keep open the sores of war\"But that didn't stop civic and heritage groups from erecting monuments to Lee after his death\n\n(CNN)There's been much controversy in Charlottesville and beyond about preserving monuments to Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. But if you had a chance to ask the guy, he'd most likely say, no thanks.\n\nBased on his writings, Lee was not a fan of statues honoring Civil War generals, fearing they might \"keep open the sores of war.\"According to historian Jonathan Horn, Lee was often consulted in his lifetime about proposals to erect monuments to Confederate Gen. Stonewall Jackson and others. In a 1866 letter to fellow Confederate Gen. Thomas L. Rosser, Lee wrote, \"As regards the erection of such a monument as is contemplated, my conviction is, that however grateful it would be to the feelings of the South, the attempt ... would have the effect of ... continuing, if not adding to, the difficulties under which the Southern people labour.\"Three years later, Lee was invited to a meeting of Union and Confederate officers to mark the placing of a memorial honoring those who took part in the battle of Gettysburg. Read More\"I think it wiser not to keep open the sores of war but to follow the examples of those nations who endeavored to obliterate the marks of civil strife, to commit to oblivion the feelings engendered,\" he wrote in a letter declining the invitation.But that didn't stop civic and heritage groups from erecting numerous monuments to Lee, commander of the Confederate armies during the Civil War, after his death in 1870. Now, however, most of those memorials are under fire by those who see them as symbols of America's dark legacy of slavery.Lee himself was a complex and polarizing figure. In an 1856 letter to his wife, he called slavery \"a moral & political evil.\" But Lee also was a slaveholder, and in the same letter he wrote, \"The painful discipline they (blacks) are undergoing is necessary for their instruction as a race.\"In May, amid controversy, a statue of Lee was removed from its pedestal in a New Orleans square. And officials in Charlottesville, Virginia, voted earlier this year to remove a bronze statue of Lee from a city park, prompting protests by white nationalist groups that turned deadly last weekend.A similar debate is underway in Richmond, Virginia, where monuments to Lee and other Civil War figures tower over a prominent avenue.Such conflict over Civil War symbols, some 150 years after the war ended, makes Lee look prescient.\"Lee feared that these reminders of the past would preserve fierce passions for the future,\" wrote Horn, author of a Lee biography titled \"The Man Who Would Not Be Washington\" and a former White House presidential speechwriter. \"Such emotions threatened his vision for speedy reconciliation,\" Horn added last year in an opinion piece for CNN. \"As he saw it, bridging a divided country justified abridging history in places.\"Lee's great-great grandson might agree. \"We have to be able to have that conversation (about symbols of the Confederacy) without all of the hatred and the violence,\" Robert E. Lee V told CNN this week. \"And if they choose to take those statues down, fine. Maybe it's appropriate to have them in museums or to put them in some sort of historical context in that regard.\"\n\nCNN's Polo Sandoval and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.", "id": "9583279", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Actually, Robert E.

Lee was opposed to Confederate monuments.\n\n\"It's often forgotten that Lee himself, after the Civil War, opposed monuments, specifically Confederate war monuments,\" Jonathan Horn, a Lee biographer, told PBS.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Lee received a number of letters requesting support for the erection of Confederate memorials, according to Horn.\n\nIn June 1866, he wrote that he couldn't support a monument of one of his best generals, Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson, saying it wasn't \"feasible at this time.\"\n\nSEE ALSO: Trump slams removing 'beauty' of Confederate monuments as 'foolish'\n\n\"As regards the erection of such a monument as is contemplated,\" Lee wrote in December 1866 about another proposed Confederate monument, \"my conviction is, that however grateful it would be to the feelings of the South, the attempt in the present condition of the Country, would have the effect of retarding, instead of accelerating its accomplishment; [and] of continuing, if not adding to, the difficulties under which the Southern people labour.\"\n\nNot only was Lee opposed to Confederate memorials, \"he favored erasing battlefields from the landscape altogether,\" Horn wrote.\n\nHe even supported getting rid of the Confederate flag after the Civil War ended, and didn't want them them flying above Washington College, which he was president of after the war.\n\n\"Lee did not want such divisive symbols following him to the grave,\" Horn wrote. \"At his funeral in 1870, flags were notably absent from the procession. Former Confederate soldiers marching did not don their old military uniforms, and neither did the body they buried.\"\n\n\"His Confederate uniform would have been 'treason' perhaps!\" Lee's daughter wrote, according to Horn.\n\n\"Lee believed countries that erased visible signs of civil war recovered from conflicts quicker,\" Horn told PBS. \"He was worried that by keeping these symbols alive, it would keep the divisions alive.\"\n\nSEE ALSO: GETTYSBURG: Here's how the Civil War's most important battle was fought\n\nMore from AOL.com:\n\nUndeterred, US cities ramp up removal of Confederate statues\n\nThere are still 100s of Confederacy symbols across the US -- here's where they are\n\nVirginia receives new request for rally at Robert E.

Lee -- and what a leader! ... No military leader since Napoleon has aroused such enthusiastic devotion among troops as did Lee when he reviewed them on his horse Traveller.\"\n\nSo wrote Samuel Eliot Morison in his magisterial \"The Oxford History of the American People\" in 1965.\n\nFirst in his class at West Point, hero of the Mexican War, Lee was the man to whom President Lincoln turned to lead his army. But when Virginia seceded, Lee would not lift up his sword against his own people, and chose to defend his home state rather than wage war upon her.\n\nThis veneration of Lee, wrote Richard Weaver, \"appears in the saying attributed to a Confederate soldier, 'The rest of us may have ... descended from monkeys, but it took a God to make Marse Robert.'\"\n\nGrowing up after World War II, this was accepted history.\n\nYet, on the militant left today, the name Lee evokes raw hatred and howls of \"racist and traitor.\" A clamor has arisen to have all statues of him and all Confederate soldiers and statesmen pulled down from their pedestals and put in museums or tossed onto trash piles.\n\nWhat has changed since 1965?\n\nIt is not history. There have been no great new discoveries about Lee.\n\nWhat has changed is America herself. She is not the same country. We have passed through a great social, cultural and moral revolution that has left us irretrievably divided on separate shores.\n\nTwo years ago, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe called the giant statues of Lee and \"Stonewall\" Jackson on Richmond's Monument Avenue \"parts of our heritage.\" After Charlottesville, New York-born-and-bred McAuliffe, entertaining higher ambitions, went full scalawag, demanding the statues be pulled down as \"flashpoints for hatred, division, and violence.\"\n\nWho hates the statues, Terry? Who's going to cause the violence? Answer: The Democratic left whom Terry must now appease.\n\nMcAuliffe is echoed by Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, the Democratic candidate in November to succeed McAuliffe. GOP nominee Ed Gillespie wants Monument Avenue left alone.\n\nThe election is the place to decide this, but the left will not wait.\n\nIn Durham, North Carolina, our Taliban smashed the statue of a Confederate soldier. Near the entrance of Duke University Chapel, a statue of Lee has been defaced, the nose broken off.\n\nWednesday at dawn, Baltimore carried out a cultural cleansing by taking down statues of Lee and Maryland Chief Justice Roger Taney who wrote the Dred Scott decision and opposed Lincoln's suspension of the right of habeas corpus.\n\nLike ISIS, which smashed the storied ruins of Palmyra, and the al-Qaida rebels who ravaged the fabled Saharan city of Timbuktu, the new barbarism has come to America. This is going to become a blazing issue, not only between but within the parties.\n\nFor there are 10 Confederates in Statuary Hall in the Capitol, among them Lee, Georgia's Alexander Stephens, vice president to Jefferson Davis, and Davis himself. The Black Caucus wants them gone.\n\nMount Rushmore-sized carvings of Lee, Jackson and Davis are on Stone Mountain, Georgia. Are they to be blasted off?\n\nThere are countless universities, colleges and high schools like Washington & Lee named for Confederate statesmen and soldiers. Across the Potomac from D.C. are Jefferson Davis Highway and Leesburg Pike to Leesburg itself, 25 miles north. Are all highways, streets, towns and counties named for Confederates to be renamed? What about Fort Bragg?\n\nOn every Civil War battlefield, there are monuments to the Southern fallen. Gettysburg has hundreds of memorials, statues and markers. But if, as the left insists we accept, the Confederates were traitors trying to tear America apart to preserve an evil system, upon what ground do Democrats stand to resist the radical left's demands?\n\nWhat do we do with those battlefields where Confederates were victorious: Bull Run, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville?\n\n\"Where does this all end?\" President Trump asked.\n\nIt doesn't. Not until America's histories and biographies are burned and new texts written to Nazify Lee, Jackson, Davis and all the rest, will a newly indoctrinated generation of Americans accede to this demand to tear down and destroy what their fathers cherished.\n\nAnd once all the Confederates are gone, one must begin with the explorers, and then the slave owners like Presidents Washington, Jefferson and Madison, who seceded from slave-free Britain. White supremacists all.\n\nAndrew Jackson, Henry Clay of Kentucky and John Calhoun must swiftly follow.\n\nThen there are all those segregationists. From 1865 to 1965, virtually all of the great Southern senators were white supremacists.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, Woodrow Wilson and FDR carried all 11 states of a rigidly segregationist South all six times they ran, and FDR rewarded Dixie by putting a Klansman on the Supreme Court.\n\nWhile easy for Republicans to wash their hands of such odious elements as Nazis in Charlottesville, will they take up the defense of the monuments and statues that have defined our history, or capitulate to the icon-smashers?\n\nIn this Second American Civil War, whose side are you

President Donald Trump waded in to ask: \"This week, it is Robert E. Lee and this week, Stonewall Jackson. Is it George Washington next? You have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\"\n\nBut now historians are claiming that Lee himself, known for commanding the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia in the Civil War, specifically opposed such statues.\n\nJonathan Horn, a Lee biographer, told PBS: \"It's often forgotten that Lee himself, after the Civil War, opposed monuments, specifically Confederate war monuments.\"\n\nIn a 1866 letter to fellow Confederate Gen.

Lee -- and what a leader! ... No military leader since Napoleon has aroused such enthusiastic devotion among troops as did Lee when he reviewed them on his horse Traveller.\"\n\nSo wrote Samuel Eliot Morison in his magisterial \"The Oxford History of the American People\" in 1965.\n\nFirst in his class at West Point, hero of the Mexican War, Lee was the man to whom President Lincoln turned to lead his army. But when Virginia seceded, Lee would not lift up his sword against his own people, and chose to defend his home state rather than wage war upon her.\n\nThis veneration of Lee, wrote Richard Weaver, \"appears in the saying attributed to a Confederate soldier, 'The rest of us may have ... descended from monkeys, but it took a God to make Marse Robert.'\"\n\nGrowing up after World War II, this was accepted history.\n\nYet, on the militant left today, the name Lee evokes raw hatred and howls of \"racist and traitor.\" A clamor has arisen to have all statues of him and all Confederate soldiers and statesmen pulled down from their pedestals and put in museums or tossed onto trash piles.\n\nWhat has changed since 1965?\n\nIt is not history. There have been no great new discoveries about Lee.\n\nWhat has changed is America herself. She is not the same country. We have passed through a great social, cultural and moral revolution that has left us irretrievably divided on separate shores.\n\nAnd the politicians are in panic.\n\nTwo years ago, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe called the giant statues of Lee and \"Stonewall\" Jackson on Richmond's Monument Avenue \"parts of our heritage.\" After Charlottesville, New York-born-and-bred McAuliffe, entertaining higher ambitions, went full scalawag, demanding the statues be pulled down as \"flashpoints for hatred, division, and violence.\"\n\nWho hates the statues, Terry? Who's going to cause the violence? Answer: The Democratic left whom Terry must now appease.\n\nMcAuliffe is echoed by Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, the Democratic candidate in November to succeed McAuliffe. GOP nominee Ed Gillespie wants Monument Avenue left alone.\n\nThe election is the place to decide this, but the left will not wait.\n\nIn Durham, North Carolina, our Taliban smashed the statue of a Confederate soldier. Near the entrance of Duke University Chapel, a statue of Lee has been defaced, the nose broken off.\n\nWednesday at dawn, Baltimore carried out a cultural cleansing by taking down statues of Lee and Maryland Chief Justice Roger Taney who wrote the Dred Scott decision and opposed Lincoln's suspension of the right of habeas corpus.\n\nLike ISIS, which smashed the storied ruins of Palmyra, and the al-Qaida rebels who ravaged the fabled Saharan city of Timbuktu, the new barbarism has come to America. This is going to become a blazing issue, not only between but within the parties.\n\nFor there are 10 Confederates in Statuary Hall in the Capitol, among them Lee, Georgia's Alexander Stephens, vice president to Jefferson Davis, and Davis himself. The Black Caucus wants them gone.\n\nMount Rushmore-sized carvings of Lee, Jackson and Davis are on Stone Mountain, Georgia. Are they to be blasted off?\n\nThere are countless universities, colleges and high schools like Washington & Lee named for Confederate statesmen and soldiers. Across the Potomac from D.C. are Jefferson Davis Highway and Leesburg Pike to Leesburg itself, 25 miles north. Are all highways, streets, towns and counties named for Confederates to be renamed? What about Fort Bragg?\n\nOn every Civil War battlefield, there are monuments to the Southern fallen. Gettysburg has hundreds of memorials, statues and markers. But if, as the left insists we accept, the Confederates were traitors trying to tear America apart to preserve an evil system, upon what ground do Democrats stand to resist the radical left's demands?\n\nWhat do we do with those battlefields where Confederates were victorious: Bull Run, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville?\n\n\"Where does this all end?\" President Trump asked.\n\nIt doesn't. Not until America's histories and biographies are burned and new texts written to Nazify Lee, Jackson, Davis and all the rest, will a newly indoctrinated generation of Americans accede to this demand to tear down and destroy what their fathers cherished.\n\nAnd once all the Confederates are gone, one must begin with the explorers, and then the slave owners like Presidents Washington, Jefferson and Madison, who seceded from slave-free Britain. White supremacists all.\n\nAndrew Jackson, Henry Clay of Kentucky and John Calhoun must swiftly follow.\n\nThen there are all those segregationists. From 1865 to 1965, virtually all of the great Southern senators were white supremacists.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, Woodrow Wilson and FDR carried all 11 states of a rigidly segregationist South all six times they ran, and FDR rewarded Dixie by putting a Klansman on the Supreme Court.\n\nWhile easy for Republicans to wash their hands of such odious elements as Nazis in Charlottesville, will they take up the defense of the monuments and statues that have defined our history, or capitulate to the icon-smashers?\n\nIn this Second American Civil War, whose side are you

Lee -- and what a leader! . . . No military leader since Napoleon has aroused such enthusiastic devotion among troops as did Lee when he reviewed them on his horse Traveller.\"\n\nSo wrote Samuel Eliot Morison in his magisterial \"The Oxford History of the American People\" in 1965.\n\nFirst in his class at West Point, hero of the Mexican War, Lee was the man to whom President Lincoln turned to lead his army. But when Virginia seceded, Lee would not lift up his sword against his own people, and chose to defend his home state rather than wage war upon her.\n\nThis veneration of Lee, wrote Richard Weaver, \"appears in the saying attributed to a Confederate soldier, 'The rest of us may have . . . descended from monkeys, but it took a God to make Marse Robert.'\"\n\nGrowing up after World War II, this was accepted history.\n\nYet, on the militant left today, the name Lee evokes raw hatred and howls of \"racist and traitor.\" A clamor has arisen to have all statues of him and all Confederate soldiers and statesmen pulled down from their pedestals and put in museums or tossed onto trash piles.\n\nWhat has changed since 1965?\n\nIt is not history. There have been no great new discoveries about Lee.\n\nWhat has changed is America herself. She is not the same country. We have passed through a great social, cultural and moral revolution that has left us irretrievably divided on separate shores.\n\nAnd the politicians are in panic.\n\nTwo years ago, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe called the giant statues of Lee and \"Stonewall\" Jackson on Richmond's Monument Avenue \"parts of our heritage.\" After Charlottesville, New York-born-and-bred McAuliffe, entertaining higher ambitions, went full scalawag, demanding the statues be pulled down as \"flashpoints for hatred, division, and violence.\"\n\nWho hates the statues, Terry? Who's going to cause the violence? Answer: The Democratic left whom Terry must now appease.\n\nMcAuliffe is echoed by Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, the Democratic candidate in November to succeed McAuliffe. GOP nominee Ed Gillespie wants Monument Avenue left alone.\n\nThe election is the place to decide this, but the left will not wait.\n\nIn Durham, North Carolina, our Taliban smashed the statue of a Confederate soldier. Near the entrance of Duke University Chapel, a statue of Lee has been defaced, the nose broken off.\n\nWednesday at dawn, Baltimore carried out a cultural cleansing by taking down statues of Lee and Maryland Chief Justice Roger Taney who wrote the Dred Scott decision and opposed Lincoln's suspension of the right of habeas corpus.\n\nLike ISIS, which smashed the storied ruins of Palmyra, and the al-Qaida rebels who ravaged the fabled Saharan city of Timbuktu, the new barbarism has come to America. This is going to become a blazing issue, not only between but within the parties.\n\nFor there are 10 Confederates in Statuary Hall in the Capitol, among them Lee, Georgia's Alexander Stephens, vice president to Jefferson Davis, and Davis himself. The Black Caucus wants them gone.\n\nMount Rushmore-sized carvings of Lee, Jackson and Davis are on Stone Mountain, Georgia. Are they to be blasted off?\n\nThere are countless universities, colleges and high schools like Washington & Lee named for Confederate statesmen and soldiers. Across the Potomac from D.C. are Jefferson Davis Highway and Leesburg Pike to Leesburg itself, 25 miles north. Are all highways, streets, towns and counties named for Confederates to be renamed? What about Fort Bragg?\n\nOn every Civil War battlefield, there are monuments to the Southern fallen. Gettysburg has hundreds of memorials, statues and markers. But if, as the left insists we accept, the Confederates were traitors trying to tear America apart to preserve an evil system, upon what ground do Democrats stand to resist the radical left's demands?\n\nWhat do we do with those battlefields where Confederates were victorious: Bull Run, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville?\n\n\"Where does this all end?\" President Trump asked.\n\nIt doesn't. Not until America's histories and biographies are burned and new texts written to Nazify Lee, Jackson, Davis and all the rest, will a newly indoctrinated generation of Americans accede to this demand to tear down and destroy what their fathers cherished.\n\nAnd once all the Confederates are gone, one must begin with the explorers, and then the slave owners like Presidents Washington, Jefferson and Madison, who seceded from slave-free Britain. White supremacists all.\n\nAndrew Jackson, Henry Clay of Kentucky and John Calhoun must swiftly follow.\n\nThen there are all those segregationists. From 1865 to 1965, virtually all of the great Southern senators were white supremacists.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, Woodrow Wilson and FDR carried all 11 states of a rigidly segregationist South all six times they ran, and FDR rewarded Dixie by putting a Klansman on the Supreme Court.\n\nWhile easy for Republicans to wash their hands of such odious elements as Nazis in Charlottesville, will they take up the defense of the monuments and statues that have defined our history, or capitulate to the icon-smashers?\n\nIn this Second American Civil War, whose side are you on?\n\nPatrick Buchanan has been an adviser to three presidents, a two-time candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, and the nominee for the Reform Party in 2000. He was also a founding member of \"The McLaughlin Group,\" which began on NBC, and CNN's \"Capital Gang\" and \"Crossfire.\" His latest book is: \"The Greatest Comeback: How Richard Nixon Rose From

Lee is removed from Lee Circle Friday, May 19, 2017, in New Orleans. Lee's was the last of four monuments to Confederate-era figures to be removed under a 2015 City Council vote on a proposal by Mayor Mitch Landrieu. (AP Photo/Scott Threlkeld)\n\nGeorge Washington is one of the founding fathers of the United States of America and the country's first president. Robert E. Lee was the Confederate army general who fought on the wrong side of a bloody Civil War.\n\nThat's the simple reason why many Americans are lobbying to take down statues of Lee but not Washington monuments.\n\nBut in the aftermath of a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. -- supposedly organized to protest the removal of a Lee statue -- President Donald Trump has, in addition to blaming both the alt-right and the \"alt-left\" for the deadly clash that erupted, come out firmly against those who want to remove statues of Confederate leaders.\n\n\"This week it's Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson [another Confederate general] is coming down. I wonder is it George Washington next week and is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\" Trump said, mentioning past presidents Washington and Jefferson's history of owning slaves.\n\nIn a series of tweets Thursday morning, he added: \"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nThe current president's sudden obsession with Confederate statues has fuelled an ongoing national debate -- and revealed that many Americans, like Trump, don't see this as an obvious, clear-cut issue.\n\nAbout half of Americans disapproved of the removal of the Robert E. Lee statue from a park in Charlottesville, according to a recent YouGov poll, but a closer look shows the divide is broken out largely by political party or race. Far more Republicans (78 per cent) than Democrats (27 per cent) object to the statue's removal. Not surprisingly, far more whites (57 per cent) disapprove of Lee statues being taken down than blacks (11 per cent).\n\nWhy the division? After his death, Lee grew into the central figure of the South's \"Lost Cause\" narrative, which presents him as a hero of the South fighting for constitutional ideals, rather than the leader of a movement that sought to tear apart the United States in defence of slavery.\n\n\"These statues have morphed into a symbol of racism, a symbol of bigotry, a symbol of the alt-right, a symbol of white nationalist movements,\" explained Robert Wright Lee IV, one of Robert E. Lee's own descendants, in an interview with Huffington Post. \"It broke my heart to see a symbol of my family being used to allow such hate. All in the name of what my relative stood for.\" He believes it's time for statues of his great-great-great-great-uncle to come down.\n\nBut what about Trump's comments that by taking down these statues, America is \"changing history\" and \"changing culture\"?\n\nState leaders are unpersuaded that statues are the best way to remember these chapters in U.S. history. \"Our Civil War history is important, but it belongs in textbooks and museums -- not a place of allegiance on our Capitol grounds,\" wrote North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper in a statement posted on Medium.\n\nDefenders of Confederate monuments have noted that Washington and Jefferson were both slave owners, and suggested that statues of these leaders should also therefore be targeted. But there is a fundamental difference: Washington and Jefferson are mainly remembered for their efforts to build the country, whereas Lee's historical mark is based on his efforts to break the United States apart.\n\n\"This is not about the personality of an individual and his or her flaws,\" Annette Gordon-Reed, a history and law professor at Harvard University, told the New York Times. \"This is about men who organized a system of government to maintain a system of slavery and to destroy the American union.\"\n\nThat's the clear and simple reason efforts are underway across the nation to bring down Confederate monuments but not blow up half the faces on Mount Rushmore.\n\nAs for the Lee statue, one person who probably wouldn't have wanted them erected in the first place is Robert E. Lee himself. Before he died in 1870 -- years after the Civil War ended -- Lee advocated against any such memorials.\n\n\"As regards the erection of such a monument as is contemplated; my conviction is, that however grateful it would be to the feelings of the South, the attempt in the present condition of the Country, would have the effect of retarding, instead of accelerating its accomplishment; & of continuing, if not adding to, the difficulties under which the Southern people labour,\" Lee wrote in a letter dated 1866.\n\nThough Lee did add there was one place that should be protected to remember those who fought and died for the Confederates: their gravestones.\n\nFollow us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter", "id": "9765819", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "After Robert E.

Two letters written after the war show that Lee did not believe there should be monuments for the \"lost cause.\" As PBS notes, he wanted to see the U.S. move on from the war and swore allegiance to the Union after it ended.\n\nIn December 1866, a year after the war ended, Lee wrote to former Confederate General Thomas L. Rosser explained that he thought statues would hurt the country's post-war healing process. Lee wrote that it would be best to make sure that the graves of the fallen soldiers were at least protected.

Lee declined the invitation to mark troop movements on the battlefield, writing that it would be \"wiser... not to keep open the sores of war but to follow the examples of those nations who endeavored to obliterate the marks of civil strife, to commit to oblivion the feelings engendered.\" The letter was printed in full in the Republican Vindicator and was written on August 5, 1869.\n\nDear Sir-Absence from Lexington has prevented my receiving until to-day your letter of the 26th ult., inclosing an invitation from the Gettysburg Battle-field Memorial Association, to attend a meeting of the officers engaged in that battle at Gettysburg, for the purpose of marking upon the ground by enduring memorials of granite the positions and movements of the armies on the field. My engagements will not permit me to be present. I believe if there, I could not add anything material to the information existing on the subject. I think it wiser, moreover, not to keep open the sores of war but to follow the examples of those nations who endeavored to obliterate the marks of civil strife, to commit to oblivion the feelings engendered. Very respectfully,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. E. Lee.\n\nThe letters Lee wrote over 140 years ago have attracted newfound attention in the days since the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia on August 12 led to the deaths of a woman and two police officers. White supremacists gathered there to protest the planned removal of a Robert E. Lee Statue.\n\nRobert E. Lee V, the great-great grandson of Lee, told CNN that it would be more \"appropriate\" for Confederate statues to be in a museum.\n\n\"Eventually, someone is going to have to make a decision, and if that's the local lawmaker, so be it. But we have to be able to have that conversation without all of the hatred and the violence. And if they choose to take those statues down, fine,\" the 54-year-old Lee, who lives in Washington D.C., told CNN. \"Maybe it's appropriate to have them in museums or to put them in some sort of historical context in that regard.\"\n\nRobert E. Lee V also told CNN that the acts of violence in Charlottesville were \"senseless\" and believes that General Lee would not have endorsed the violence.\n\nLee was a West Point graduate and the son of a Revolutionary War officer. He also fought in the Mexican-American War. Lee's letters showed that he opposed secession early on, but he decided to fight for his state of Virginia when it seceded instead of remaining in the Union Army. Lee was a slave owner, but he once wrote to his wife that slavery is a \"moral and political evil in any country.\" But in that same letter, Lee wrote, \"The painful discipline they (blacks) are undergoing is necessary for their instruction as a race.\"\n\nIn 1870, Lee wrote that he is \"rejoiced\" to see slavery end.\n\n\"So far from engaging in a war to perpetuate slavery, I am rejoiced that slavery is abolished. I believe it will be greatly for the interests of the South,\" Lee wrote. \"So fully am I satisfied of this, as regards Virginia especially, that I would cheerfully have lost all I have lost by the war, and have suffered all I have suffered, to have this object attained.\"\n\nIn a series of tweets Thursday, Trump wrote that he is against removing Confederate statues.\n\n\"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he wrote. \"You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!

Lee, whose statue was at the center of the \"alt-right\" protest in Charlottesville, was very clear on his position. According to Lee biographer Jonathan Horn, \"So sensitive was Lee during his final years with extinguishing the fiery passions of the Civil War that he opposed erecting monuments on the battlefields where the Southern soldiers under his command had fought against the Union.\"\n\nLee wrote:\n\n\"I think it wiser moreover not to keep open the sores of war, but to follow the examples of those nations who endeavoured to obliterate the marks of civil strife and to commit to oblivion the feelings it engendered.\"\n\nSo strong were Lee's feelings that he refused to have Confederate flags at his funeral and was not buried in his Confederate uniforms; his soldiers also didn't don their uniforms at the funeral. Lee's daughter said that having those symbols present would almost be \"treasonous,\" as her father had take an oath to support the U.S. Constitution the day he took office as president of Washington College (now knows as Washington and Lee University). Lee urged his fellow Confederates to do the same.\n\n\"As regards the erection of such a monument as is contemplated, my conviction is, that however grateful it would be to the feelings of the South, the attempt in the present condition of the Country, would have the effect of retarding, instead of accelerating its accomplishment; [and] of continuing, if not adding to, the difficulties under which the Southern people labour.\"\n\nSo, here we are, 150 years later, still having the same conversation.

Lee V is the great-great-grandson of Gen. Robert E. Lee. The D.C. resident is also the longtime boys' athletic director at the Potomac School in McLean, Va., which my children attend. I visited Lee in his office to talk about the role that his name, and the historical monuments that bear it, has played in the last week. Edited excerpts follow.\n\nQuestion: The statues of Robert E. Lee have become a lightning rod. It's your name on the statues. Wherever you go, south of the Mason-Dixon Line, there's a Robert E. Lee statue or a Robert E. Lee Highway or a Robert E. Lee whatever. What do you think now of the reexamination of that legacy?\n\nFirst and foremost, if it can avoid any days like this past Saturday in Charlottesville, then take them down today. That's not what our family is at all interested in, and that's not what we think General Lee would want whatsoever. .\u2009.\u2009. And maybe the second step is put these statues in some place where there is historical context, like a museum, and people can talk about the context. Put it in context of the 1860s and the 1800s, so people better understand the times they [Civil War figures] lived in.\n\nCharlottesville is a place where you send students you know and love every year to play ball, to matriculate. What were your thoughts when you were watching Saturday unfold?\n\nWe were on vacation in Lake Tahoe. We were having a little family reunion. We had very little cell service, and Willie Crittenberger -- my nephew, he's living in Chicago now -- went down to the lake and he could get more cell service down there. And he comes back and he says, \"There's something going on in Charlottesville. Twitter is sort of blowing up.\" So we really didn't know what was going on in real time.\n\nBut it's such a tragic event. And I just hate for some people to hide behind Robert E. Lee's name. Saying we are doing this for him and for the South, and that's not at all what he stood for. He is one who said immediately after the war to put your arms down and let's bring this nation back together -- not divide it even further.\n\nIs that what you think? That people are hiding behind his name?\n\nI can't tell you the reasoning behind the KKK or the right extremists, but when they hide behind the Confederate flag and General Lee. .\u2009.\u2009. [He let that idea hang in the air.]\n\nYou think they're misunderstanding or misrepresenting his legacy?\n\nI don't think they understand his legacy at all. I understand that it's easy for Robert E. Lee V to be saying this, but we were never taught in our family that Robert E. Lee was fighting for slavery. He was fighting for the state of Virginia and for his homeland. He was never fighting to keep the institution of slavery alive.\n\nHe owned slaves, though.\n\nHe did. Absolutely did. That's what's so confusing about this. And that's why you hear stories about Thomas Jefferson and George Washington and General Lee. They are just men of their times. .\u2009.\u2009. It was a horrendous institution. A mar on history. If General Lee's statue or name is that divisive, you need to take that down.\n\nSo the name itself is obviously very important to your family. You're the fifth.\n\nMy father is still alive. He's awesome. He's 92. .\u2009.\u2009. And then I'm the fifth and we have a son. He's the sixth.\n\nWhat does he think?\n\nHe'd rather talk about Bryce Harper's injury than any of this. He recognizes though, to his credit, what is going on. He says, \"What going on? Why all the violence? Why all the hatred?\" Because to us, that is not at all what General Lee stood for. He would be appalled today.\n\nHas anyone in New Orleans or Charlottesville or any of these places that are grappling with this reached out to your family?\n\nSome of the news media has. Like MSNBC, CNN. But not any of the lawmakers or anything like that. And you know honestly, I think it's a community-wide decision, and the communities need to figure this out. .\u2009.\u2009. [The Baltimore mayor] said they had long discussions about it and decided to do it at night, but it had been teed up for a while.\n\nIt needs to happen there -- in the community. We can offer our insights. I'm sure Robert E. Lee High School here in Fairfax isn't going to be Robert E. Lee High School for much longer. If that makes sense to that community, then fine. But I also would say that I hope we don't paint him out as some figure who was fighting for slavery.\n\nWhat would he think of the statues?\n\nHe was extremely modest. John Kowalik [head of Potomac School] was telling me a story a few weeks ago that I had forgotten. When General Lee became president of Washington College, now Washington and Lee, they asked if they could make it Washington and Lee when he was still the president there, and he said no.\n\nThere are six Robert E. Lees in your family. The name is obviously meaningful to the family.\n\nNone of my friends would even know the legacy. To them I'm Rob Lee, and they could absolutely care less. But when we named [my son] Robert E. Lee VI, we were doing it in recognition of my father and his father. And yeah, down the road to General Lee. No question. .\u2009.\u2009. I don't think it was about the perpetuation of keeping the name alive, like, \"By God, we've got to keep the name going.\" You know, it was more like, \"It's a wonderful family name, and we're going to recognize it as that.\"\n\nWhen you were growing up and your son Robbie was growing up and your father was growing up, there were all these monuments wherever you go and all these highways named for your family.\n\nDuring spring break, we went down to Hilton Head, South Carolina, and as you head down there, when you get to Richmond [and south], you give your Visa card to the gas station attendant or to the restaurant owner, and it's remarkable the reaction. .\u2009.\u2009. He was the losing general of this major war in our country, and people have such incredible respect for him. People will see your name, and they always have good things to say.\n\nBut we are not going to live our lives that way. We are not professional Robert E. Lees. .\u2009.\u2009. We spend very, very, very little time talking about General Lee.\n\nPresident Trump said that when the Robert E. Lee statue goes down, then Jefferson is next and then Washington. What do you think of that comparison?\n\nI don't really know what to say about President Trump. If I had to say something, I'd just say I wish he came out stronger Saturday afternoon. I think I'll just leave it at that.\n\nThe people who organized the march in Charlottesville did so in your ancestor's name.\n\nThey said this was a march just to [oppose taking] this statue down? .\u2009.\u2009. Nothing wrong with that viewpoint. But I don't really know that that was the goal of these people. They wanted to be on the cable news networks for 72 hours straight and to have a platform to say some ugly things. To have a peaceful protest is one thing. To have a day of violence is another.\n\nWhat about the rest of their message? \"Blood and soil.\" And \"Jews will not replace us\"?\n\nWhat? What? I don't understand that. I think that's misrepresenting his name. That's not what General Lee stood for. And I know that's not what we stand for as a family. .\u2009.\u2009. If you want to have a conversation about taking the statue down, then terrific. Have a town hall meeting at the University of Virginia football stadium, and have a conversation about it and debate it and let the lawmakers make some tough decisions. And if the Lee family or other families with Confederate ancestry can help with that, we're happy to. But dear God, we have to avoid days like Saturday in Charlottesville.\n\nRead more from Outlook and follow our updates on Facebook and Twitter.", "id": "9749990", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Perspective | Robert E.

Lee, which sits in a local public park.\n\nHowever, the controversy feeds into a much wider debate that is as old as the United States itself. So who was Lee and why does a memorial to him trouble so many people?\n\nThe meeting of white supremacists in Charlottesville was originally held under the pretext of demonstrating against plans to remove the statue.\n\nThe Charlottesville city council voted in February for it to be removed from the recently renamed Emancipation Park (formerly Lee Park).\n\nThe decision came as part of a movement to challenge the ubiquity of Confederate symbols in the South.\n\nThese statues, for their opponents, signify the oppression of African Americans under slavery and the Jim Crow segregation laws.\n\nThey serve as daily reminders of the vulnerability of black people. The message of such monuments is the same to many of their defenders, even if their interpretation is different.\n\nTo the white supremacists who gathered on the streets of Charlottesville, the statue of Lee represents white military and political power.\n\nIn the decades after the Civil War, memorials celebrating the south's valiant effort and glorious defeat appeared all over the region.\n\nThey embodied the myth of the \"lost cause\" - the idea that the war had been fought to defend states' rights, rather than slavery.\n\nIn this interpretation, the south only lost because of the industrial might of the northern \"aggressor\".\n\nThis doctrine came to prominence during the Jim Crow era when whites implemented racial segregation through violent, extra-legal and then legal means.\n\nThe lost cause memory was used to justify and enforce white supremacy.\n\nFor many, the Confederate memorials continue to represent this repression. They are a celebration of southern identity as white.\n\nSince the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, the slogan \"BLM\", as well as the names of victims of police shootings have appeared on memorials around the country.\n\n\"Black Lives Matter\" was sprayed on Charlottesville's Lee statue in the days following the Charleston church shootings in 2015.\n\nAlong with calls for the removal of Confederate flags from civic buildings there have been increasingly vocal, and successful, demands to reconsider the place of monuments in public spaces.\n\nWho was Robert E. Lee?\n\nThe statue in Charlottesville is of Lee atop his horse, Traveller. The Confederate general and native of Virginia holds a hat in one hand and his horse's reins in the other, his sword ready at his side.\n\nIt was unveiled by Lee's great-granddaughter at a ceremony in May 1924. As was the custom on these occasions it was accompanied by a parade and speeches.\n\nIn the dedication address, Lee was celebrated as a hero, who embodied \"the moral greatness of the Old South\", and as a proponent of reconciliation between the two sections.\n\nThe war itself was remembered as a conflict between \"interpretations of our Constitution\" and between \"ideals of democracy.\"\n\nHere was the states' rights argument. The south fought a noble war over its right to self-determination, rather than an effort to keep millions enslaved.\n\nLee, claimed one of the speakers, \"abhorred slavery\". In his position as commander of the Confederate Army of North Virginia, Lee represented military endeavour rather than a political struggle to uphold human bondage.\n\nThis has made Lee a powerful symbol of the Confederacy. He allowed white southerners to ignore the central role of slavery in the war.\n\nThey could forget that the southern states seceded in order to uphold slavery and that their defeat meant freedom to millions of enslaved people.\n\nThere was no space for black memories of emancipation in the south's public spaces. Confederates were white and their monuments were celebrations of whiteness.\n\nLee is one of the most frequent figures to be memorialised in statues, aside from the common soldier.\n\nIn 2016, the Southern Poverty Law Center catalogued all publicly supported spaces dedicated to the Confederacy, finding 203 examples named for Robert E. Lee.\n\nStreets, highways, counties, cities, parks, monuments and 52 public schools are named for the Confederate general.\n\nUp until 2015, Lee's birthday was officially marked in five states.\n\nThe same year as Lee's statue appeared in Charlottesville, Virginia passed laws which strengthened definitions of who was \"colored\" and who was \"white\", and which reinforced the law prohibiting interracial marriage.\n\nThen, two years later, the state passed a law to enforce racial segregation in places of public entertainment.\n\nThe monument to Lee served the same purpose as the legislation - to remind African Americans of their perceived place and inferiority.\n\nWhite nationalists gathered to protect the statue in 2017 because they wanted to celebrate its message.\n\nLike the original creators and supporters of the Lee monument, they sought to celebrate a white supremacist vision not just of the past, but of the present.", "id": "9895765", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "The history of the statue at the centre of Charlottesville unrest", "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_300,f_auto,ar_3:2,c_fill/http://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4535881.1503060167!/image/image.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charleston"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "196346", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina", "label": {"eng": "Charleston"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "242096", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Law"}, "id": "302557", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"}, {"label": {"eng": "Human"}, "id": "302854", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"}, {"location": null, "score": 4, "id": "302937", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States", "label": {"eng": "Southern United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Politics"}, "id": "302948", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "White people"}, "id": "303415", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"}, {"label": {"eng": "Statue"}, "id": "303774", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue"}, {"label": {"eng": "Democracy"}, "id": "303921", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Horse"}, "id": "304107", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse"}, {"label": {"eng": "Black people"}, "id": "304217", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people"}, {"label": {"eng": "African American"}, "id": "304393", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"}, {"label": {"eng": "Power (social and political)"}, "id": "304683", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(social_and_political)"}, {"label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}, "id": "305954", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "id": "305960", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racial segregation"}, "id": "307630", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Self-determination"}, "id": "309156", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination"}, {"label": {"eng": "Slavery"}, "id": "309898", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery"}, {"label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "id": "318253", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Secession"}, "id": "328866", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession"}, {"label": {"eng": "Northern Virginia"}, "id": "333030", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Virginia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flags of the Confederate States of America"}, "id": "354872", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert E.

Lee to George Washington. But when Trump defends Confederate monuments, he misses the point. True, Lee and Washington were both Generals who fought on American soil. But Washington fought for the United States of America, while Lee fought against it. The full screed: \"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You ... can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also ... the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!\"\n\nTrump's statement that \"you can't change history\" is accurate, but removing statues is not an attempt change history; it's changing the way we remember it. Erecting monuments to men who committed atrocities fueled by hate glorifies them as heroes. Germany will never forget Hitler, but there are no monuments to him on public land. In the United States, however, over 700 monuments to the Confederacy still stand, according to FiveThirtyEight.\n\nTrump's tweets echo his statements to the press on Tuesday, when he characterized white supremacists and Neo-Nazis as \"very fine people\" who were \"protesting very quietly\" when \"the left, that came, violently attacking the other group.\" These innocent people, he claimed, were innocently objecting to the removal of a statue of Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia. According to NPR, Trump pondered, \"I wonder, is it George Washington next week and is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\" This slippery slope fallacy also appeared in an email Trump's attorney, John Dowd, sent to journalists on Wednesday morning. The New York Times reported that the email claimed that there is \"literally is no difference between\" Lee and Washington, because \"both saved America.\"\n\nOnce you've recovered from that ridiculous characterization, consider the fact that Lee was actually opposed to erecting Civil War memorials, writing in an 1869 letter, \"I think it wiser, moreover, not to keep open the sores of war but to follow the examples of those nations who endeavored to obliterate the marks of civil strife, to commit to oblivion the feelings engendered.\" Why would Lee want to be reminded of a war in which he was outmanned and outmaneuvered from start to finish, leading hundreds thousands of his soldiers to their deaths before ultimately surrendering?\n\nLee apologists claim that the Confederate general wasn't fighting for slavery, but the fact is that he did indeed enslave and brutally torture black people. In an 1856 letter excerpted by The Atlantic, Lee defended this practice: \"The blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally, socially & physically. The painful discipline they are undergoing, is necessary for their instruction as a race, & I hope will prepare & lead them to better things.\" Lee wasn't a hero; he was a traitor.

Lee, which sits in a local park. However, the controversy feeds into a much wider debate that is as old as the US itself. So who was Lee and why does a memorial to him trouble so many people?\n\nThe meeting of white supremacists in Charlottesville was originally held under the pretext of demonstrating against plans to remove the statue. The Charlottesville city council voted in February for it to be removed from the recently renamed Emancipation Park (formerly Lee Park). The decision came as part of a movement to challenge the ubiquity of Confederate symbols in the South.\n\nThese statues, for their opponents, signify the oppression of African Americans under slavery and the Jim Crow segregation laws. They serve as daily reminders of the vulnerability of black people. The message of such monuments is the same to many of their defenders, even if their interpretation is different. To the white supremacists who gathered on the streets of Charlottesville, the statue of Lee represents white military and political power.\n\nAlong with calls for the removal of Confederate flags from civic buildings there have been increasingly vocal, and successful, demands to reconsider the place of monuments in public spaces.\n\nThe statue in Charlottesville is of Lee atop his horse, Traveller. The Confederate general and native of Virginia holds a hat in one hand and his horse's reins in the other, his sword ready at his side.\n\nIt was unveiled by Lee's great-granddaughter at a ceremony in May 1924. As was the custom on these occasions it was accompanied by a parade and speeches.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLee, claimed one of the speakers, \"abhorred slavery\". In his position as commander of the Confederate Army of North Virginia, Lee represented military endeavour rather than a political struggle to uphold human bondage.\n\nYou will now receive updates from Breaking News Alert Breaking News Alert\n\nGet the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy .\n\nThis has made Lee a powerful symbol of the Confederacy. He allowed white southerners to ignore the central role of slavery in the war. They could forget that the southern states seceded in order to uphold slavery and that their defeat meant freedom to millions of enslaved people.\n\nLee is one of the most frequent figures to be memorialised in statues, aside from the common soldier. In 2016, the Southern Poverty Law Centre catalogued all publicly supported spaces dedicated to the Confederacy, finding 203 examples named for Robert E. Lee. Streets, highways, counties, cities, parks, monuments and 52 public schools are named for the Confederate general. Up until 2015, Lee's birthday was officially marked in five states.\n\nThe same year as Lee's statue appeared in Charlottesville, Virginia passed laws that strengthened definitions of who was \"coloured\" and who was \"white\", and which reinforced the law prohibiting interracial marriage. Then, two years later, the state passed a law to enforce racial segregation in places of public entertainment.\n\nThe monument to Lee served the same purpose as the legislation - to remind African Americans of their perceived place and inferiority. White nationalists gathered to protect the statue in 2017 because they wanted to celebrate its message. Like the original creators and supporters of the Lee monument, they sought to celebrate a white supremacist vision not just of the past, but of the present.\n\nJenny Woodley, lecturer in modern American history, Nottingham Trent University\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

But underlying it all was one rationale: That the war had ended, and the South needed to move on and avoid more upheaval.\n\n\"As regards the erection of such a monument as is contemplated,\" Lee wrote of an 1866 proposal, \"my conviction is, that however grateful it would be to the feelings of the South, the attempt in the present condition of the Country, would have the effect of retarding, instead of accelerating its accomplishment; [and] of continuing, if not adding to, the difficulties under which the Southern people labour.\"\n\nThe retired Confederate leader, a West Point graduate, was influenced by his knowledge of history.\n\n\"Lee believed countries that erased visible signs of civil war recovered from conflicts quicker,\" Horn said. \"He was worried that by keeping these symbols alive, it would keep the divisions alive.\"\n\nIn that same letter, Lee also wrote (my emphasis added):\n\nAll I think that can now be done, is to aid our noble & generous women in their efforts to protect the graves & mark the last resting places of those who have fallen, & wait for better times.\n\nThat, I reckon, is key.\n\nI sympathize with the objections to keeping statues of the leading Confederate figures on public land, not least when they are in a prominent place. It's not difficult to see why those who want to get rid of them are so determined to do so, most importantly, of course, due to the real nature of the Lost Cause, but also because of the war's long, long afterlife after the end of Reconstruction, an afterlife that has barely drawn to a close.\n\nIt's equally easy to understand -- although in my view they have the weaker argument -- why many locals have rallied to the defense of what they see as their heritage -- even if that heritage is often represented by statues erected decades after war they supposedly commemorate (that they had another message is difficult to deny).\n\nAs for those who have come from outside the South to exploit this situation, that these particular carpetbaggers chose to signal their presence by flying the Nazi flag -- the flag of a genocidal regime that so many Americans of both North and South gave their lives to destroy -- is revolting. These are not allies that anyone wishing to defend these statues should want.\n\nSo what to do?\n\nThe first thing to say is that, wherever possible, this is a decision for locals to take: If the monument is on state property, the state should decide, if it's on city property, the city should decide, and so on. It is not for a largely leftist mob, elected by no one, like the group that tore down the Confederate monument in Durham, N.C., to decide what stands and what falls.\n\nMany of the monuments are modest, statues of individual, unknown soldiers, a device used to symbolize military sacrifice, for good causes and bad, on both sides of the Atlantic for over a century. In many cases, the best place for them would be with their fallen comrades in those areas of a cemetery dedicated to the Confederate dead. To take an example from Eastern Europe, where a battle of monuments has been fought since the Soviet collapse, there is the case of the bronze soldier of Tallinn.\n\nThe first time I visited the Estonian capital, Tallinn, almost exactly two years after Estonia won back its independence from the Soviets, I noticed a monument near the city center featuring a little more than life sized bronze statue of a Red Army soldier with gently bowed head. Originally known as the \"Monument to the Liberators of Tallinn\", it was an insult to the many Estonians who regarded the Red Army's return to their country in 1944 not as a liberation but as the resumption of the USSR's earlier occupation of their homeland - a murderous interlude that had been a product of the squalid deal Stalin cut with Hitler in 1939. No liberation, the early years of the country's reoccupation were marked by savage repression which over time eased into a slower strangling of any idea of revived Estonian independence.\n\nBut if the bronze soldier was an affront to numerous ethnic Estonians, to Tallinn's large ethnic Russian population (occupation-era settlers or their descendants) it was a symbol of the enormous sacrifices made by the Soviet people in the war against Hitler.\n\nThe statue continued to stand even after the Soviet Union collapsed. Finally, in 2007, the Estonian government, amid protests that quickly turned violent, moved the bronze soldier to Tallinn's military cemetery (Soviet soldiers are amongst the dead buried there). If ethnic Russians want to pay their respects they can (and do), but the affront that the statue represented to many Estonians has largely been defused: Out of sight, out (more or less) of mind.\n\nNot a solution for purists, but it seems to work.\n\nAs for the larger Confederate statues, some may belong on the civil war battlefields.\n\nTo quote Rich's article from the New York Post:\n\nThe Baltimore commission has called for moving a striking dual statue of Lee and Stonewall Jackson to the Chancellorsville, Va., battlefield where the two last met before Jackson's death. This would be appropriate, and take a page from the Gettysburg battlefield. A statue of Lee commemorates Virginia's losses and overlooks the field where Gen. George Pickett undertook his doomed charge. If you can't honor Robert E. Lee there, you can't honor him anywhere.For some on the left, that's the right answer, but this unsparing attitude rejects the generosity of spirit of the two great heroes of the war, Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant. Notably, Grant vehemently opposed trying Lee for treason.\n\nOf the other larger monuments, some may belong where they now stand, but perhaps displayed in a way that gives better context. Others should go to museums or storehouses. And some -- those without any artistic merit or historic interest -- should be scrapped or sold. But it must be for the locals to make the final decision.", "id": "9656149", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Confederate Statues and the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn, by Andrew Stuttaford, National Review", "image": "http://c5.nrostatic.com/sites/default/files/charlottesville-robert-lee-statue-home.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Estonia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "63", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Estonia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Estonia"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Tallinn"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "15764", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallinn", "label": {"eng": "Tallinn"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "189313", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "193144", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "242096", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nazism"}, "id": "302813", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "303033", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe", "label": {"eng": "Eastern Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}, "id": "303042", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "id": "303819", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II"}, {"location": null, "score": 4, "id": "304165", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Afterlife"}, "id": "304366", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterlife"}, {"label": {"eng": "Reconstruction Era"}, "id": "305145", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bronze"}, "id": "305771", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze"}, {"label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}, "id": "305954", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "id": "305960", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "Joseph Stalin"}, "id": "307182", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin"}, {"label": {"eng": "New York Post"}, "id": "307948", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post"}, {"label": {"eng": "Russians"}, "id": "308376", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians"}, {"label": {"eng": "Estonian language"}, "id": "310721", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_language"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adolf Hitler"}, "id": "311203", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dissolution of the Soviet Union"}, "id": "315478", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "PBS"}, "id": "318988", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carpetbagger"}, "id": "319818", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpetbagger"}, {"label": {"eng": "Red Army"}, "id": "326543", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army"}, {"label": {"eng": "Division (military)"}, "id": "338606", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(military)"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Military Academy"}, "id": "348000", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Military_Academy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Estonians"}, "id": "354995", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonians"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert E.

The so-called Islamic State has made it part of its mission to destroy ancient monuments like they did in Palmyra, Syria. They do it because they see them as an insult and a violation of their extreme interpretation of Islam.\n\nThe Taliban did it in Afghanistan, blowing up the Buddhas of Bamiyan, the statues carved into the cliffs back in the 4th and 5th centuries. The Taliban considered them offensive to their religious beliefs.\n\nREAD MORE: Russian drone footage shows destruction of UNESCO sites in Syria\n\nWe consider it the destruction of the world's cultural heritage. We think of those ancient monuments as precious and believe they should be preserved. President Trump seems to believes something similar -- that once you've got it, you keep it.\n\nSo what is the value of a statue? Is it really about the statue or monument itself, something erected so long ago that -- let's face it -- many people no longer even recognize the person or know the full history. They evolve into symbols, and in some cases can be powerful symbols of wrongs committed in the past.\n\nThat's the case with the Confederate statues and monuments erected in the United States after the Civil War. Some say they mark history and honour heritage. Others say they are racist reminders of America's dark history of slavery and belief by some in white supremacy.\n\nAt the heart of the violence in Charlottesville, Va. was the statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. It was erected in 1924, 59 years after the end of the Civil War, and during what had been a time of extreme racial violence.\n\nSouthern whites pushed back against what little progress had been made by African-Americans in the decades after the Civil War. The body count of black men, women and children who were lynched went up the same time as many Confederate monuments did.\n\nREAD MORE: Donald Trump wrong to link General Lee with founding fathers, scholars say\n\nLee himself -- who died just five years after the Civil War -- resisted efforts to build monuments in his honour and instead wanted the nation to move on from the Civil War. He was clear about what he thought of memorials to failed insurrections.\n\n\"I think it wiser,\" he wrote in an 1869 letter, \"not to keep open the sores of war but to follow the examples of those nations who endeavored to obliterate the marks of civil strife, to commit to oblivion the feelings engendered.\"\n\nThe great-great grandson of Lee said this week he doesn't mind if the statue comes down. He told CNN that his family \"feels strongly that General Lee would never stand for that sort of violence.\" And he added that \"maybe it's appropriate to have them in museums or to put them in some sort of historical context.\"\n\nThat seems wise.\n\nHistory is certainly a great teacher and in our fast-paced modern world driven by the distraction of clickbait, we tend not to have time for it.

The removal of statues won't heal what's wrong in the United States. ISIS and the Taliban ripping down and blowing up world heritage sites may have made them feel powerful, but it hasn't aided their cause or helped spread their beliefs.\n\nAnd if all the Confederate memorials were ripped down this week, the problems with race and inequality will still exist within the United States.\n\nDawna Friesen is the anchor of Global National, the flagship national newscast for Global News.", "id": "9800625", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Analysis: Removing Confederate symbols won't fix America's race and inequality issues", "image": "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/16737362.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=720&h=480&crop=1", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "2", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "212", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Tadmur"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "4888", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmyra", "label": {"eng": "Tadmur"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islamic State of Iraq"}, "id": "303094", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "id": "303218", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Taliban"}, "id": "303355", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban"}, {"label": {"eng": "Black people"}, "id": "304217", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cnn.com"}, "id": "304269", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN"}, {"label": {"eng": "African American"}, "id": "304393", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"}, {"label": {"eng": "Reconstruction Era"}, "id": "305145", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era"}, {"label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}, "id": "305954", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "id": "305960", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Global News"}, "id": "309724", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_News"}, {"label": {"eng": "Slavery"}, "id": "309898", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cultural heritage"}, "id": "310406", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_heritage"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Heritage Site"}, "id": "321440", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lynching"}, "id": "329995", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert E.

Robert Wright Lee IV hands his credit card to a department store cashier, he braces for the question: Are you related to Gen. Robert E. Lee?\n\nIn the past, he has hesitated to answer, though the answer is yes. Lee is his great-great-great-great uncle.\n\n\"At the checkout counter, you don't always want to get into a conversation about how proud somebody is of their Confederate history, and how the South will rise again,\" Lee said.\n\nBut this week, he is acknowledging his family ties to say it's time to move monuments of his ancestor into museums where they can be used more to educate than to inflame. He has given an interview to HuffPost and is scheduled to be on NPR's \"Weekend Edition.\"\n\n\"I don't speak for the rest of my family,\" said Lee in a phone interview. He's a North Carolina native who grew up in Statesville.\n\n\"But for some of us, it's hard to sit here while our relative is being used as a symbol for hate and white supremacy,\" he said.\n\nLee, 24, has ties to the Triangle. He graduated in May from Duke Divinity School with a master's in theology and was a pastoral intern at Edenton Street United Methodist Church in Raleigh. He now serves as an adjunct professor at Appalachian State University and as pastor at a United Church of Christ in Winston-Salem.\n\nHe said he first began to speak out about the use of Confederate symbols after white supremacist Dylann Roof walked into a church in Charleston, S.C., in June 2015 and fired 70 rounds into a group at a Bible study, killing nine people. After his arrest, photos of Roof were found of him posed with Confederate flags.\n\nA public debate ensued then about South Carolina's practice of flying the Confederate flag over its State Capitol, and 23 days after the shootings, the state removed the flag.\n\nOn Saturday, Charlottesville, Va., made national news when white supremacists who gathered for a \"Unite the Right\" rally clashed violently with counter-protesters. The original rally was called by white nationalists to protest plans by the City of Charlottesville to remove an oversized bronze likeness of Robert E. Lee from a public park.\n\n\"These neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan and others, they have made him into an idol,\" Lee said of his famous ancestor. \"And it's unacceptable on a lot of levels. As a pastor, I feel it's my obligation to speak out from the pulpit and say, 'Supremacy was never God's plan for our lives.'\n\n\"We have to speak up and speak out in God's name.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Lee was going to be a guest preacher at Broad Street United Methodist Church in Statesville.\n\nHe already had prepared a sermon when he heard the news that the protests in Charlottesville had turned violent and that a self-identified Nazi had driven his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing one and injuring 19 others.\n\n\"I completely changed my sermon,\" he said. \"As a white male, I knew I couldn't do justice to what was going on. But I can begin the conversation by acknowledging my white privilege. You have to say that enough is enough. We have to be part of the solution by speaking up, instead of being part of the problem with our silence.\"\n\nEarlier this week, a crowd of protesters gathered around a Confederate monument in Durham and pulled it to the ground. The City of Baltimore quietly removed several Confederate monuments from public grounds there overnight.\n\nLee said he hopes the monuments won't be destroy. Most were installed by white governments or civic groups during periods when blacks were fighting for increased civil rights.\n\n\"There is a difference between remembering our past, and commemorating our past,\" he said. \"We should never celebrate the history that was slavery, but we can remember it, and remember that it can never happen again.\"", "id": "9742183", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Robert E.

Lee if moderate Americans desire to seek a middle ground solution. The facts are that one side of the ongoing debate wants all Confederate statues torn down, with some groups like the Take 'Em Down NOLA Coalition saying even historical monuments honoring George Washington should be taken down since the first president of the United States \"was a slave master.\" On the other hand, we have people wanting the history of the Civil War to be remembered, or there are those where Confederate symbols represent culture, but racist groups and white supremacists perceive the Confederate monuments as a rallying cry. How do you bridge that great divide?\n\nThe extremists on both sides will probably never both be happy with any proposed solution, but it does seem obvious that there are reasonable arguments for replacing the Robert E. Lee statues. In modern times, the Confederate general is touted as a folk hero who morally opposed slavery and did not desire the secession of the Confederacy. Few people remember how Lee turned down an offer from President Abraham Lincoln to command the Union forces because of his prior commitment to his beloved state of Virginia. After the Civil War ended, Lee did, in fact, swear allegiance to the Union, tried to unify the country, and decried southern separatism, but there was a darker side to Lee that can't be glossed over.\n\nRecently, Dinesh D'Souza claimed on Twitter that General Lee \"opposed both slavery and secession\" because the Confederate leader had once written a letter in which he called slavery a \"moral and political evil.\" The Daily Caller fact checked that statement, calling it false because Lee's actual thoughts on slavery were more complex when the letter is put in its full context.\n\nEven has he proclaimed the evils of slavery, Robert E. Lee was a slave owner himself. He attempted to reconcile this moral paradox by claiming slavery was a necessity for black people to be civilized.\n\n\"I think it however a greater evil to the white man than to the black race, and while my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more strong for the former. The blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally, socially and physically. The painful discipline they are undergoing, is necessary for their instruction as a race, and I hope will prepare and lead them to better things. How long their subjugation may be necessary is known and ordered by a wise Merciful Providence. Their emancipation will sooner result from the mild and melting influence of Christianity, than the storms and tempests of fiery Controversy.\"\n\nAccording to The Atlantic, after the American Civil War was over, Lee denied that the war was fought over slavery, but even if it was, then \"it was only out of Christian devotion that white southerners fought to keep blacks enslaved.\" During an interview with a reporter of the era, Lee argued in favor of blacks being \"disposed of\" from the South, yet he also claimed that \"based on wisdom and Christian principles you do a gross wrong and injustice to the whole negro race in setting them free. And it is only this consideration that has led the wisdom, intelligence and Christianity of the South to support and defend the institution up to this time.\"\n\nLee's other letters were similarly contradictory in nature, on one hand denigrating black people while also claiming to wish them well. In one letter, he gave his reasons for advising others to hire white laborers rather than give a job to freed slaves.\n\n\"You will never prosper with blacks, and it is abhorrent to a reflecting mind to be supporting and cherishing those who are plotting and working for your injury, and all of whose sympathies and associations are antagonistic to yours. I wish them no evil in the world -- on the contrary, will do them every good in my power, and know that they are misled by those to whom they have given their confidence; but our material, social, and political interests are naturally with the whites.\"\n\nThere is practically a list of reasons why General Lee is not the best candidate for remembering the history of the Civil War and the Confederacy. Lee was known for separating slave families, a terrible practice that did not occur under Washington's Mount Vernon. When slaves were beaten, Lee ordered their lacerated flesh to be covered in salty brine. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia enslaved free blacks during the Civil War and he ignored atrocities committed by his troops against black Union soldiers. While the president of Washington College, Lee ignored the abduction and rape of black schoolgirls by a local KKK chapter. When it came to racial equality in politics, Lee wrote that \"the negroes have neither the intelligence nor the other qualifications which are necessary to make them safe depositories of political power.\"\n\nLee oddly tried to claim that the South only held people in slavery because of Christian love. It was because of this perverse type of reasoning that black abolitionist Frederick Douglass wrote this statement.\n\n\"What I have said respecting and against religion, I mean strictly to apply to the slaveholding religion of this land, and with no possible reference to Christianity proper; for, between the Christianity of this land, and the Christianity of Christ, I recognize the widest possible difference -- so wide, that to receive the one as good, pure, and holy, is of necessity to reject the other as bad, corrupt, and wicked. To be the friend of the one, is of necessity to be the enemy of the other. I love the pure, peaceable, and impartial Christianity of Christ: I therefore hate the corrupt, slaveholding, women-whipping, cradle-plundering, partial and hypocritical Christianity of this land. Indeed, I can see no reason, but the most deceitful one, for calling the religion of this land Christianity. I look upon it as the climax of all misnomers, the boldest of all frauds, and the grossest of all libels.\"\n\nLikewise, it could be argued that white supremacists of today take on the veneer of Christianity, yet their words do not espouse Christ's love of all men -- even your enemies -- and the command to forgive.\n\nMere days after Charlottesville, Virginia, erupted into violence, Newsweek says the direct descendant of the Confederate general said, \"There's no place for that. There's no place for that hate.\" The family also believes that moving the Confederate monuments to museums \"makes good sense.\"\n\nIn fact, based on General Lee's own words, it's possible he would never have wanted the Confederate monuments built in the first place. When Lee was asked about the proposed Gettysburg memorial, he wrote that he thought it \"wiser [to] not to keep open the sores of war but to follow the examples of those nations who endeavored to obliterate the marks of civil strife, to commit to oblivion the feelings engendered.\"\n\nWhen it came to the Stonewall Jackson monument, he wrote that such Confederate monuments would only hurt the South, yet he felt that marking the graves of fallen soldiers was appropriate.\n\n\"As regards the erection of such a monument as is contemplated; my conviction is, that however grateful it would be to the feelings of the South, the attempt in the present condition of the Country, would have the effect of retarding, instead of accelerating its accomplishment; and of continuing, if not adding to, the difficulties under which the Southern people labour. All I think that can now be done, is to aid our noble and generous women in their efforts to protect the graves and mark the last resting places of those who have fallen, and wait for better times.\"\n\nRegardless, in modern times, well-intentioned Americans believe that the past should be remembered in full rather than removed from public view. Byron Thomas is a black South Carolinian who flies the Confederate flag to honor his ancestors and because \"the flag celebrates my heritage and regional pride.\" Karen Cooper is an African American Virginia Flagger who rejects the belief that the Confederate flag is inherently a symbol of racism and hate.\n\n\"I actually think that it represents freedom,\" she said in an online video. \"It represents a people who stood up to tyranny.\"\n\nSo, if the Confederate monuments were to remain, how could the statues come to represent unity and an end to racism and hate?\n\nOh, and the 90th PA \"Granite Tree.\" I kind of like the James Longstreet equestrian too. pic.twitter.com/c38ELuvKyS\n\n-- CovfefeWaltrWeathrmn (@And_Thats_Why_) August 17, 2017\n\nHundreds of Confederate monuments are spread across the United States, not just in the South. Some want them torn down. Others would prefer a replacement. But who would best represent the face of reconciliation and peace that the modern world needs?\n\nGeneral Lee is popular today in the American South, but few remember General James \"Pete\" Longstreet. Before becoming a lieutenant general in the Confederate Army known as \"Lee's Old War Horse,\" Longstreet attended West Point as part of a class that included the future Civil War generals Ulysses S. Grant and George Pickett. Longstreet oversaw various Confederate victories, but he's mostly remembered for his controversial defeat at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863 because some believe he was deliberately slow to attack. Longstreet blamed Lee's maneuvers for the devastating failure, which tarnished his reputation among Southerners loyal to Lee.\n\nHowever, it's Longstreet's life and actions after the Civil War ended that should be remembered today. Longstreet's letters contained a clearly-defined belief that cooperation was the ideal course for the former Confederate states.\n\n\"The ideas that divided political parties before the war - upon the rights of the States -were thoroughly discussed by our wisest statesmen, and eventually appealed to the arbitrament of the sword,\" Longstreet wrote. \"The decision was in favor of the North, so that her construction becomes the law, and should be so accepted.\"\n\nWhile Lee \"raged against Republican efforts to enforce racial equality on the South,\" Longstreet joined the Republican Party of longtime friend Grant and supported Reconstruction policies. Because of such actions, he was \"excluded from Confederate circles -- even military reunions -- through his death in 1904.\" Longstreet settled in New Orleans and his \"his loyalty to the administration [of Grant's Republican Party] eventually earning him federal appointments as postmaster of Gainesville, minister to Turkey, U.S. marshal, and U.S. commissioner of railroads.\"\n\nWhat's unknown is Longstreet's motivations for joining the Confederacy in the first place. Regarding the American Civil War, Longstreet is attributed by others as saying, \"If it wasn't about slavery, then I don't know what else it was about.\" His father owned slaves for the family farm and he grew up with his uncle, Augustus Longstreet, who was well known for supporting slavery as a Methodist minister. It's possible that the younger Longstreet espoused similar views earlier in life, but if so it's obvious he changed his mind. Not only did Longstreet eventually convert to Roman Catholicism, which was unheard of in the Protestant majority South, he also became well known for promoting the civil rights and freedoms of African Americans.\n\n\"It is our duty to abandon ideas that are obsolete and conform to the requirements of law,\" Longstreet wrote.\n\nMore colorized images, this time of Confederates: Robert E. Lee (left); James Longstreet (top right); George Pickett (bottom right). pic.twitter.com/NpKt2I9G41\n\n-- Emerging Civil War (@EmergingCWBlog) July 31, 2017\n\nIn a 1867 letter to the New Orleans Times, he wrote that \"the surrender of the former political relations of the negro\" was one of several \"political questions of the war should have been buried upon the fields that marked their end.\" Not only did Longstreet bury political support for slavery, if he had ever harbored any personal racism he apparently buried those beliefs, as well. By 1875, the Macon Weekly Telegraph wrote that they had \"infinitely more respect for Longstreet\" because he \"fraternizes with negro men on public occasions.\"\n\nThe former Confederate general did not simply talk a good talk, he lived out his principles in action. Despite suffering a grievous wound to his throat and arm during the Civil War, Longstreet was in command of an integrated black police unit in New Orleans. A white supremacist paramilitary group called the White League had begun to riot in the streets. This meant that a former Confederate General led the black police against the white, racist rioters in a battle that killed twenty-six people and wounded many more.\n\nConsidering these facts, it seems odd that while wearing the lenses of modern sensibilities that General Lee is remembered as a folk hero while Longstreet is considered a disgrace. A distinction is not even being made by those protesting Confederate monuments since a memorial to Longstreet's men was vandalized recently in Knoxville, Tennessee.\n\n\"The vandalism of the Fort Sanders UDC monument is troubling for two reasons,\" said Dr. Aaron Astor of Maryville College, according to WVLT. \"First, any defacement of a public memorial is a problem. But second, this particular monument was not really a 'lost cause' veneration monument like some of the others in the news. It was more of a battlefield marker commemorating the men fighting under General James Longstreet at the Battle of Fort Sanders in November 1863. It is a monument to the dead -- like a cemetery marker -- more than a testament to the Confederate cause, as at other sites.\"\n\nThere is a General James Longstreet statue in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania that was built in 1998, but it's been described as \"a smaller-scale statue hidden in the woods that makes him look like a hobbit riding a donkey.\" If there is a nationwide movement to have all of the Confederate monuments changed, perhaps Americans should remember Civil War history by using Longstreet as the standard?", "id": "9790172", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "General James Longstreet Statue Should Replace U.S. Civil War Confederate Monuments To Robert E.

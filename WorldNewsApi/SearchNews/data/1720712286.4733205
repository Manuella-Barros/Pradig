The SNP leader said he would meet the convicted felon if he becomes US President to \"fulfil my duties as First Minister\". But Swinney also added that he is \"no fan\" of Trump and said the American \"has done huge damage to democratic civilised debate. It comes after SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said the former president would be \"welcome\" in Scotland. Trump\u2019s latest White House bid suffered a blow recently after he was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying records in an effort to keep an adult film star quiet about an affair that occurred in the 2000s. Despite the guilty verdict, the Republican is neck and neck in the polls with President Biden in this year\u2019s presidential election. Swinney said on a campaign visit to Paisley: \"I obviously accept the outcome of democratic elections. \"So if the people of the United States decide to elect Donald Trump as their president, and he was to come Scotland, I would of course fulfil my duties as First Minister to engage with him. \"The people of Scotland would expect me to do that to any other democratically elected leader of a country. \"Having said that, I am no fan of Donald Trump and I think Donald Trump has done huge damage to democratic civilised debate. \"So I'd really rather he was not the President of the United States. \"But if he becomes the President of the United States, I've got duties as First Minister that I've got to fulfil and I will fulfil [them] because people would expect me to.\" Trump has extensive business interests in Scotland, including a golf course in Aberdeenshire which opened in 2012. He also owns Turnberry golf course in Ayrshire, which is used for the Open.

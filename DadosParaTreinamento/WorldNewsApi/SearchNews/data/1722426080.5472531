{"id": 243278392, "title": "Mohbad: Court Grants Family Permission To Conduct Second Autopsy", "text": "A court has granted the family of late singer, Mohbad permission to conduct a second autopsy. This decision comes after the family expressed dissatisfaction with the initial autopsy results, which were deemed inconclusive. The Aloba family rejected the results and, on 16 June, urged the Lagos State Government to con-firm the autopsy\u2019s authenticity because of the public\u2019s doubts and conflicting reports. Mohbad\u2019s family appealed to the coroner\u2019s inquest\u2019s presiding magistrate to ensure that an in-dependent toxicology report is submitted to the court before the final report is submitted to the authorities. The coroner\u2019s inquest, whose role is to determine the identity of the deceased, the time, cause, and manner of death, has so far revealed that the first autopsy provided no conclusive cause of death. During a Wednesday hear-ing at a magistrate court in Ikorodu, Mohad\u2019s family and their legal representatives were granted permission for a second autopsy. Subsequently, the family and their legal team confirmed they received the court\u2019s authorisation to proceed with the additional au-topsy. At a press conference, Mohbad\u2019s father, Joseph Alo-ba, expressed gratitude for the court\u2019s decision to allow for a second autopsy. \u201cI appreciate the responses all along to the death of Mohbad. We appreciate the judiciary for this decision. There is a reason for the government to instruct that we exhume Mohbad for them to know the cause of his death,\u201d he said. Mohbad, 27, died on 12 Sep-tember 2023 under controversial circumstances. Almost a year af-ter his death, there appear to be conflicting reports over the cause of his death. After several clamours for jus-tice to ascertain the cause of his death, his body was exhumed on 21 September 2023 for an autop-sy by the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH). The autopsy, which com-menced in September 2023, re-leased on 7 June, failed to deter-mine the cause of death. The inconclusiveness of the autopsy results was attributed to body decomposition and poten-tial reactions to medications he received before his death.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"606\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Mohbad-1.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Mohbad-1.jpg 606w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Mohbad-1-300x198.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px\" /></div>&#160;A court has granted the family of late singer, Mohbad permission to conduct a second autopsy.

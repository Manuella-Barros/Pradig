{"id": 231384344, "title": "Jason Kidd Called Jaylen Brown The Celtics &#8216;Best Player&#8217; And Explained Why", "text": "The Boston Celtics thumped the Dallas Mavericks in Game 1 of the NBA Finals, as Boston reminded everyone why they spent the entire season with the league\u2019s best record. The Celtics caught fire in the first quarter and ran out to a 17-point lead that they never relinquished, eventually cruising to a 107-89 win. While the offense impressed early, with Kristaps Porzingis providing a huge lift off the bench in his return after more than a month out with a calf injury, it was their defense that suffocated the Mavs and led them to the win. Going into Game 2, Dallas has to figure out how to get more out of their offense, as Luka Doncic was the only one that produced much of anything, as Boston seemed happy to let him try to score rather than be a facilitator. The Mavs seemingly face an uphill challenge, and they might need some help from Boston to get this series level going back to Dallas. The good news is, this Celtics squad has been known to have a letdown in Game 2 (they\u2019ve twice lost a Game 2 in this postseason) and Jason Kidd seems to be looking to do his part to create a bit of internal discord on the Boston side. On Saturday, Kidd was asked about the challenge that Jaylen Brown presents in this series, and he promptly explained why he feels Brown is Boston\u2019s best player. \u201cWell, Jaylen\u2019s their best player,\u201d Kidd said, matter of factly. \u201cSo just looking at what he does defensively, he picked up Luka full court. He got to the free throw line. He did everything. And that\u2019s what your best player does. Just understanding, he plays both sides, defense and offense, at a high rate and he\u2019s been doing that the whole playoffs. When you talk about the Eastern Conference [Finals] MVP, and it seems like he\u2019s continued to pick up where he left off. He\u2019s continued to play at a high rate, we\u2019ve just got to be a little bit more physical with him and, again, we\u2019ve got to keep him off the free throw line and out of the paint.\u201d Jayson Tatum is typically regarded as the Celtics best player, with Brown carrying a sizable chip on his shoulder, feeling often overlooked in the discussion of stars in the NBA \u2014 this year he finished 16th in All-NBA voting, missing out on the third-team by one spot. This is on the surface level a compliment from Kidd, but it certainly feels like a calculated play (with some plausible deniability) to see if he can play into the rumblings that there\u2019s at least a hint of jealousy and competition between the two Boston stars. As many in Boston will tell you, that is a creation of people on the outside, and Brown and Tatum don\u2019t just get along professionally but are friends off the court. I don\u2019t anticipate this comment from Kidd suddenly tanking the Celtics and creating a rift between their stars, but I also can\u2019t fault him for at least trying to play some mind games, because the Mavs need to get Boston off of their game a bit in any way they can.", "summary": "<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t<img width=\"1024\" height=\"436\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tatum-brown-top.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=436&amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured\" alt=\"tatum-brown-top\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tatum-brown-top.jpg 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tatum-brown-top.jpg?resize=300,128 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tatum-brown-top.jpg?resize=704,300 704w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tatum-brown-top.jpg?resize=768,327 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 40px), (min-width: 1025px) 1024px, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Getty Image</span></figcaption>\t</figure>\n\tJason Kidd offered a high compliment to Jaylen Brown (while also maybe trying to play some mind games with the Celtics).", "url": "https://uproxx.com/dimemag/jason-kidd-jaylen-brown-celtics-best-player-tatum-video/", "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tatum-brown.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:34:21", "author": "Robby Kalland", "authors": ["Robby Kalland"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.226}

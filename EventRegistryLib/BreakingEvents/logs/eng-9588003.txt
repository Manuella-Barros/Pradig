The music icon had all eyes on her when she went at it with a security guard on the red carpet. Rowland looked visibly upset during the interaction, which has now gone viral. Details of what went down remain unknown. However, fans have wasted no time rallying behind the Destiny's Child alum because she can do no wrong.\n\nRowland attended the Cannes Film Festival on Tuesday. She was there for the premiere of the French-Italian film Marcello Mio. The singer, always one to turn heads with her looks, didn't disappoint at the festival. Rowland stunned in a strapless red gown with ruche detail at the bust that flows into a glorious train. She paired the gorgeous ensemble with pointy silver heels and a bedazzled clutch purse. Her accessories for the event included a diamond choker necklace, matching stacked bracelets, and a statement ring.\n\nIn a video from the event, the Motivation songstress was seen smiling at the crowd while walking up the red carpet stairs. However, her mood changed when a seemingly overzealous female security guard came into her space, stretching her arms to lead Rowland away from onlookers. The entertainer was evidently pissed about the interaction. She waved her finger angrily at the guard while speaking strongly. The guard spoke back which infuriated Rowland even more, but another staffer soon de-escalated the altercation.\n\nThis is the second squabble Beyonc\u00e9's BFF has gotten into this year. Back in February, Rowland made headlines after she reportedly stormed off the set of the Today show. Per Page Six, Rowland walked away because of issues with her assigned dressing room.\n\nAs expected, fans got wind of the interaction and shared their opinions online. Many defended Rowland's outburst, saying she must have had a good reason to lash out. \"Yo@KellyRowland, do we need to pull up? No child of destiny, past, present, or future, will ever be disrespected,\" declared one fan. Another wrote, \"This is an accurate way Cannes security treats folks, especially if you're Black and Kelly Rowland responded the RIGHT way to the disrespect.\"\n\nA third fan expressed, \"I love that a white man had to come put Le Karen in her place for her to listen.\" Others tried to guess what Rowland might have said to the guard. One fan guessed:\n\n\"She said 'don't talk to me like that, DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT.

The incident occurred as Rowland made her way up the stairs ahead of the premiere of the film 'Marcello Mio.'\n\nPhotographed while smiling and waving at the crowd, the 43-year-old singer and actress appeared in high spirits. However, the atmosphere shifted as Rowland neared the entrance of the venue. A female security guard, walking behind Rowland, raised her arm behind the star, seemingly guiding her away from the crowd and photographers towards the venue.\n\nDressed in a black pantsuit, the security guard seemed to speak to Rowland or a male security guard nearby. Whatever was said clearly displeased Rowland, who immediately turned to face the staff member.\n\nIn front of the gathered crowd, Rowland raised her finger and scowled at the guard, who appeared visibly flustered. The cause of the altercation remains unclear.\n\nRowland stunned onlookers in a flowing crimson-red dress with a sweetheart neckline, accessorized with a statement diamond necklace.\n\nThe incident quickly went viral on X (formerly Twitter), prompting reactions from fans and onlookers. User @MediumSizeMeech tweeted: \"It was very clear Kelly Rowland was trying to take photos and they were rushing her. The security guard stepped on her dress, and Kelly tried to correct her nicely. When the guard responded rudely, Kelly said, 'Don't talk to me like that.'\"\n\n@MobzWorld added: \"Do you understand how out of pocket you have to be for Kelly Rowland to have to check you?!

On Tuesday, the blonde-haired Kelly Rowland graced the Cannes Film Festival for the French-Italian film Marcello Mio premiere. However, things quickly got heated on the red carpet as viral videos from the event showed the singer seemingly scolding an assistant. Hours after the exchange, insiders have revealed the reason behind the star's shocking outburst.\n\nOn Tuesday, Kelly Rowland attended the 2024 Cannes Film Festival looking as radiant as ever. The actress dazzled in a busty, handless, red, flowing gown and a blonde bob wig. Like every other movie premiere, Rowland graced the red carpet for some photos. Pictures showed the icon smiling and waving at the crowd while making her way down the red carpet, striking pose after pose for the eager shutterbugs. However, things quickly took a different turn as Rowland made her way up a set of stairs. Videos capturing that moment showed a female security guard walking up to the former The Voice coach.\n\nThe woman, dressed in a black pantsuit, held her arm behind Rowland, seemingly guiding her away from the crowd and into the theater. She then said something which, from all indications, didn't sit right with Rowland. Immediately, the 43-year-old turned to face the female staffer. Rowland scowled as she held up her left pointer finger and appeared to scold the woman in front of everyone. As she spoke back, the female security seemed frazzled, prompting Rowland to continue the outburst while going up the stairs.\n\nHours after the incident, insiders finally gave curious fans the details of what transpired. According to them, Rowland wasn't the instigator in the incident. Speaking to Daily Mail, a source revealed Kelly Rowland's red carpet outburst was because she was tired of dealing with the staff members' aggressiveness.\n\n\"The people who are assigned to helping stars walk the red carpet were being aggressive and Kelly was trying to ignore it,\" the source said. \"By the time she got to the last woman she had had it because she scolded Kelly and told her to move when she was trying to wave to fans and help the paparazzi get their shot,\" they added.\n\nThe insider also explained that Rowland didn't care if she came across like a diva as long as she advocated for herself. \"She isn't fake and wanted to set a clear boundary,\" the source revealed.

would not come as a surprise at all.'\n\nBefore Rowland left the set of the NBC chat series, she was asked by Guthrie: 'What do you think about your friend Beyonc\u00e9?' to which she replied, 'I'm so proud of her.'\n\nGuthrie then veered the discussion toward Beyonc\u00e9's newly-announced foray into country music with her album Act II, asking Rowland, 'Were you surprised and what do you think about it?'\n\nRowland replied, 'I'm so proud of her - so happy for her.'\n\nThe insider told the outlet that Rowland and her team will not agree to an interview that involves questions about Beyonc\u00e9 and Destiny's Child, as 'she wants to leave that behind' and move forward in her career.\n\nThe Wrap reported that the Today show 'does not typically agree to interview topics being off-limits ahead of time,' which could have led to a miscommunication.\n\nAnother source told the outlet that Rowland left because of the shoddy dressing room accommodations.\n\nSeparate sources told TMZ that the issue was not about Beyonce, and the insider insisted that Rowland's exit was due to the show's dressing rooms - described as 'dumpy, glorified closets.'\n\nRowland's staffers were unsuccessful in procuring her a new dressing room, as another one upstairs was occupied by Jennifer Lopez, sources said.\n\nKelly failed to address the real reason for her decision to walk out of The Today Show, insisting in later interviews she was focused on promoting her new movie role.\n\nAhead of her security clash, Kelly had stunned on the red carpet in a red strapless custom Loewe gown with a lengthy train as she posed for snaps at the event.\n\nShowing off her svelte physique, Kelly's dress included a loose bodice that highlighted her ample cleavage.\n\nThe dress flowed into a floor-length skirt with a train that followed Kelly as she made her way along the red carpet.\n\nAdding a touch of glamour to her look, Kelly accessorized with a sparkly diamond necklace and clutch bag.\n\nAhead of her security clash, Kelly had stunned on the red carpet in a red strapless custom Loewe gown with a lengthy train as she posed for snaps at the event", "source": {"uri":

Kelly Was NOT Having It': Fans Race to Kelly Rowland's Defense as Insider Explains Why Singer Scolded a 'French Karen' at Cannes Film Festival", "body": "Kelly Rowland has been a beloved celebrity and media darling since bursting onto the charts in the 1990s. However, in 2024, the Destiny's Child singer has faced a wave of press portraying her as a demanding diva obsessed with maintaining her star status.\n\nA recent incident on the red carpet of the \"Marcello Mio\" premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on Tuesday, May 21, did little to counter this narrative.\n\nWearing a floor-length flowing red gown, the newly blond Rowland was ascending the stairs to the screening venue as handlers busied themselves around her. Cameras at the event on the French Riviera captured her radiant smile as she kept stopping to wave at the throng of paparazzi and fans. The scene then deteriorated into her wagging her finger and frowning at a white woman in a black suit, who seemingly was one of the security guards ushering the celebrities up the stairs and into the venue.\n\nPictures posted by Page Six make the singer look like an \"angry Black woman,\" but fans who posted the full video say there is context to her read and a reason why her perfectly manicured finger was pointed in the woman's face.\n\nThe guard holds up her arm up behind the Grammy Award winner, almost seeming to brush her back. In the video, it appears the security guard might have stepped on Rowland's dress. The singer turns back, says something to security with a smile on her face, and then words are exchanged as the security guard continues to motion the star forward. Within seconds, the Houston native, who did not want to be touched, went off on her.\n\nAn Insider tells Page Six that the reason Kelly became snappy was because \"The people who are assigned to helping stars walk the red carpet were being aggressive and Kelly was trying to ignore it.\"\n\nThe insider went on to say, \"By the time [Rowland] got to the last woman, she had had it because she scolded Kelly and told her to move when she was trying to wave to fans and help the paparazzi get their shot.\"\n\nEagle-eyed fans attempted to read the singer's lips, where, to some, it appeared she was saying, \"Don't talk to me like that! Don't talk to me like that! You're not my mother; do not talk to me like that!\"\n\n\"That security guard had no idea who she was rushing off the red carpet. The disrespect... Kelly was NOT having it,\" one person tweeted. Someone else said, \"They better not try to pin the 'Angry Black Woman' title on Ms. Kelly girl WE WILL NOT STAND FOR IT!\"\n\nAnother posted with a GIF, \"I wish people stop playing with Kelly! She is not that shy, timid teen that you trashy people use to walk all over anymore! She's a mother! If she can't stand up for herself, how can she protect her kids? I'm with Kelly!! Proud of you, Kween.\"\n\nAn X user tweeted, \"Omg French Karen had Kelly Rowland all the way f -- ked up at Cannes.\"\n\nShortly after the exchange, another person comes over and tells the guard to leave the \"Dilemma\" artist alone, but by that time, Kelendria Trene had already come all the way out.\n\nEven actress Jack\u00e9e Harry knew Kelly was not to be messed with. She posted a photo of the singer's now-viral finger wag with the caption, \"If I send this to you, you are not my momma so don't talk to me like that.\"\n\nHer true fans understood what they saw as the game being played in the media and came to her defense.\n\nOne wrote, \"I have no idea what happened, but I don't like the way Kelly Rowland is being portrayed as 'popping off' and 'furiously scolding' a security guard. With zero details, they are painting Kelly as the aggressor and bringing up the dressing room issue with Hoda Kotb.\"\n\nThe incident at the Cannes Film Festival marks another chapter in the increasingly contentious public narrative surrounding Rowland.\n\nJust three months ago, the \"Say My Name\" singer abruptly left the \"Today\" show set, citing her dressing room as \"not up to par.\" Her rushed departure made gossip sites quickly, noting that at the last minute, the star left Hoda Kotb scrambling for a replacement co-host for that hour.\n\nRowland insists that her leaving had nothing to do with the host and expressed her love for Kotb despite leaving the show, but that didn't stop certain people from calling her a diva.", "source": {"uri": "atlantablackstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Atlanta Black Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nicole_duncan_smith@atlantablackstar.com", "name": "Nicole Duncan-Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Rowland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Rowland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paparazzi", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paparazzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny's_Child", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Destiny's Child"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Riviera", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Riviera"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannes Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diva", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Say_My_Name", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Say My Name"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack\u00e9e_Harry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack\u00e9e Harry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilemma_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dilemma (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoda_Kotb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hoda Kotb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cannes"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cannes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film_Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film Festivals", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories_and_Patches", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories and Patches", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Criminals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Criminals", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2154012982.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588003", "eventUri": "eng-9588003", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 363, "textEnd": 369}], "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

that Kelly was not aggressively asked about Beyonce, and adamantly denied The Wrap's claims.\n\nThe Wrap insider said that the dressing room accommodations had nothing to do with Rowland's exit.\n\n'The story was spun that Kelly didn't like her dressing room, but she has been on the Today show numerous times, she and her team know the dressing room set up,' the insider said.\n\n'That would not come as a surprise at all.'\n\nBefore Rowland left the set of the NBC chat series, she was asked by Guthrie: 'What do you think about your friend Beyonc\u00e9?' to which she replied, 'I'm so proud of her.'\n\nGuthrie then veered the discussion toward Beyonc\u00e9's newly-announced foray into country music with her album Act II, asking Rowland, 'Were you surprised and what do you think about it?'\n\nRowland replied, 'I'm so proud of her - so happy for her.'\n\nThe insider told the outlet that Rowland and her team will not agree to an interview that involves questions about Beyonc\u00e9 and Destiny's Child, as 'she wants to leave that behind' and move forward in her career.\n\nThe Wrap reported that the Today show 'does not typically agree to interview topics being off-limits ahead of time,' which could have led to a miscommunication.\n\nAnother source told the outlet that Rowland left because of the shoddy dressing room accommodations.\n\nSeparate sources told TMZ that the issue was not about Beyonce, and the insider insisted that Rowland's exit was due to the show's dressing rooms - described as 'dumpy, glorified closets.'\n\nRowland's staffers were unsuccessful in procuring her a new dressing room, as another one upstairs was occupied by Jennifer Lopez, sources said.\n\nKelly failed to address the real reason for her decision to walk out of The

"Kelly Rowland's heated security exchange", "body": "Kelly Rowland has been snapped in a heated moment at the Cannes Film Festival, with pictures showing the singer seemingly scolding a security guard while walking the red carpet on Tuesday.\n\nThe Destiny's Child alum, 43, attended the event to watch the premiere of French film Marcello Mio, featuring Chiara Mastroianni.\n\nHowever, as Rowland walked into the venue, video footage showed her in a verbal argument with a member of security, who raised her arm as a way to guide the singer into the screening, reports Daily Mail.\n\nThe Dilemma hitmaker could be seen angrily pointing a finger at the security guard and appeared to scold her in front of the crowd of photographers.\n\nThe security guard appeared panicked as she responded to Rowland, who proceeded up the steps and then turned back again to continue her rant.\n\nWhile it is unknown what caused the dispute, Daily Mail has contacted Rowland's representative for comment.\n\nRowland's heated moment on the Cannes steps comes just a few weeks after she stormed out of the Today Show.\n\nWhile speculation has spiralled regarding her reason for walking out, one of the rumours suggests that Rowland was dissatisfied with her dressing room, thus forcing Rita Ora to step in at the last minute.\n\nHowever, insiders allege that Rowland stormed off the show due to the \"disrespect\" shown to her by Today Show co-host Savannah Guthrie, who \"aggressively\" asked the singer about Beyonce instead of basing her questions around Rowland's latest film, Mea Culpa, which she had appeared on the talk show to promote.\n\nThe dressing room rumour appeared to be confirmed by fellow Today Show co-host Hoda Kotb, who offered to share her dressing room with Rowland the next time she came on the show.\n\nBut Kotb's comments seemingly made things worse, as a source told The Wrap that Rowland left after she \"felt disrespected' following Guthrie's bombardment of questions about her former bandmate.\n\n\"Kelly was offended that Savannah repeatedly and aggressively asked her about Beyonce\" the source told the publication.\n\nThe insider went on to say that the dressing room speculation was far from the truth, saying: \"The story was spun that Kelly didn't like her dressing room, but she has been on the Today Show numerous times, she and her team know the dressing room set up.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Rowland", "type": "person",

that Kelly was not aggressively asked about Beyonce, and adamantly denied The Wrap's claims.\n\nThe Wrap insider said that the dressing room accommodations had nothing to do with Rowland's exit.\n\n'The story was spun that Kelly didn't like her dressing room, but she has been on the Today show numerous times, she and her team know the dressing room set up,' the insider said.\n\n'That would not come as a surprise at all.'\n\nBefore Rowland left the set of the NBC chat series, she was asked by Guthrie: 'What do you think about your friend Beyonc\u00e9?' to which she replied, 'I'm so proud of her.'\n\nGuthrie then veered the discussion toward Beyonc\u00e9's newly-announced foray into country music with her album Act II, asking Rowland, 'Were you surprised and what do you think about it?'\n\nRowland replied, 'I'm so proud of her - so happy for her.'\n\nThe insider told the outlet that Rowland and her team will not agree to an interview that involves questions about Beyonc\u00e9 and Destiny's Child, as 'she wants to leave that behind' and move forward in her career.\n\nThe Wrap reported that the Today show 'does not typically agree to interview topics being off-limits ahead of time,' which could have led to a miscommunication.\n\nAnother source told the outlet that Rowland left because of the shoddy dressing room accommodations.\n\nSeparate sources told TMZ that the issue was not about Beyonce, and the insider insisted that Rowland's exit was due to the show's dressing rooms - described as 'dumpy, glorified closets.'\n\nRowland's staffers were unsuccessful in procuring her a new dressing room, as another one upstairs was occupied by Jennifer Lopez, sources said.\n\nKelly failed to address the real reason for her decision to walk out of The Today Show, insisting in later interviews she was focused on promoting her new movie role.\n\nAhead of her security clash, Kelly had stunned on the red carpet in a red strapless custom Loewe gown with a lengthy train as she posed for snaps at the event.\n\nShowing off her svelte physique, Kelly's dress included a loose bodice that highlighted her ample cleavage.\n\nThe dress flowed into a

The incident occurred during the premiere of the French-Italian comedy Marcello Mio, where Rowland was momentarily halted by a security guard, leading to a brief exchange.\n\nWhile posing for photographers, Rowland was interrupted by the guard who signaled her to ascend the stairs. A video captured at the event shows Rowland engaging in a conversation with the guard, which escalated to the point where the singer pointed a finger in the guard's face. The security personnel seemed taken aback and conversed with Rowland's team members following the interaction.\n\nThis is not the first time this year that Rowland has been involved in a dispute with event staff. Earlier in February, she reportedly left the set of the Today show due to dissatisfaction with her dressing room conditions. Despite the incident, Rowland expressed her affection for the show and co-anchor Hoda Kotb when prompted for comments on WGN News.\n\nDespite the confrontations, Kelly Rowland continues to handle such situations with the poise and grace that her fans have come to admire. As a prominent figure in the entertainment industry, her actions on and off the stage remain a topic of interest for her audience.\n\nAs Rowland navigates the complexities of the spotlight, her experiences at high-profile events like Cannes serve as a reminder of the scrutiny and challenges faced by celebrities in the public eye.", "source": {"uri": "rollingout.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Out"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Rowland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Rowland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny's_Child", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Destiny's Child"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannes Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(American_TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Today (American TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGN-TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WGN-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoda_Kotb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hoda Kotb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cannes"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cannes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film_Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film Festivals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/shutterstock_1604341357-1-scaled-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588003", "eventUri": "eng-9588003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The singer, 43, had been attending the premiere of the French film Marcello Mio, and looked stunning in a busty red flowing gown. As Kelly made her way up the famous steps, she appeared to engage in a verbal dispute with a member of security after she held up her arm to guide her into the venue.\n\nHowever, it has been revealed that the tiff came about because staff members at the iconic French festival were 'being aggressive' and Kelly had 'had it' with them. 'The people who are assigned to helping stars walk the red carpet were being aggressive and Kelly was trying to ignore it,' an insider told DailyMail.com. 'By the time she got to the last woman she had had it because she scolded Kelly and told her to move when she was trying to wave to fans and help the paparazzi get their shot,' they added.\n\nThe source also revealed: 'She doesn't care if she comes across like a diva if she knows that she is advocating for herself. She isn't fake and wanted to set a clear boundary.' Footage from the altercation shows a furious Kelly visibly scolding the staff member as she held up her finger to admonish the woman in front of the crowd in attendance. The security guard appeared to frantically respond to Kelly, who even turned back to continue her tirade as she made her way up the rest of the steps.\n\nKelly's reaction comes just weeks after the star walked out of an appearance on the Today show in February, though the reason for this has been disputed. It had been claimed that Kelly skipped out on co-hosting the rest of the Today show alongside anchor Hoda Kotb because she was dissatisfied with her dressing room, forcing Rita Ora to step in at the last minute. However sources have since claimed that Kelly had actually walked off the show due to 'disrespect' shown to her by Hoda's co-host Savannah Guthrie who 'aggressively' questioned her about Beyonc\u00e9 - rather than ask the singer about what she was there to promote - her new film Mea Culpa.\n\nThe dressing room excuse was also even seemingly confirmed by Hoda herself, when she offered Rowland to share her dressing next time she comes on the show. However, it appears Hoda's comments stirred the pot even further, as an insider told The Wrap that Kelly left after she 'felt disrespected' after Guthrie asked her a series of questions about her friend and former bandmate Beyonc\u00e9. 'Kelly was offended that Savannah repeatedly and aggressively asked her about Beyonc\u00e9,' the insider told the outlet. 'Kelly was upset about Savannah's aggressive questioning about Beyonc\u00e9. She and her team were not happy and felt disrespected.'\n\nA source told TMZ soon after, however, that Kelly was not aggressively asked about Beyonce, and adamantly denied The Wrap's claims. The Wrap insider said that the dressing room accommodations had nothing to do with Rowland's exit. 'The story was spun that Kelly didn't like her dressing room, but she has been on the Today show numerous times, she and her team know the dressing room set up,' the insider said. 'That would not come as a surprise at all.'\n\nBefore Rowland left the set of the NBC chat series, she was asked by Guthrie: 'What do you think about your friend Beyonc\u00e9?' to which she replied, 'I'm so proud of her.' Guthrie then veered the discussion toward Beyonc\u00e9's newly-announced foray into country music with her album Act II, asking Rowland, 'Were you surprised and what do you think about it?' Rowland replied, 'I'm so proud of her - so happy for her.' The insider told the outlet that Rowland and her team will not agree to an interview that involves questions about Beyonc\u00e9 and Destiny's Child, as 'she wants to leave that behind' and move forward in her career.\n\nThe Wrap reported that the Today show 'does not typically agree to interview topics being off-limits ahead of time,' which could have led to a miscommunication. Another source told the outlet that Rowland left because of the shoddy dressing room accommodations. Separate sources told TMZ that the issue was not about Beyonce, and the insider insisted that Rowland's exit was due to the show's dressing rooms - described as 'dumpy, glorified closets.'\n\nRowland's staffers were unsuccessful in procuring her a new dressing room, as another one upstairs was occupied by Jennifer Lopez, sources said. Kelly failed to address the real reason for her decision to walk out of The Today Show, insisting in later interviews she was focused on promoting her new movie role.\n\nAhead of her security clash, Kelly had stunned on the red carpet in a red strapless custom Loewe gown with a lengthy train as she posed for snaps at the event. Showing off her svelte physique, Kelly's dress included a loose bodice that highlighted her ample cleavage. The dress flowed into a floor-length skirt with a train that followed Kelly as she made her way along the red carpet. Adding a touch of glamour to her look, Kelly accessorized with a sparkly diamond necklace and clutch bag.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Rowland scolded the staff, reportedly frustrated by their seemingly aggressive behavior.\n\nThis incident comes a few months after Rowland left the \"Today\" show, allegedly because she was dissatisfied with the dressing room she was given.\n\nInsiders have unveiled the backstory behind Rowland's confrontation with an assistant on the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival. A source who spoke to the DailyMail revealed that a verbal altercation ensued between Rowland and a security member, triggered by the purportedly \"aggressive\" behavior of festival staff as she made her way up the Cannes Film Festival steps for the premiere of the French film \"Marcello Mio.\"\n\nAccording to the source, the 43-year-old singer reached her breaking point when the people \"assigned to helping stars walk the red carpet were being aggressive, and Kelly was trying to ignore it.\"\n\n\"By the time she got to the last woman she had had it because she scolded Kelly and told her to move when she was trying to wave to fans and help the paparazzi get their shot,\" the source continued. She doesn't care if she comes across like a diva if she knows that she is advocating for herself. She isn't fake and wanted to set a clear boundary.\"\n\nVideo footage captured the intense moment Rowland vehemently scolded the staff member, raising her finger in admonition. As the security guard seemed to react urgently to her rebuke, the singer persisted in her tirade even as she ascended the remaining steps.\n\nRowland's reaction comes a few months after the star abruptly left an appearance on the \"Today\" show in February, though the reason for her departure has been subject to debate.\n\nAccording to sources from Page Six, Rowland's departure from NBC's \"Today\" show was prompted by her dissatisfaction with her dressing room.\n\nThe R&B singer and actress appeared on the 8 a.m. segment of \"Today\" and was slated to guest host the fourth hour with Kotb. However, the former Destiny's Child singer withdrew at the last minute, allegedly because the dressing room was too small.\n\nHer abrupt exit left Kotb scrambling to find a replacement, with Rita Ora stepping in at the last minute.\n\n\"Kelly and her team were not happy. They did not like the dressing room, so they decided to pull her off the show, leaving [Kotb] without a guest host for the 10 a.m. hour,\" a source told the news outlet. This reasoning was seemingly confirmed by Kotb's offer for Rowland to share her dressing room in the future.\n\nAccording to The Wrap, an insider revealed that Rowland's departure was prompted by perceived \"disrespect\" from Kotb's co-host, Savannah Guthrie. The source claimed that the \"Dilemma\" singer \"felt disrespected\" due to Guthrie's persistent questioning about Beyonc\u00e9.\n\n\"Kelly was offended that Savannah repeatedly and aggressively asked her about Beyonc\u00e9, rather than focusing on the promotion of Rowland's new film, \"Mea Culpa,\" the insider shared. \"She and her team were not happy and felt disrespected.\"\n\n\"The story was spun that Kelly didn't like her dressing room, but she has been on the Today show numerous times, and she and her team know the dressing room set up,\" the insider clarified. \"That would not come as a surprise at all.\"\n\nBefore leaving the NBC set, Guthrie asked Rowland about Beyonc\u00e9's venture into country music. Rowland responded with praise for her friend, stating, \"I'm so proud of her -- so happy for her.\"\n\nHowever, TMZ later contradicted The Wrap's claims, asserting that Rowland was not aggressively questioned about Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nDespite the conflicting reports, Rowland refrained from addressing the true reason for her departure from the \"Today\" show and focused instead on promoting her Netflix movie, \"Mea Culpa.\"\n\nThe film was produced by Tyler Perry and starred Rowland, who also served as a producer in subsequent interviews.\n\nSince the movie's release, critics have been unmerciful in their assessment of Mea Culpa, which is reflected in its dismal score of only 17 percent on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nThis score indicates that fewer than one-fifth of the critics who viewed the film offered a positive review.\n\nIn a scathing two-star review for The Guardian, critic Benjamin Lee lamented, \"As one might have guessed from the plot description, it's hopelessly overstacked, Perry's poor actors stumbling over absurdly soapy dialogue, needlessly busying something that required a lot more focus to work.\"\n\nLee criticized the film's trajectory, noting, \"While it might start out as an erotic thriller, it slows down to a damp relationship drama before meandering its way to a climax hinged on head-scratching twists that make little to zero sense.\"", "source": {"uri":

Literally one of the sweetest people in the world, but don't get it twisted. What y'all think she said?

Don't talk to me like that. Oh wowww'; 'It looks like the security lady stepped on her dress, too. Initially, Kelly put her hand on her shoulder as if to say 'it's okay' but that security guard must have said something back she didn't like.

Don't talk to me like that. You're not my momma. I told you not to talk to me like that.'\n\nAnother mused: 'It was very clear Kelly Rowland was trying to take photos and they were rushing her then that security guard stepped on her dress and Kelly tried to correct her nicely and the security guard decided to be rude and Kelly said \"Don't talk to me like that.\"'\n\n'Lip readers are saying Kelly Rowland told female security \"don't talk to me like that, I'm not a child\", while pointing her finger at her after stepping on her dress at Cannes Festival in France,' one person commented.\n\n'The security ruined Kelly Rowland's moment to shine,' another wrote.\n\n'Kelly said: Don't talk to me like that,' one suggested, as someone else chimed in: 'Many native English speakers read this on their lips: \"don't talk to me like that you're not my mother\" and they repeat this with emphasis. It seems like security rushed her and ended up being rude or something,' read one tweet about the incident.\n\n'The full video of Kelly Rowland fighting in Cannes. Apparently the security guards were rushing her, but in a very incisive way, you know, even rude. And the woman touched her, and if there's one thing that makes Americans happy, it's when you touch them for no reason,' another commented.\n\nOthers went on: 'Do you understand how out of pocket you have to be for Kelly Rowland to have to check you? Literally one of the sweetest people in the world, but don't get it twisted. What y'all think she said? I think she said 'don't talk to me like that, I'm not a child';\n\n'Looks like you said, don't talk to me like that you're not my mother. Don't talk to me like that. Oh wowww';\n\n'It looks like the security lady stepped on her dress, too. Initially, Kelly put her hand on her shoulder as if to say \"it's okay\" but that security guard must have said something back she didn't like. Even the lady Kelly was with was p****d'.\n\nIt comes as insiders revealed the reason why Kelly kicked off on the carpet and claimed that she 'doesn't care' if she comes across as a diva.\n\nIt was claimed that the tiff came about because staff members were 'being aggressive' and Kelly had 'had it' with them.\n\n'The people who are assigned to helping stars walk the red carpet were being aggressive and Kelly was trying to ignore it,' an insider told DailyMail.com.\n\n'By the time she got to the last woman she had had it because she scolded Kelly and told her to move when she was trying to wave to fans and help the paparazzi get their shot,' they added.\n\nThe source also revealed: 'She doesn't care if she comes across like a diva if she knows that she is advocating for herself. She isn't fake and wanted to set a clear boundary.\n\nThe singer had been attending the premiere of the French film Marcello Mio, and looked stunning in a busty red flowing gown\n\nKelly's reaction comes just weeks after the star walked out of an appearance on the Today show in February, though the reason for this has been disputed.\n\nIt had been claimed that Kelly skipped out on co-hosting the rest of the Today show alongside anchor Hoda Kotb because she was dissatisfied with her dressing room, forcing Rita Ora to step in at the last minute.\n\nHowever sources have since claimed that Kelly had actually walked off the show due to 'disrespect' shown to her by Hoda's co-host Savannah Guthrie who 'aggressively' questioned her about Beyonc\u00e9 - rather than ask the singer about what she was there to promote - her new film Mea Culpa.\n\nThe dressing room excuse was also even seemingly confirmed by Hoda herself, when she offered Rowland to share her dressing next time she comes on the show.\n\nHowever, it appears Hoda's comments stirred the pot even further, as an insider told The Wrap that Kelly left after she 'felt disrespected' after Guthrie asked her a series of questions about her friend and former bandmate Beyonc\u00e9.\n\n'Kelly was offended that Savannah repeatedly and aggressively asked her about Beyonc\u00e9,' the insider told the outlet.\n\n'Kelly was upset about Savannah's aggressive questioning about Beyonc\u00e9.

The guard could then be seen laughing to colleagues.\n\nIt is unclear what caused the dispute. The Independent has contacted a representative for Rowland for comment.\n\nFans came to Rowland's defence as they felt that the guard had been disrespectful to the singer by standing on her dress and attempting to \"rush\" her up the stairs.\n\n\"She was laughing in Kelly's face when she politely told her she'd stepped on her dress,\" speculated one person as the footage circulated on X/Twitter.\n\n\"I like to support workers at events like this but that 'security' should be fired... especially for visibly laughing to others at the end after continuously disrespecting that lady?\" added another, while others called the guard a \"French Karen\".\n\n\"Kelly Rowland had to gather security after they tried to rush her up the stairs while she attempted to talk to fans and paparazzi,\" defended another.\n\nOthers pointed out that the guard had been in the singer's personal space.\n\n\"Why she keep trying to touch Kelly too ugh GET BACK,\" said one frustrated fan, while another joked: \"Still till this day the female security hand is still out.\"\n\nIt comes weeks after Rowland dropped out of a co-hosting appearance on NBC's Today with Hoda & Jenna.\n\nAfter the \"Stole\" singer's brief appearance during the network's 8am morning broadcast to promote her new Netflix movie, Mea Culpa, Rowland was scheduled to co-host NBC's 10th-hour show with Kotb.\n\nHowever, according to Page Six, sources said that Rowland and her team \"did not like the dressing room, so they decided to pull her off the show, leaving [Kotb] without a guest host for the 10am hour\".\n\nKotb has addressed the alleged incident on air as she said \"I just want to say this: I have great love and admiration for Kelly Rowland. I adore her, and I want her to come back on our show, and I want her to host again.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Rowland", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Rowland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation_(Kelly_Rowland_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motivation (Kelly Rowland song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/77th_Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "77th Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny's_Child", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Destiny's Child"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannes Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_with_Hoda_&_Jenna", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Today with Hoda & Jenna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(American_TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Today (American TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paparazzi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paparazzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/22/09/SEI205406862.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588003", "eventUri": "eng-9588003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

I guess they were made for standing on. Silly me.\"\n\nUser Honest T probably expressed what most people were thinking when he wrote, \"Security is just trying to do her job and @KELLYROWLAND decides to treat her like crap. Typical. Just let these divas like her attend the event with no security and fend for themselves.\"\n\nSome on social media platform X tried excusing her behavior, saying, \"Do you understand how out of pocket you have to be for Kelly Rowland to have to check you?! Literally, one of the sweetest people in the world, but don't get it twisted.\"\n\n\"Insiders\" (most likely, Rowland's own PR team) told the Daily Mail that the \"people who are assigned to helping stars walk the red carpet were being aggressive and Kelly was trying to ignore it. By the time she got to the last woman she had had it because she scolded Kelly and told her to move when she was trying to wave to fans and help the paparazzi get their shot.\"\n\nFinally, these \"insiders\" wrapped up their defense of Rowland with this gem: \"She doesn't care if she comes across like a diva if she knows that she is advocating for herself. She isn't fake and wanted to set a clear boundary.\"\n\nClearly.\n\nAnd, pray tell, what would the real difference be between \"advocating for yourself\" and \"treating people beneath you like dirt\"?\n\nBecause, based on Rowland's recent behavior, there doesn't seem to be much of a difference.\n\nAs Page Six reported back in February, Rowland walked out of an appearance on the Today Show, giving various reasons, such as her dressing room being inadequate for her needs, or, as the Daily Mail noted, getting irritated with co-host Savannah Guthrie for asking her about former bandmate Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nRegardless of the real reasons for Rowland's outburst, she seems to have a pattern of this kind of diva behavior, and apparently thought she was above the woman she berated at Cannes.\n\nEven the \"insider\" comments were quite telling, betraying both Rowland's entitlement and sense of self-importance, in \"advocating for herself\" and having no fear of seeming like a \"diva.\"\n\nSome might find this defense compelling, but in reality, it was the kind of excuse that would play best in a society that has become wholly self-centered, despite its great moral decay.\n\nRowland cared nothing for the security woman at Cannes. She appeared only to care that her own desires were thwarted by a mere underling.\n\nNo matter what happened, this was no way for Rowland, or anyone, to treat someone.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "allison_anton@westernjournal.com", "name": "Allison Anton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Rowland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Rowland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diva", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny's_Child", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Destiny's Child"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannes Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(American_TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Today (American TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah_Guthrie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Savannah Guthrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paparazzi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paparazzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cannes"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cannes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.westernjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rowland-at-Cannes.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588003", "eventUri": "eng-9588003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

adamantly denied claims that this caused her Today Show walk-out\n\nA source told TMZ soon after, however, that Kelly was not aggressively asked about Beyonce, and adamantly denied The Wrap's claims.\n\nThe Wrap insider said that the dressing room accommodations had nothing to do with Rowland's exit.\n\n'The story was spun that Kelly didn't like her dressing room, but she has been on the Today show numerous times, she and her team know the dressing room set up,' the insider said.\n\n'That would not come as a surprise at all.'\n\nBefore Rowland left the set of the NBC chat series, she was asked by Guthrie: 'What do you think about your friend Beyonc\u00e9?' to which she replied, 'I'm so proud of her.'\n\nGuthrie then veered the discussion toward Beyonc\u00e9's newly-announced foray into country music with her album Act II, asking Rowland, 'Were you surprised and what do you think about it?'\n\nRowland replied, 'I'm so proud of her - so happy for her.'\n\nThe insider told the outlet that Rowland and her team will not agree to an interview that involves questions about Beyonc\u00e9 and Destiny's Child, as 'she wants to leave that behind' and move forward in her career.\n\nThe Wrap reported that the Today show 'does not typically agree to interview topics being off-limits ahead of time,' which could have led to a miscommunication.\n\nAnother source told the outlet that Rowland left because of the shoddy dressing room accommodations.\n\nSeparate sources told TMZ that the issue was not about Beyonce, and the insider insisted that Rowland's exit was due to the show's dressing rooms - described as 'dumpy, glorified closets.'\n\nRowland's staffers were unsuccessful in procuring her a new dressing room, as another one upstairs was occupied by Jennifer Lopez, sources said.\n\nKelly failed to address the real reason for her decision to walk out of The Today Show, insisting in later interviews she was focused on promoting her new movie role.\n\nAhead

We are not alone.\n\nSeveral phone and video captures showing the alleged incident, where a red carpet handler appeared to disrespect Kelly Rowland, have gone viral. This incident, which occurred at the 77th annual Cannes Film Festival on May 21, has sparked some outrage and overwhelming support for the music, fashion, and entertainment icon.\n\nWe do not play about our good Sis!\n\nRELATED: Kelly Rowland Is The Definition Of Fashion Forward At The Launch Of The Streaming App ;Vinivia'\n\nKelly Rowland dazzles in Cannes in red.\n\nIn the viral clips, Kelly arrives on the Marcello Mio red carpet with a flurry of activities around her. It goes without saying that the Mea Culpa star and producer shut it down.\n\nThe known fashionista and red carpet slayer wore a dazzling red sleeveless draped gown from Anamika Khanna. Her hair was bobbin in the platinum blonde cut that has become her signature style of late.\n\nSource: Daniele Venturelli / Getty\n\nKelly politely checks a red carpet handler - and keeps slaying.\n\nAs Kelly heads up red carpet-covered stairs, poses with media, and waves at fans, videos show event handlers motioning and speaking to the starlet. One handler repeatedly seems to wave Kelly to move and rush her as she works the media.\n\nAs she continues walking, another handler appears to step on the Texas girl's dress and urge Kelly to move along as well. The songstress then appears to respond sharply (inaudibly), visibly unnerved by the situation.\n\nThe \"Motivation\" singer has not spoken publicly about the encounter.\n\nBut the truth is, she doesn't have to.\n\nWe are #TeamKellyRowland - all day.\n\nThis incident - while possibly unique to the Cannes Festival and Kelly - is not isolated. Black women frequently face microaggressions and outright disrespect in various public and professional settings.\n\nDespite our immense contributions and achievements, Black women often struggle for the recognition and respect we deserve. And when we push for it, we're called \"too much,\" \"angry,\" or some word with a similar negative connotation.\n\nNo matter what happened between the parties in the video on the beautiful shores of France, we are Team Kelendria all day. We applaud her polite raise of the finger and verbal check on the carpet.\n\nRight after speaking to the handlers, the \"Destiny's Child\" member flipped her hair, smiled, and kept slaying on the way to her event. The epitome of style, grace, and excellence, Kelly kept moving as all queens should.\n\nSee the video below.\n\nRELATED\n\nKelly Rowland Rocks A Janet Jackson-Inspired Look To The CAA Pre-Oscar Soiree\n\nThat Part!

It appears that she got into an altercation with a security guard who was trying to usher her up the grand staircase at the Palais.\n\nThe former Destiny's Child star looked gorgeous with a vivid red gown that hugged her gorgeous curves. She paired it with a stunning diamond choker and drop earrings for extra sparkle -- she looked incredible! Understandably, she wanted her moment on one of the fanciest red carpets of the year, but the festival is also known for running a tight ship, which means that the screenings start on time. Things seemed to get heated when a female usher put her hand behind the 43-year-old star's back, trying to guide her up the stairs.\n\nIt worked initially, but when the guard kept putting her arm up, without touching Rowland, but the actress seemed frustrated by the consistent reminder to keep moving. (And the arm motion was pretty aggressive from the video seen HERE.) The Daily Mail's lip-reading expert, Jacqui Press, claimed that Rowland snapped at the usher and pointed her finger, \"Don't talk to me like that.\" The row seemed to escalate as a male usher stepped in and Rowland doubled down with, \"You still don't talk to me like that.\"\n\nRowland hasn't commented publicly about the incident, but the unsettling moment is reminding fans of her last-minute walkout on the set of the Today show. She was supposed to co-host the fourth hour of Today With Hoda & Jenna, but she exited over issues she had with the show. One theory was that she didn't like the available dressing room to get ready because it didn't fit her entire glam squad. The other reason, shared by The Wrap, was that Rowland is tired of answering questions about Beyonc\u00e9 -- it was supposed to be a strictly off-limit topic that Savannah Guthrie ignored.\n\nSo, it seems like Rowland is being misunderstood, and her fans have got her back. \"The fact that thee Kelly Rowland & Co has had to get people together multiple times recently for treating her less than the LEGEND she is really pisses me off,\" wrote one supportive follower on X. Another account added, \"People will STOP treating Kelly Rowland like some second-hand, and B list celebrity.\" As a source told the Daily Mail, Rowland \"set a clear boundary\" by \"advocating for herself\" in a situation that looked extremely uncomfortable -- nobody wants their personal space crossed.", "source": {"uri": "sheknows.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheKnows"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kristyn_burtt@sheknows.com", "name": "Kristyn Burtt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Rowland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Rowland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Costner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Costner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny's_Child", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Destiny's Child"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diamond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannes Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_with_Hoda_&_Jenna", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Today with Hoda & Jenna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(American_TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Today (American TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheWrap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TheWrap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glam_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glam rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah_Guthrie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Savannah Guthrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/kelly-rowland.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588003", "eventUri": "eng-9588003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

I told you not to talk to me like that.\"\n\nIt is unclear what the security staffer said to set off Rowland, as she had her back turned to the cameras.\n\nBut the former Destiny's Child member,43, was still irked when she reached the top of the steps to go into the \"Marcello Mio\" premiere, turning around and yelling, \"You still don't talk to me like that,\" according to Freeman.\n\nThe contretemps reportedly ignited because the guards who were helping stars navigate the busy carpet were being \"aggressive and Kelly was trying to ignore it,\" according to a source.\n\n\"By the time [Rowland] got to the last woman, she had had it because she scolded Kelly and told her to move when she was trying to wave to fans and help the paparazzi get their shot,\" the insider told the Daily Mail, claiming the Grammy winner did not \"care\" if she came off as a \"diva.\"\n\nRowland's rep didn't return Page Six's request for comment.\n\nThe blowup comes on the heels of the \"Bootylicious\" singer making headlines in February for walking off the set of the \"Today\" show.\n\nPage Six exclusively reported at the time that Rowland had dramatically exited the NBC morning show because her dressing room was not \"up to par,\" causing producers to scramble and find a replacement for the actress, who had been set to co-host the final hour with Hoda Kotb.\n\nAfter the media tsunami, Rowland's publicist issued a statement calling her client \"one of the kindest, most amiable humans I have ever met and have had the blessing to represent.\"", "source": {"uri": "pagesix.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Page Six"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Rowland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Rowland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannes Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny's_Child", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Destiny's Child"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootylicious", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bootylicious"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Publicist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diva", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoda_Kotb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hoda Kotb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heel (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breakfast television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paparazzi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paparazzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tsunami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/82425704.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588003", "eventUri": "eng-9588003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Kelly for further comment.\n\nKelly's reaction comes just weeks after the star walked out of an appearance on the Today show in February, though the reason for this has been disputed.\n\nIt had been claimed that Kelly skipped out on co-hosting the rest of the Today show alongside anchor Hoda Kotb because she was dissatisfied with her dressing room, forcing Rita Ora to step in at the last minute.\n\nHowever sources have since claimed that Kelly had actually walked off the show due to 'disrespect' shown to her by Hoda's co-host Savannah Guthrie who 'aggressively' questioned her about Beyonc\u00e9 - rather than ask the singer about what she was there to promote - her new film Mea Culpa.\n\nThe dressing room excuse was also even seemingly confirmed by Hoda herself, when she offered Rowland to share her dressing next time she comes on the show.\n\nHowever, it appears Hoda's comments stirred the pot even further, as an insider told The Wrap that Kelly left after she 'felt disrespected' after Guthrie asked her a series of questions about her friend and former bandmate Beyonc\u00e9.\n\n'Kelly was offended that Savannah repeatedly and aggressively asked her about Beyonc\u00e9,' the insider told the outlet.\n\n'Kelly was upset about Savannah's aggressive questioning about Beyonc\u00e9. She and her team were not happy and felt disrespected.'\n\nA source told TMZ soon after, however, that Kelly was not aggressively asked about Beyonce, and adamantly denied The Wrap's claims.\n\nThe Wrap insider said that the dressing room accommodations had nothing to do with Rowland's exit.\n\n'The story was spun that Kelly didn't like her dressing room, but she has been on the Today show numerous times, she and her team know the dressing room set up,' the insider said.\n\n'That would not come as a surprise at all.'\n\nBefore Rowland left the set of the NBC chat series, she was asked by Guthrie: 'What do you think about your friend Beyonc\u00e9?' to which she replied, 'I'm so proud of her.'\n\nGuthrie then veered the discussion toward Beyonc\u00e9's newly-announced foray into country music with her album Act II, asking Rowland, 'Were you surprised and what do you think about it?'\n\nRowland replied, 'I'm so proud of her - so happy for her.'\n\nThe insider told the outlet that Rowland and her team will not agree to an interview that involves questions about Beyonc\u00e9 and Destiny's Child, as 'she wants to leave that behind' and move forward in her career.\n\nThe Wrap reported that the Today show 'does not typically agree to interview topics being off-limits ahead of time,' which could have led to a miscommunication.\n\nAnother source told the outlet that Rowland left because of the shoddy dressing room accommodations.\n\nSeparate sources told TMZ that the issue was not about Beyonce, and the insider insisted that Rowland's exit was due to the show's dressing rooms - described as 'dumpy, glorified closets.'\n\nRowland's staffers were unsuccessful in procuring her a new dressing room, as another one upstairs was occupied by Jennifer Lopez, sources said.\n\nKelly failed to address the real reason for her decision to walk out of The Today Show, insisting in later interviews she was focused on promoting her new movie role.\n\nAhead of her security clash, Kelly had stunned on the red carpet in a red strapless custom Loewe gown with a lengthy train as she posed for snaps at the event.\n\nShowing off her svelte physique, Kelly's dress included a loose bodice that highlighted her ample cleavage.\n\nThe dress flowed into a floor-length skirt with a train that followed Kelly as she made her way along the red carpet.\n\nAdding a touch of glamour to her look, Kelly accessorised with a sparkly diamond necklace and clutch bag.\n\nFrench director Christophe Honor\u00e9 returned to Cannes Competition for a third time on Tuesday with comedy Mio Marcello, reuniting him with long time collaborator Chiara Mastroianni.\n\nThe comedy taps into the actress' real-life complex reality of being the daughter of cinema icons Catherine Deneuve and Marcello Mastroianni.\n\nCannes is the world's biggest film festival, first conceived in 1939 as an alternative to the then-fascist-influenced Venice Film Festival.\n\nIt has been held annually since 1946 except in 1948 and 1950, when it was cancelled due to lack of funds.\n\nThe festival is known for its carefully selected programme of films that have gone on to Oscar glory or launched the careers of directors like Quentin Tarantino.\n\nCannes' top prize is the Palme d'Or, or Golden Palm, whose past winners include Taxi Driver, Apocalypse Now, Pulp Fiction, The Pianist and Parasite.\n\nJane Campion became the first female director to win in 1993 with The Piano, followed by a nearly three-decade gap until Julia Ducournau received the award for Titane in 2021.\n\nJustine Triet became only the third female director to take the prize last year with Anatomy of a Fall.\n\nThere is also an honorary Palme d'Or, which is awarded in recognition of notable bodies of work, with past recipients including Harrison Ford , Jane Fonda and Clint Eastwood.\n\nThere are two honorary winners this year: George Lucas of 'Star Wars' and ' Indiana Jones' fame, and Japanese animation legend Studio Ghibli, the first group to receive the prize.\n\nOther awards include the Grand Prix, jury prize, best director, best actor, best actress, best screenplay and best short film.\n\nThe Cannes Film Festival officially kicked off on Tuesday night as celebrities walked the red carpet into the plush Grand Theatre Lumiere to honour Hollywood actor Meryl Streep before settling in to watch this year's opening film, The Second Act.\n\nAlmost as prestigious as winning the Palme d'Or, the Cannes Film Festival's top prize, is being on the jury that picks the winner.\n\nArtists from around the world who have made a name for themselves in their respective field are picked to sit on the jury, with one member designated as jury president.\n\nThis year's jury president, U.S. director Greta Gerwig, comes to Cannes after the massive success last summer of Barbie.\n\nShe is the first female U.S. director to serve as jury president, taking the baton from the head of the 2023 jury, Triangle of Sadness director and two-time Palme d'Or winner, Ruben Ostlund of Sweden.\n\nThe breakout star of Martin Scorsese 's Killers of the Flower Moon, Lily Gladstone returns to Cannes after becoming the first Native American woman to be nominated for an Oscar and winning a Golden Globe award for her performance.\n\nOne of the writers of the 2014 Palme d'Or-winning film Winter Sleep, Turkish photographer, actor and screenwriter Ebru Ceylan is a familiar face at the festival.\n\nHer first short film, On the Edge, was selected to compete at Cannes in 1998, and she has co-written several movies that were in the main competition line-up, including About Dry Grasses, Three Monkeys and The Wild Pear Tree.\n\nOne of the select few women who have starred in a James Bond film, French actor Eva Green is also on the jury.\n\nShe has an eclectic resume that includes Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven, smaller-scale projects like Nocebo and TV series Penny Dreadful.\n\nThe 12-time winner of Spain 's prestigious Goya Awards, Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona is on the jury.\n\nHe gained international recognition in 2007 with his first feature-length horror movie The Orphanage, produced by award-winning Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro .\n\nHis latest, the survival drama and Netflix hit 'Society of the Snow,' netted the director an Oscar nomination for best international feature film at this year's ceremony.\n\nAfter making a name with 2018's Capernaum, which earned her Golden Globe, BAFTA and Oscar nominations, Lebanese director and screenwriter Nadine Labaki, who has long had ties to Cannes, adds jury member to her list of accolades.\n\nOne of Italy's most famous actors with a parallel Hollywood career, Pierfrancesco Favino is no stranger to Cannes, having appeared in the competition films The Traitor, directed by Marco Bellocchio, and Mario Martone's Nostalgia and now on the jury.\n\nWinner of the 2018 Palme d'Or for Shoplifters, which also nabbed an Oscar nomination, acclaimed Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda returns as a main competition jury member after his film Monster won best screenplay at last year's festival.\n\nWith a Cesar award - France's equivalent of an Oscar - under his belt for The Intouchables as well as several successful blockbusters, French actor Omar Sy is a Cannes veteran.\n\nThe actor with parts in X-Men: Days of Future Past and Jurassic World starred in the opening film of the 2022 Un Certain Regard section at Cannes, Father & Soldier, and will now serve on the jury.", "source": {"uri": "todayheadline.co", "dataType":

Don't talk to me like that. You're not my momma. I told you not to talk to me like that.\"\n\nAnother said: \"It was very clear Kelly Rowland was trying to take photos and they were rushing her then that security guard stepped on her dress and Kelly tried to correct her nicely and the security guard decided to be rude and Kelly said, 'Don't talk to me like that'.\"\n\nA third added: \"The full video of Kelly Rowland fighting in Cannes. Apparently the security guards were rushing her, but in a very incisive way, you know, even rude. And the woman touched her, and if there's one thing that makes Americans happy, it's when you touch them for no reason.\"\n\nAnother said: \"Looks like you said, don't talk to me like that you're not my mother. Don't talk to me like that. Oh wowww. 'It looks like the security lady stepped on her dress, too. Initially, Kelly put her hand on her shoulder as if to say 'it's okay' but that security guard must have said something back she didn't like.\"\n\nDespite being pictured in the throes of the argument, according to a Daily Mail insider, Kelly \"doesn't care\" if she came across as a diva because she \"isn't fake and wanted to set a clear boundary\".", "source": {"uri": "hellomagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HELLO!"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jenni_mcknight@hellomagazine.com", "name": "Jenni McKnight", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Rowland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Rowland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannes"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cannes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paparazzi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paparazzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories_and_Patches", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories and Patches", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/7c1ab6dff365-kelly-rowland-security-guard-cannes.jpg?tx=c_fill,w_1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588003", "eventUri": "eng-9588003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

In video of the incident shared on social media, the 43-year-old performer appears to take issue with something that was said after the train of her dress was stepped on. Many fans on social media have speculated that it looks as though Rowland said, \"Don't talk to me like that.\"\n\nET has reached out to a representative for Rowland for comment.\n\nRowland wore a custom red gown by Anamika Khanna for the occasion, which featured a sweetheart neckline with draped fabric and a delicate train. She sparkled in show-stopping jewels by Messika.\n\nAccording to a post on her Instagram account, Rowland was in attendance at the event as a guest of the fragrance brand Kilian Paris.\n\n\"Cannes Film Festival Red Carpet Thank you... @kilianparis for having me!!\" she captioned a carousel of photos of her ensemble.\n\nRowland most recently starred in the Tyler Perry-directed drama, Mea Culpa, which began streaming on Netflix in February.\n\nMea Culpa tells the story of criminal defense attorney Mea Harper (Rowland), who takes on the murder case against Zyair Malloy (Trevante Rhodes), an artist accused of killing his girlfriend. As she tries to figure out if her cagey and seductive client is as innocent as he claims, Mea gets thrust into a world that's both hot and dangerous.\n\nThe film marked Rowland's first time working with Perry, whom she gushed about in an interview with ET.\n\n\"I was floored, one, with how focused he was and how he saw things in his brain before they happened. So I watched him assess the space and know where to go. His energy and how he maneuvers through a space in a scene is like... I just want to be a fly on the wall, just to know what he's thinking,\" she shared. \"I just love him. His Virgo qualities are just too strong not to love. And I love that he trusts his instincts.\"\n\nAt the film's New York City premiere, Rowland had the support of her longtime friends and former Destiny's Child group members -- Beyonc\u00e9 and Michelle Williams -- by her side.\n\nThat same month, Rowland made headlines amid multiple reports that she walked off the set of the Today show over a dressing room dispute.\n\nHer rep, Yvette Noel-Schure, told ET at the time, \"After 28 years of knowing her, Kelly Rowland remains one of the kindest, most amiable humans I have ever met and have had the blessing to represent.\"", "source": {"uri": "etonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Tonight"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Rowland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Rowland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamika_Khanna", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anamika Khanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevante_Rhodes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trevante Rhodes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carousel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carousel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfume", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perfume"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannes Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(American_TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Today (American TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Williams_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Williams (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny's_Child", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Destiny's Child"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2024-05/GettyImages-2153460399.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588003", "eventUri": "eng-9588003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

In an elegant red gown that matched the tapis rouge, Rowland posed for photos outside the Palais des Festivals at the 77th Cannes Film Festival in the south of France.\n\nDesigned by Anamika Khanna, the strapless dress featured a subtle sweetheart neckline and draping fabric that criss-crossed along the bodice. The sheer layered material was gathered to create a fitted look, leading to a short flowing train.\n\nThe Destiny's Child singer accessorized the look with bold jewelry statements, courtesy of Messika diamonds. She wore dangling diamond earrings to match a unique silver necklace resembling the wings of a bird; the necklace was also complete with a diamond centerpiece. Finally, a diamond-encrusted bangle made up of three bands adorned her left hand.\n\nAlthough at times obscured by her long gown, Rowland's footwear did not disappoint. Matching the rest of her accessories, her silver Jimmy Choo heels tied the look together. The pointed reflective toe peeked out beneath the dress to accentuate the refined red carpet look. A fan of bold colors recently, Rowland wore red pumps at a Baby2Baby event earlier this month.\n\nRowland held a small glittering silver clutch to finish off the look. Her platinum blond bob, styled by Haus of Shee, complemented her silver-focused aesthetic. Wilford Lenov styled Rowland's look for the premiere.\n\nRowland received attention on the carpet not only for her impressive sartorial choices but also for a seemingly tense moment that passed between her and a festival security guard. After being rushed along the carpet, Rowland appeared to express anger at a guard for continuously guiding her up the stairs in very close proximity to her.\n\n\"Marcello Mio,\" a French-Italian film directed by Christophe Honor\u00e9, focuses on actress Chiara Mastroianni and her real-life father Marcello Mastrioanni.

And maybe the touch just didn't sit well with the 43-year-old? We mean, security or no, touching shouldn't be required when a your words will do, right?\n\nAnother possible explanation is the security guard, who was clad in a black pantsuit, appeared to step on Kelly's dress in a video of the event!

A new video shows her seeming to get heated while talking to a security guard or usher while walking up the steps at the film festival. While it's not clear what exactly she had the heated exchange about, she seemed to be very upset with the staff member she was talking to.\n\nWhile walking the red carpet, Kelly, 43, was greeted by a staff member who tried to usher her up the steps. After reaching the first landing, she turned back and waved at photographers, when the staff member came up and put her arm out and seemed to try to get her to move up the stairs. The staff member had her arm up around the \"Motivation\" singer and Kelly appeared to be speaking to her as she ushered her away. Shortly after though, Kelly turned and seemed to scold her, pointing her finger at her.\n\nKelly continued walking up the stairs and a blonde woman joined her and began talking to the staff member. The actress then turned around and appeared to say more to the staff member, continuing to point her finger, but it's unclear what she was saying.\n\nThe Destiny's Child alum has not publicly commented on the incident, but a source close to the situation gave some more context in a report from Daily Mail. \"The people who are assigned to helping stars walk the red carpet were being aggressive and Kelly was trying to ignore it,\" they told the outlet. \"By the time she got to the last woman she had had it because she scolded Kelly and told her to move when she was trying to wave to fans and help the paparazzi get their shot.\"\n\nWhile the details of the heated exchange are not confirmed, Kelly did look stunning at the event. She wore a gorgeous strap-less red gown, designed by Anamika Khanna. She accessorized with jewelry from Messika, including a beautiful diamond-encrusted necklace. Her hair was styled into a platinum blonde bob for the event. She shared a few more shots of her look on her Instagram.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodlife.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hollywood Life"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_crowley@hollywoodlife.com", "name": "James Crowley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Rowland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Rowland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannes Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_recording_certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music recording certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamika_Khanna", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anamika Khanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_cut", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bob cut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny's_Child", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Destiny's Child"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paparazzi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paparazzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/kelly-rowland-heated-exchange-cannes-ftr.jpg?quality=100&w=620", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588003", "eventUri": "eng-9588003", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 128, "textEnd": 134}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

After photos of the incident were shared online, it was reported that Kelly 'had enough' of the 'aggressive' security staff.\n\nFans even rushed to social media to share what they believed really happened, with one claiming the security guard was being 'rude'. In a tweet shared on X, formerly known as Twitter, one person shared a few snaps of Kelly pointing her finger at a member of staff along with a video of it.\n\nThey explained in the caption: \"It was very clear Kelly Rowland was trying to take photos and they were rushing her then that security guard stepped on her dress and Kelly tried to correct her nicely and the security guard decided to be rude and Kelly said 'Don't talk to me like that'.\"\n\nFrom the video, it looked like one member of staff stepped on her dress while trying to rush Kelly into the venue - who was happy posing for photos on the red carpet. The same user later took to the comment section to clarify that the dress actually 'snagged on the red carpet'.\n\n\"Actually she didn't step on the dress, it snagged on the carpet but she still said 'don't talk to me like that',\" they wrote.

The argument started after the security guard held up her arm to guide Kelly into the venue.\n\nIt's not the first time Kelly has been involved in a major diva moment. She previously walked out of the Today show in what was believed to be a row about dressing rooms. Here, we've taken a look at her biggest diva moments.\n\nCannes Film Festival\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Scarlett Johansson slams 'eerily similar' AI voice after she denied ChatGPT company offer\n\nKelly seemed furious when a security guard tried guiding her up the steps at the Cannes Film Festival. The singer wagged her finger at the woman as they exchanged words. The argument seemed to be over when Kelly continued to walk up the stairs, but she then turned back to continue admonishing the security guard.\n\nIt's unclear what the pair were saying, but sources claim staff members at the festival were being \"aggressive\". The Mirror has approached Kelly's representatives for comment as well as the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nSpeaking to the Daily Mail, a source said the argument happened after Kelly \"had it\" with the behaviour of the security guards. They explained: \"The people who are assigned to helping stars walk the red carpet were being aggressive and Kelly was trying to ignore it.\"\n\nThey added: \"By the time she got to the last woman she had had it because she scolded Kelly and told her to move when she was trying to wave to fans and help the paparazzi get their shot.\" The source also said Kelly \"doesn't care if she comes across like a diva\".\n\nToday show drama\n\nKelly's tense exchange with the security guard comes just weeks after she walked out of an appearance on the Today Show in February. It had been claimed Kelly walked out of her hosting duties because she was unhappy with her dressing room.\n\nRita Ora is then said to have been forced to step in last minute. However, sources have since insisted Kelly walked off the show after the show's co-host Savannah Guthrie \"aggressively\" questioned her about Beyonc\u00e9 instead of asking about her new film Mea Culpa.\n\nAn insider told The Wrap Kelly \"felt disrespected\". They explained: \"Kelly was offended that Savannah repeatedly and aggressively asked her about Beyonc\u00e9. Kelly was upset about Savannah's aggressive questioning about Beyonc\u00e9. She and her team were not happy and felt disrespected.\"\n\nDefending Madonna's diva demands\n\nMadonna came under fire back in 2008 for her diva demands during Radio 1's Big Weekend. The singer landed by helicopter on a nearby cricket pitch during a game, demanded a specific type of water backstage and allowed her huge entourage to take food and drinks reserved for other artists.\n\nWhile other people were furious with Madonna, Kelly jumped to her defence. \"Madonna can have anything she wants. If she only wants red Skittles then get her red Skittles, she's freakin' Madonna! And if she wants a huge trailer, get her a huge trailer,\" she said at the time.\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scarlett_o_toole@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Scarlett O'Toole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Rowland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Rowland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diva", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cannes Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(American_TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Today (American TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scarlett Johansson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paparazzi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paparazzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_1's_Big_Weekend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheWrap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TheWrap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madonna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skittles_(confectionery)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skittles (confectionery)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah_Guthrie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Savannah Guthrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Ora", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rita Ora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32864204.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_kellymain.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588003", "eventUri": "eng-9588003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

According to reports, the Destiny's Child singer \"doesn't care\" if she comes across as being a diva either.\n\nIt is claimed that the altercation broke out after a member of the security team had held up her arm to lead former X Factor star Kelly into the venue. It is understood that the singer had been \"trying to ignore\" the \"aggressive\" behaviour as she posed for pictures and spoke to fans.\n\nREAD MORE: Dolly Parton's hubby is desperate for threesome with Friends star Jennifer Aniston\n\nREAD MORE: Want more showbiz? Daily Star has just the thing for you\n\nThe chart-topper showed up to the premiere of the French film Marcello Mio, wearing a stunning red floor length gown. She teamed her glam look with silver accessories and sported a platinum blonde sharp-cut bob.\n\nA source told the Daily Mail, that Kelly had been putting up with the \"aggressive\" antics from the security team from the moment she entered the red carpet. By the time she reached the last person, she'd \"had it\".\n\nThey told the publication: \"She doesn't care if she comes across like a diva if she knows that she is advocating for herself. She isn't fake and wanted to set a clear boundary.\"\n\n\"The people who are assigned to helping stars walk the red carpet were being aggressive and Kelly was trying to ignore it. By the time she got to the last woman she had had it because she scolded Kelly and told her to move when she was trying to wave to fans and help the paparazzi get their shot,\" the insider added.\n\nIn the footage from the heated moment, Kelly can be seen visibly annoyed as she warned the staff member with her finger raised, in front of the entire crowd. The security person seemed frantic at first but carried on with duties of getting the star safely into the venue.\n\nDaily Star has contacted Kelly's team for further comment.\n\nIt comes after it was reported back in February that Kelly had been dissatisfied over her dressing room for her appearance on the Today show. The Dilemma star bowed out at the last minute, with Rita Ora stepping in to take her spot on the programme in the last hour.\n\nSince then, sources have disputed dressing room claims explaining that Kelly had actually walked out after she'd believed \"disrespect\" was shown by Savannah Guthrie. Insiders claim that host Savannah had \"aggressively\" quizzed her about her former bandmate Beyonc\u00e9, instead of her new film Mea Culpa.\n\nThe source told The Wrap: \"Kelly was offended that Savannah repeatedly and aggressively asked her about Beyonc\u00e9 ... She and her team were not happy and felt disrespected.\"\n\nWant all the biggest Showbiz and TV news straight to your inbox?

The reason isn't important, but many beautiful celebrity women are invited to Cannes to pretty up the red carpets and represent various beauty, fashion or jewelry contracts. As Kelly was trying to walk up the famous steps, a security guard - or perhaps an assistant, according to some outlets, although I think this woman was security - began rushing Kelly as several other people circled her as she made her way up the steps. Several of these people even got in between Kelly and the photographers. It was like the security people were trying to rush Kelly and simultaneously ensure that Kelly's photos were bad or unusable. Here's a video of the incident, and you can see Kelly reacting:\n\nSomeone said Kelly told off the security woman because the woman stepped on her dress but I don't think so? Something tugged at Kelly's dress but I think it was just the carpet snagging. It feels more like Kelly was mad at being rushed up the steps and not allowed to pose, although it definitely looks like that particular security woman might have said something. Anyway, I'm on Team Kelly.

A female security guard then stretched her arm behind the \"Motivation\" singer as she urged her to continue walking up the steps. While the Georgia native initially shrugged off the first interaction with security, the situation took a turn when Kelly appeared to yell at the security guard and point a finger in the woman's face.\n\nAfter the footage went viral on social media, users were quick to try to lip-read what Kelly said to the security guard.\n\n\"Don't talk to me like that. I'm not a child. Don't talk to me like that,\" one X user guessed. Meanwhile, another added, \"It looks like she said 'Don't talk to me like that. You're not my momma. I'm not a child.'\"\n\n\"Kelly didn't want her touching her backside, she said 'Don't touch me like that! I'm not playing!'\" a third quipped.\n\nKelly has yet to address the drama as of publication, simply taking to Instagram to share photos of her glamorous red dress. \"Cannes Film Festival Red Carpet Thank you ... @kilianparis for having me!! @messika for the [diamond emojis] @anamikakhanna.in for the red dress,\" she captioned the snap.\n\nThe \"Dilemma\" songstress was asked during an appearance on Chicago's WGN News on February 22 why she'd chosen not to fulfill her hosting duty but declined to speak about it. \"No, because I'm so excited and delighted to be here to talk about the movie and nothing else,\" she responded, promoting her new Netflix drama Mea Culpa instead. \"I love the Today show, love Hoda and that is it.\"\n\nAccording to multiple reports, Kelly's departure from the talk show stemmed from allegedly being disappointed with her dressing room. Savannah, 52, seemingly confirmed the outdated accommodations when speaking to Entertainment Tonight.\n\n\"We need a remodel. We need Extreme Makeover: Today Show Dressing Room Edition,\" the Today show star said on February 21. \"We are in a historic studio, 1A. It's the same studio that has been used for decades.

The Dexys frontman says he can recall his life in vivid detail. \"It's ridiculously good,\" he says. \"I can remember what people were wearing, describe a room. Mad stuff like that.\"\n\nSo he is sceptical about Searching for Dexys Midnight Runners, a book published on June 6, in which dozens of current and former members of the band he founded more than 45 years ago talk about their time in one of the best-selling British acts of the 1980s.\n\nDexys (Rowland shortened the name in 2011) has always had a revolving-door policy to its lineup. Some members - trombonist Jim Paterson, guitarist Kevin Archer, violinist Helen O'Hara among them - he says were core to the band; others were hired hands. Not everyone shares his powers of recall, and not everyone was as invested as he was.\n\nRowland did not cooperate with the book. \"I'm not interested,\" he says. What seems to concern him most is Dexys being packaged for the nostalgia market. \"It wouldn't be enough for me to just look back and say, 'Oh, it was great back then'. That would be death to me. It's about what I'm doing now.\"\n\nAt 70, the irrepressible Rowland is more productive than ever. We are in his local pub, a smart Hackney hangout, to talk about Dexys' next release - a live version of 2023's critically acclaimed album The Feminine Divine - and the band's forthcoming nine-date UK and Ireland tour of the same album, which includes a coveted evening slot on Glastonbury's Park Stage on Friday night.\n\nThe Feminine Divine is a concept album, a confessional Rowland biography of sorts, in nine songs. It tells the story of his 30-year progress from a sexist male who saw women as possessions to be protected (a mindset he attributes in part to his upbringing) to an enlightened champion of women.\n\nThe first track, The One That Loves You, he wrote in the early 1990s. \"It's basically saying, if anyone tries it on with my woman, I'm going to hit him,\" he says. \"That's exactly how I thought and felt.\"\n\nThe rest of the songs are new, soulful compositions celebrating Rowland's abandonment of his ego in a female-led relationship.\n\nI wonder if the MeToo movement changed him, but he says there was no epiphany. He started to shed his machismo after 1993, when he went into a recovery programme from cocaine addiction, after years lost to the drug following the commercial failure of Dexys' third album.\n\nHis therapy revealed all sorts of ingrained unhappiness. \"My dad was a tough guy. He wasn't going around fighting everybody, but I'd somehow picked up that that was what I needed to do. Otherwise I was going to get trod upon. I realised it had been a big mask, that macho thing I grew up with.\"\n\nI'm struck by the contrasting joyfulness of I'm Going to Get Free, the album's third track, and a recent single - a maddeningly catchy song in which Rowland and his backing singers act out a kind of therapy session.\n\nIt sounds like redemption. \"I thought it was a strong statement. I meant every word,\" he says.\n\nRowland was born to an Irish Catholic family in Wolverhampton in 1953 and spent his childhood moving around, first to Ireland, back to Wolverhampton then to north London.\n\n\"It was a working-class background. If your dad's a builder and you're of Irish descent, absolutely. I never really met middle-class people until I came into the music business.\"\n\nAs a young man, he loved Philadelphia soul, and was gripped by Roxy Music. Bryan Ferry was the biggest influence on his vocal style. \"When I first heard him, I thought what the f-k is that? It was brilliant.\"\n\nRowland's tough background gave him phenomenal drive and productivity. He had a clear vision for Dexys Midnight Runners in the late 70s and early 80s, which led to early commercial success. The band's second single, 1980's Geno, went to number one.\n\nHe concedes he was a taskmaster, insisting on full-time rehearsals, mandatory uniforms of woolly hats and donkey jackets, even an exercise programme involving running as a group to bring out a collective fighting spirit.\n\nCould he have had a career in pop music if he were starting out today? \"I don't think so, no. One big factor was the dole, unemployment benefit you could live on. I'm not sure you can now, I don't know if you can survive. But you could then. We did that for two years and we rehearsed and we saw it as our student grant.\"\n\nThe 1980 album Searching for the Young Soul Rebels was followed by the platinum-selling Too-Rye-Ay with its monster global hit Come on Eileen.\n\nIn the early 1980s the UK was convulsed by the Troubles. The cover of Young Soul Rebels featured a newspaper photograph of a boy fleeing his Belfast home, clutching his possessions as civil unrest breaks out around him.\n\nShortly after Come on Eileen was released in the summer of 1982, the IRA killed 11 people with bombings of military parades in Hyde Park and Regent's Park. Rowland describes how, when the track was played for the first time on a Birmingham radio station, a presenter apologised for its Irish-inflections \"just because it was Irish-sounding\".\n\nThe lyrics were far from political. But Rowland says he felt a duty to bring Irish inflections into music in a febrile time. \"It felt subversive. You weren't supposed to say anything about Ireland in the 1980s. Nobody wanted to hear it. Even people on the Left didn't talk about it, and I felt Irish culture was misunderstood.\"\n\nThen came long periods of disappointment. Dexys' 1985 album Don't Stand Me Down failed to sell. \"It was heartbreaking, we couldn't have done anything better than that album,\" he says. \"We took too long, three years and the whole landscape had changed. Live Aid had happened, we didn't get asked. Everything seemed bigger, more corporate.\"\n\nRowland hurtled into cocaine use, lost much of his fortune and began recovery. Then 1999's My Beauty, his comeback solo album of covers in which he reinterpreted lyrics to reflect his own experiences and appeared on the cover wearing a dress and stockings, was met with bafflement and derision. He was accused of having a nervous breakdown. Even the Guardian ran a Rowland interview with the headline \"Frocky Horror\".\n\n\"And that's the Guardian! Unbelievable.\" I suggest he was 20 years too early for the era of gender fluidity. He agrees. \"I was doing what felt intuitively the right thing to do for me. The worst thing was everyone thought it was fine to say those things.\"\n\nWhen Rowland saunters to the bar to order another mineral water, the pub's punters nudge one another in whispered recognition of one of British music's most distinctive frontmen. His star quality comes from an almost supernatural calmness and an elevated sense of style.\n\nRowland is wearing an outsized baker's cap, an apple-green jumper, white baggies, plimsolls and a long, herringbone coat with a plush fur collar. He could be a particularly well put-together gangster - he tells me he designs his clothes himself with the help of a seamstress in Dalston.\n\nRowland might not endorse the forthcoming book. But I point out its publication suggests a loyal fanbase. He agrees. In fact, he is drawing on his excellent memory to write his own story - a project he started 20 years ago. \"I'm just finishing it,\" he says. \"I don't know what the word memoir means, but I've written about my life.\" He hopes to publish the book imminently, though he says he keeps tweaking it.\n\nAs we leave the pub, he spies my preview copy of Searching for Dexys Midnight Runners.\n\n\"Now I'm curious about that book,\" he says. \"It seems kind of an anoraky idea to me, but there you go... I might even read it, just for the hell of it.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Destiny's Child vocalist was one of the guests at the premiere of Marcello Mio, the cinematographic tribute to the great Marcello Mastronianni; her when she became the involuntary protagonist of a moment of considerable tension with one of the festival's security team workers.\n\nThe artist was seen posing on the red carpet, wearing a spectacular dress by designer Anamika Khanna and stunning jewelry by Messika. The problem, however, began when the vocalist was preparing to climb the stairs to enter the venue.\n\nThe singer, 43, was climbing the famous steps under the watchful eyes of the photographers gathered there when one of the festival's security team workers seemed to put her hand on her shoulder, something that the artist did not like at all.\n\nAt that moment, an apparent dispute began between the singer and the employee, who was trying to guide her in the right direction. According to some interpreters who have been able to decipher on social networks, the singer can be seen shouting: \"Don't talk to me like that. Don't talk to me like that. You are not my mother. \"Don't talk to me like that.\"\n\nThe images circulating on social networks, where they have already gone viral, show the singer, furious, raising her finger at the member of the security team and very upset, while going up the stairs.\n\nAccording to what the British newspaper The Daily Mail has learned, Beyonc\u00e9's cousin would have been very upset with the festival workers, who were very \"aggressive\" with her, even though she tried to ignore them.\n\n\"When she got to the last woman, she was already fed up,\" says the source consulted by the newspaper, who explains that the worker \"scolded\" the artist, asking her to move when she was trying to greet her followers and continue posing.\n\nAccording to the source, the singer does not care that people consider that she was a \"diva\", because she considers that she was defending herself, her physical integrity and her freedom.\n\nThis is the second altercation of this type that Kelly Rowland has experienced this year. Just a few months ago, the singer became the protagonist of the controversy after her non-appearance on The Today Show, after having some problem with the dressing room that had been assigned to her, not in accordance with her preferences, which she felt was a \"lack.\" of respect\".\n\nThe artist, who was supposed to participate as co-host of the morning show, left abruptly after disagreements with the dressing room, forcing the program to call singer Rita Ora to replace her at the last minute.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Rowland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Rowland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cannes Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamika_Khanna", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anamika Khanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny's_Child", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Destiny's Child"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinematography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(American_TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Today (American TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diva", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Ora", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rita Ora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breakfast television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_a2d0b.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588003", "eventUri": "eng-9588003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

One dress had us awe-struck, a red gown by Anamika Khanna.\n\nKelly Rowland never ceases to amaze us. Over at the Cannes Film Festival, the singer is showing attendees and fans what it takes to breathe some life into the red carpet. One look in particular has us transfixed. Yesterday when attending the Marcello Mio debut Rowland appeared in an exquisite fiery red gown by Anamika Khanna.\n\nThe lustrous gown worn by Rowland was comprised of an assortment of curve-hugging fabrics all in one tone: fire engine red. It seemingly floated on her figure in images she took ahead of arriving to the red carpet. Paired with Kelly's frock were jewels by Messika. The necklace she wore, bracelet and drop earrings featured striking diamonds. Her ensemble which was accompanied by Rowland's cherry white bob and a natural look by celebrity makeup artist Sir John birthed an incredibly stylish fashion moment.\n\nThere's even more proof of Rowland's status as a style star. Today in Cannes for the premiere of Le Comte De Monte-Cristo she donned a brilliant white off-shoulder gown. The waist of the gown included a metallic silver embellishment. Though the train wasn't lengthy this moment was as equally fashionable as the look she wore yesterday. On her neck, she wore a minimalistic silver necklace which was elegantly paired with mod-ish circle earrings.\n\nSince Rowland is never one to shy away from expressing herself through style, her Cannes Film Festival looks come as no surprise to us. In recent months she's made appearances in expressive pieces by Charles Harbison, Louis Vuitton, and more. Kollin Carter is one of the stylists she regularly works with-with him memorable instances ensue.\n\nRed however is one hue that we love to see her in. A few months ago, ahead of the release of her latest film Mea Culpa, for a press event she wore a bright red leather set with a matching fur coat. In another instance, she was an office siren in a sleek white outfit made up of an oversized blazer and matching trousers. This level of versatility is why we cherish each moment Rowland brings us.", "source": {"uri": "essence.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Essence"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Rowland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Rowland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamika_Khanna", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anamika Khanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cannes Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_cut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bob cut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracelet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bracelet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diamond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cherry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blazer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Vuitton", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louis Vuitton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minimalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur_clothing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fur clothing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trousers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trousers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hue"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film_Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film Festivals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/kelly-rowland-cannes-film-festival.png?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588003", "eventUri": "eng-9588003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

If you didn't see, she totally blew her lid on a security guard at the event while walking the Marcello Mio red carpet in an elegant gown, diamond necklace, and blunt blonde bob. See pics (below):\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by TMZ (@tmz_tv)\n\nYeesh, we'd hate to be that lady!\n\nRelated: Inside Jennifer Lopez's Daily 'Frustration' With Ben Affleck\n\nAt the time, your guess was pretty much as good as ours as far was what led Kelly to get so upset. But we now have some firmer answers! On Wednesday, an insider told DailyMail.com that the Dilemma singer blew up after she'd \"had it\" with the security team \"being aggressive.\" The source explained:\n\n\"The people who are assigned to helping stars walk the red carpet were being aggressive and Kelly was trying to ignore it. By the time she got to the last woman she had had it because she scolded Kelly and told her to move when she was trying to wave to fans and help the paparazzi get their shot.\"\n\nIn the pic, you can see the lady putting a firm arm behind Kelly, almost forcing her up the stairs instead of letting her take her time on the carpet. The insider added:\n\n\"[Kelly] doesn't care if she comes across like a diva if she knows that she is advocating for herself. She isn't fake and wanted to set a clear boundary.\"\n\nWell, the boundary was definitely set! And the whole world saw!

The Dexys frontman says he can recall his life in vivid detail. \"It's ridiculously good,\" he says. \"I can remember what people were wearing, describe a room. Mad stuff like that.\"\n\nSo he is sceptical about Searching for Dexys Midnight Runners, a book published on June 6, in which dozens of current and former members of the band he founded more than 45 years ago talk about their time in one of the best-selling British acts of the 1980s.\n\nDexys (Rowland shortened the name in 2011) has always had a revolving-door policy to its lineup. Some members - trombonist Jim Paterson, guitarist Kevin Archer, violinist Helen O'Hara among them - he says were core to the band; others were hired hands. Not everyone shares his powers of recall, and not everyone was as invested as he was.\n\nRowland did not cooperate with the book. \"I'm not interested,\" he says. What seems to concern him most is Dexys being packaged for the nostalgia market. \"It wouldn't be enough for me to just look back and say, 'Oh, it was great back then'. That would be death to me. It's about what I'm doing now.\"\n\nAt 70, the irrepressible Rowland is more productive than ever. We are in his local pub, a smart Hackney hangout, to talk about Dexys' next release - a live version of 2023's critically acclaimed album The Feminine Divine - and the band's forthcoming nine-date UK and Ireland tour of the same album, which includes a coveted evening slot on Glastonbury's Park Stage on Friday night.\n\nThe Feminine Divine is a concept album, a confessional Rowland biography of sorts, in nine songs. It tells the story of his 30-year progress from a sexist male who saw women as possessions to be protected (a mindset he attributes in part to his upbringing) to an enlightened champion of women.\n\nThe first track, The One That Loves You, he wrote in the early 1990s. \"It's basically saying, if anyone tries it on with my woman, I'm going to hit him,\" he says. \"That's exactly how I thought and felt.\"\n\nThe rest of the songs are new, soulful compositions celebrating Rowland's abandonment of his ego in a female-led relationship.\n\nI wonder if the MeToo movement changed him, but he says there was no epiphany. He started to shed his machismo after 1993, when he went into a recovery programme from cocaine addiction, after years lost to the drug following the commercial failure of Dexys' third album.\n\nHis therapy revealed all sorts of ingrained unhappiness. \"My dad was a tough guy. He wasn't going around fighting everybody, but I'd somehow picked up that that was what I needed to do. Otherwise I was going to get trod upon. I realised it had been a big mask, that macho thing I grew up with.\"\n\nI'm struck by the contrasting joyfulness of I'm Going to Get Free, the album's third track, and a recent single - a maddeningly catchy song in which Rowland and his backing singers act out a kind of therapy session.\n\nWere you frightened?\n\nI was\n\nOf your violence?\n\nOh, yeah. I had so much hate in me\n\nI stopped and I looked and I said to myself, I'm not liking what I see\n\nAnd now I'm going to get free\n\nIt sounds like redemption. \"I thought it was a strong statement. I meant every word,\" he says.\n\nRowland was born to an Irish Catholic family in Wolverhampton in 1953 and spent his childhood moving around, first to Ireland, back to Wolverhampton then to north London.\n\n\"It was a working-class background. If your dad's a builder and you're of Irish descent, absolutely. I never really met middle-class people until I came into the music business.\"\n\nAs a young man, he loved Philadelphia soul, and was gripped by Roxy Music. Bryan Ferry was the biggest influence on his vocal style. \"When I first heard him, I thought what the f-k is that? It was brilliant.\"\n\nRowland's tough background gave him phenomenal drive and productivity. He had a clear vision for Dexys Midnight Runners in the late 70s and early 80s, which led to early commercial success. The band's second single, 1980's Geno, went to number one.\n\nHe concedes he was a taskmaster, insisting on full-time rehearsals, mandatory uniforms of woolly hats and donkey jackets, even an exercise programme involving running as a group to bring out a collective fighting spirit.\n\nCould he have had a career in pop music if he were starting out today? \"I don't think so, no. One big factor was the dole, unemployment benefit you could live on. I'm not sure you can now, I don't know if you can survive. But you could then. We did that for two years and we rehearsed and we saw it as our student grant.\"\n\nThe 1980 album Searching for the Young Soul Rebels was followed by the platinum-selling Too-Rye-Ay with its monster global hit Come on Eileen.\n\nIn the early 1980s the UK was convulsed by the Troubles. The cover of Young Soul Rebels featured a newspaper photograph of a boy fleeing his Belfast home, clutching his possessions as civil unrest breaks out around him.\n\nShortly after Come on Eileen was released in the summer of 1982, the IRA killed 11 people with bombings of military parades in Hyde Park and Regent's Park. Rowland describes how, when the track was played for the first time on a Birmingham radio station, a presenter apologised for its Irish-inflections \"just because it was Irish-sounding\".\n\nThe lyrics were far from political. But Rowland says he felt a duty to bring Irish inflections into music in a febrile time. \"It felt subversive. You weren't supposed to say anything about Ireland in the 1980s. Nobody wanted to hear it. Even people on the Left didn't talk about it, and I felt Irish culture was misunderstood.\"\n\nThen came long periods of disappointment. Dexys' 1985 album Don't Stand Me Down failed to sell. \"It was heartbreaking, we couldn't have done anything better than that album,\" he says. \"We took too long, three years and the whole landscape had changed. Live Aid had happened, we didn't get asked. Everything seemed bigger, more corporate.\"\n\nRowland hurtled into cocaine use, lost much of his fortune and began recovery. Then 1999's My Beauty, his comeback solo album of covers in which he reinterpreted lyrics to reflect his own experiences and appeared on the cover wearing a dress and stockings, was met with bafflement and derision. He was accused of having a nervous breakdown. Even the Guardian ran a Rowland interview with the headline \"Frocky Horror\".\n\n\"And that's the Guardian! Unbelievable.\" I suggest he was 20 years too early for the era of gender fluidity. He agrees. \"I was doing what felt intuitively the right thing to do for me. The worst thing was everyone thought it was fine to say those things.\"\n\nWhen Rowland saunters to the bar to order another mineral water, the pub's punters nudge one another in whispered recognition of one of British music's most distinctive frontmen. His star quality comes from an almost supernatural calmness and an elevated sense of style.\n\nRowland is wearing an outsized baker's cap, an apple-green jumper, white baggies, plimsolls and a long, herringbone coat with a plush fur collar. He could be a particularly well put-together gangster - he tells me he designs his clothes himself with the help of a seamstress in Dalston.\n\nRowland might not endorse the forthcoming book. But I point out its publication suggests a loyal fanbase. He agrees. In fact, he is drawing on his excellent memory to write his own story - a project he started 20 years ago. \"I'm just finishing it,\" he says. \"I don't know what the word memoir means, but I've written about my life.\" He hopes to publish the book imminently, though he says he keeps tweaking it.\n\nAs we leave the pub, he spies my preview copy of Searching for Dexys Midnight Runners.\n\n\"Now I'm curious about that book,\" he says. \"It seems kind of an anoraky idea to me, but there you go... I might even read it, just for the hell of it.\"\n\nThe Feminine Divine Live is released on May 24. Dexys tour begins on May 24; tickets: dexysofficial.com.

Speaking to the Daily Mail, a source said the argument happened after Kelly \"had it\" with the behaviour of the security guards.

However, the usher persistently kept touching the singer's arm and said something that appeared to upset the artist.

A woman accompanying Rowland also confronted the usher, seemingly questioning her actions. The usher then touched the woman accompanying the singer, seemingly pushing the group towards the theater's doors.\n\nA lip reading expert told Page Six that Rowland appeared to tell the usher during their exchange, \"Don't talk to me like that.

Kelly Rowland Berates Red Carpet Usher At 2024 Cannes Film Festival", "body": "Donning a fiery red look, Kelly Rowland set the red carpet ablaze at the Cannes Film Festival. But fans want all the smoke with a female usher who seemingly prompted the glowing actress to go off.\n\nOn May 21, the Mea Culpa star posted a beautiful Instagram carousel of photos. She stuns in an icy blonde bob, dazzling jewels and an elegant scarlet red gown for her appearance at the 77th Cannes Film Festival. The post garnered attention for Kelly's charm, but it also attracted some loyal fans who were ready to defend, pull up to the festival and back her up against a mouthy red carpet usher.\n\n\"Kelly, what did the lady say to you to make you go off on her? We all want to know,\" one fan in the comments section posed.\n\nA video shows Kelly ascending tall steps as ushers indicate that she should start walking into the Palais des Festivals et des Congr\u00e8s. As the former Destiny's Child member warmly smiles and waves at the crowd of cameras, a trio of other ushers hold out their arms to block her line of sight and create a barrier around her. Subsequently, two more ushers direct Kelly up the steps to keep the flow of the red carpet going.\n\nIn pursuit, one of the ushers, a woman in a black suit, continuously stretches her arm across Kelly's back. The mother of two shrugs the usher off by touching her arm as if to tell her that it's not necessary, but the usher mouthed some words that the \"Motivation\" singer did not take lightly.\n\nIn the video, Kelly reprimands the usher with her pointer finger, uttering, \"Don't talk to me like that.\"\n\nShe repeated the remark a few times before her final scolding.\n\nThen she blasted out, \"You are not my mother!\"\n\nA woman in black casual attire who initially helped Kelly up the stairs intervenes by grabbing the unidentified usher's arm. Meanwhile, a male usher checks in on his disgraced teammate, who laughs off the incident as the irritated 43-year-old star gracefully continues into the Palais des Festivals et des Congr\u00e8s.\n\nThough the details of the usher's words are unclear, Kelly fans are riding for her hard in the comments section of her festival Instagram post.\n\n\"'Don't talk to me like that!' TELL THEY ASS KELLY!!! You look good!\" a fan praised.\n\nA devoted fan wrote, \"We ride at dawn!\"\n\n\"Okay, you look gorgeous and all, but what time are we riding back to the festival for little miss thing thing?\" another fan agreed.\n\nComedian and host Jessie Woo chimed in, commenting, \"Yaaaasss, Ms Kelly [Rowland].

Red carpet backlogs can be a nightmare for celebrities as well as security and when time is tight in terms of each individual appearance there will often be a lot of steering going on.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "harry_rutter@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Harry Rutter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Rowland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Rowland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip_reading", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lip reading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny's_Child", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Destiny's Child"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannes Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MailOnline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MailOnline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_finger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The finger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventriloquism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ventriloquism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_(law_enforcement)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baton (law enforcement)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32869576.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_KELLY-MAIN.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588003", "eventUri": "eng-9588003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

It's like toga party, but make it so classy. The oversized proportions and lack of lace keep the dress strictly catwalk, not walk-down-the-aisle.\n\nRowland accessorized with diamond and pearl jewelry and wore her hair slicked back to achieve the \"wet look.\"\n\nBritish Vogue has declared the \"pop of red\" trend \"retired\" and is fully on board with white dresses for spring/summer. \"The white dress is for the woman who bought into quiet luxury, but wants more from her restrained palette of oatmeals and taupes...she's into folklore, but also skateboarding...she wants to subvert archaic ideas around female stereotypes. She most certainly wants to look sexy in her lace. And she doesn't care if you think, say, her Valentino cut-out mini is too mini,\" the magazine explained. Note taken, but, Rowland's actually not ready to retire her pops of red, thankyouverymuch.\n\nThe day before this lovely white ensemble, Kelly Rowland attended the Marcello Mio Cannes screening in a beautiful scarlet Anamika Khanna gown, with Messika jewelry and Jimmy Choo shoes.\n\nRowland likes dark eyeliner, good highlighter, and a glossy nude lip, and gosh darn it, she's gonna stick with that!\n\nFirst red, now white...if blue is next, this is officially an Americana Cowboy Carter tie-in moment. But she looks so good in red and white we also kinda want her to just keep repeating those two.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Rowland", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Rowland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Count of Monte Cristo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannes"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cannes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Vogue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Vogue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pearl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fashion show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diamond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Folklore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboarding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skateboarding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentino_(fashion_house)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valentino (fashion house)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamika_Khanna", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anamika Khanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Choo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Choo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stereotype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nudity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NFJFs5UMThyEpD2nlEbazA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xNzIxO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/glamour_497/5e20ecde99b171eaad9d5fb7e8b1767f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588003", "eventUri": "eng-9588003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

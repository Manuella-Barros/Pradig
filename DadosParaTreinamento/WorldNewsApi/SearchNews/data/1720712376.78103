Jill Canovan was discovered near a railway station just after 4am on Monday (June 3). Emergency services rushed to the scene at Heaton Chapel, in Stockport, but the mum-of-two was pronounced dead at the scene, the Manchester Evening News reports. Jill, 46, leaves behind devastated daughters Amber, 25 and Jordan, 23. Speaking for the first time about the tragedy, Amber said she is struggling to come to terms with the loss of \"her best friend\". Amber has moved into a hotel because she can't bear being at home - hoping for her mum to walk through the door. Recalling the moment she was given the news she said: \"I literally had nothing in my brain,\u201d \u201cI just felt numb. I still don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s real. My sister moved out so it\u2019s just been me and my mum every day. I just feel like she\u2019s going to walk through the door, like she\u2019s not really gone. \u201cEspecially the way it happened \u2013 she promised she would never leave me. She told me a few weeks ago she was struggling and didn\u2019t want to be here but she wouldn\u2019t leave me. She was my best friend and we used to do everything together.\u201d Jill, also called Jill Parton, lived in Heaton Chapel and was well known from her time as landlady of The Crown pub near Stockport Viaduct. The big-hearted mum allowed more than 50 homeless and vulnerable people to stay at her home over the years until they got back on their feet. She was a huge animal lover and was often seen feeding squirrels at her local park - she even once owned two rescue ducks. \u201cShe was a lovely woman who would do anything for anyone,\u201d Amber continued, breaking into tears. \u201cShe was bubbly and happy. Anyone who was homeless or with nowhere to stay, she would let them stay with us. She would give her last \u00a310 to help anyone out. \u201cEveryone is writing on Facebook how she took them in when they were kicked out or struggling and had nowhere to go.\u201d Amber says she is currently staying in a hotel as she can\u2019t face going back to her family home. \u201cI\u2019d rather go out with my mum than my friends,\u201d she added. \u201cAnyone I\u2019d speak to would say it wasn\u2019t a normal mother-daughter relationship. \u201cWe used to tell each other everything. Everyone was jealous of our friendship. She never judged me. \u201cI\u2019ve been staying in a hotel because I can\u2019t be in the house thinking she\u2019s in the next room. She had been going through a lot of different things and had been through a lot throughout her life. She just wanted to be happy.\u201d A British Transport Police spokesperson confirmed Jill\u2019s death is not being treated as suspicious and a file is being prepared for the coroner. Amber is now making arrangements for her mum\u2019s funeral. She plans to scatter her ashes with Jill\u2019s late 19-year-old dog Benson at her request. She also hopes to attend university this year \u2013 something the mum and daughter duo had hoped to do together \u2013 to study business studies. The pair had dreams of owning their own pub and turning it into a franchise. \u201cI\u2019m going to make sure I finish it for her,\u201d Amber added. The devastated daughter has since set up a Gofundme appeal to help give her mum 'the best send off'. It reads: \u201cThis beautiful woman is my mum, Jill Parton but most of you know her as Jill Canovan. My mum was the kindest person with a heart of gold that lit up every room she walked into. \u201cShe would stop at nothing to help everyone. My mum was my world and anyone that knows us knows we didn\u2019t have just a mother daughter relationship, she was my best friend. \u201cI\u2019ve set up this Gofundme to help cover the funeral costs and give her the best send off possible. I know how loved she was, I just wish she knew it too. So please help me raise some money to say thank you.\u201d Don't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "summary": "Former pub landlady Jill Canovan was discovered near a railway station on Monday - her daughter said she would &quot;do anything for anyone&quot;.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/she-promised-would-never-leave-32992604", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32992646.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Jill.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:08:15", "author": "Jolene Campbell,Paige Oldfield", "authors": ["Jolene Campbell", "Paige Oldfield"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.358}

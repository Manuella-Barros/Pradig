{"id": 224056964, "title": "The Guardian view on discord in the arts world: a distraction from the real crisis", "text": "July\u2019s election has sent Britain into a spin, but for Mary Archer, charged with reporting on the fitness for purpose of Arts Council England (ACE), it is particularly tricky. For that is the month when her report was expected to be delivered to ministers, in preparation for publication in the autumn. All public bodies are rightly road-tested every few years to ensure that they are giving value for public money. But the remit for Dame Mary \u2013 a scientist and the wife of the former Tory party deputy chair Jeffrey Archer \u2013 is more than usually political. Arts funding has collapsed under the Conservatives, who have also pursued culture wars. Her report comes at a moment of profound dissonance, nearly halfway through Let\u2019s Create, a 10-year ACE plan to spread the arts more widely, and 18 months into a funding term which attempted to put that plan into action while also complying with a government instruction to cut spending in London by \u00a324m. Lobbying on all sides has been intense. The Arts Council was set up as an arm\u2019s-length organisation, funded by government but with the power to determine its own strategy. Questions have been raised as to whether it has been pursuing the right course, with some critics suggesting that it has prioritised wider representation over artistic excellence, while others complain that its systems are too ponderous to offer the support they need at a time when, through no fault of their own, they have been lurching from one crisis to another. The classical music sector feels particularly aggrieved, rallying behind its highest-profile casualty, English National Opera, which \u2013 after a period of hard bargaining \u2013 will for the next five years lead a dual life between its old London home, the Coliseum, and Manchester. The deep fears among classical musicians that \u201cnobody is listening to us\u201d at a time of exceptional hardship were articulated last year by John Gilhooly, chairman of the Royal Philharmonic Society, who suggested that ACE should recognise that \u201cfor the entire nation to prosper we need London to prosper\u201d, and that it should adapt its levelling up strategy \u201cto embrace this new landscape\u201d. In the other camp, an open letter to Dame Mary last week, signed by 249 arts leaders representing 220 organisations around the country \u2013 including many from London \u2013 made a case broadly in favour of the current policy, while voicing their own fears of a \u201cconcerted effort\u201d in some quarters to give the impression that the arts world was in open revolt against ACE. The anxiety on both sides is understandable. But the reality is that they are all scrapping over crumbs when the real betrayal is the state\u2019s paltry investment in the arts. This includes the music education that would provide new audiences for orchestras and opera companies. Even ACE\u2019s staunchest supporters agree that there is room for improvement in some of its communication systems, but its new crop of client organisations need time to demonstrate that excellence comes in many forms. It would be a disaster for everyone if the foundational principle of arm\u2019s-length funding, free from political whim and the short-termism of the political cycle, was undercut. The timing of Dame Mary\u2019s report \u2013 commissioned in one era and delivered in another \u2013 makes this point very starkly. The hope must be that it lands in a more enlightened political landscape.", "summary": "<p>Scrapping over the way money is distributed is no answer to the problems created by a decade of underfunding</p><p>July\u2019s election has sent Britain into a spin, but for Mary Archer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/mar/15/mary-archer-review-of-arts-council-england-to-look-at-project-quality-and-how-to-cut-costs\">charged with reporting</a> on the fitness for purpose of Arts Council England (ACE), it is particularly tricky.

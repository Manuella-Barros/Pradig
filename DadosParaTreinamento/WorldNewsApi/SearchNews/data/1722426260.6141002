The three animals were left to bleed out near the site at Thornton Hall in North Dublin but they did not die outright and were later put down by a vet. Gardai confirmed they are investigating the incident which took place last Wednesday evening. Similar incidents have occurred in the UK and Europe and are used to prevent people of the Islamic faith from an area as they consider pigs unclean.

It\u2019s not being reported but this has been escalating for weeks with numerous incidents of trespassing and criminal damage and nothing has been done about it.\u201d It is understood that Thornton Hall, which was originally the site of a proposed \u201csuper prison\u201d will be the first of the State's first major migrant camps. It is believed that up to 1,000 migrants and asylum seekers will be accommodated there in the coming weeks. Taoiseach Simon Harris is on record as saying that using Thornton Hall would be \u201clogical\u201d and \u201cthe best thing to do is to secure some state land\u201d. But residents near Thornton Hall have said they received \u201cno public consultation\u201d ahead of plans to bring asylum seekers to the area.They point out that there are no services that would help asylum seekers living there with one resident saying there is nothing there but a few sheds and a septic tank. There have been a number of protests by local people in recent weeks which were monitored by gardai. Yesterday gardai confirmed that the incident involving the pigs took place during the week. A garda spokesman stated: \u201cGarda\u00ed were called out to a premises in Killsallaghan, Co. Dublin on Wednesday evening, 26th June 2024 at approximately 5.30pm. \u201cTwo animals discovered at the location with injuries were attended to by a vet and subsequently euthanised. A third animal was taken into care. Shortly afterwards, a man (30s) was arrested and detained at a North Dublin Garda Station for an alleged offence under the Criminal Justice, Public Order Act, 1994. \u201cHe has since been charged and will appear before Swords District Court on Tuesday, 16th July 2024. Investigations are ongoing.\u201cAn Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na would appeal to any person with any information on this incident to contact investigating Garda\u00ed at Swords Garda station 01-6664700 or the Garda Confidential Phone number 1800 666 111.\u201d Join the Irish Mirror\u2019s breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

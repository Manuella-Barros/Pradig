As the technology continues to improve, Musk speculated about a world where humans do not have to work, according to the New York Post. Musk made a remote appearance at the Viva Technology conference in Paris on Thursday. He was asked about his job being replaced by AI, and what his thoughts were about what he would do if that were to happen. 'The question will really be one of meaning, of how \u2014 if a computer can do, and the robots can do everything better than you \u2026 does your life have meaning.' The Tesla CEO said: \u201cIn a benign scenario, probably none of us will have a job.\" \u201cThere will be universal high income \u2014 and not universal basic income \u2014 universal high income. There\u2019ll be no shortage of goods or services,\" per Fox News Digital. Musk went on to say that he estimated there was an 80% chance that all human work would be replaced by AI in the future. \u201cThe question will really be one of meaning, of how \u2014 if a computer can do, and the robots can do everything better than you \u2026 does your life have meaning?\u201d Musk said. \u201cThat really will be the question in that benign scenario, and in the negative scenario, all bets are off where we\u2019re in deep trouble.\u201d Despite these worries, Musk predicted that AI will eventually take over all the jobs that humans currently do. However, this raises questions about how quickly AI can progress in order to bring this about. \u201cI think we are seeing the most disruptive force in history here,\u201d Musk said about AI during a discussion with UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak last fall. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say exactly what that moment is, but there will come a point where no job is needed,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can have a job if you want to have a job \u2014 sort of personal satisfaction \u2014 but the AI will be able to do everything.\u201d Though the tech mogul has high hopes for the future, it does not appear AI is anywhere close to taking over all human jobs. Musk did not provide a time table for when the AI might take over. Like Blaze News? Bypass the censors, sign up for our newsletters, and get stories like this direct to your inbox.

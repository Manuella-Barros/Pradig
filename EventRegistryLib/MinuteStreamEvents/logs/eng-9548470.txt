'Market Economy' Status", "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's bid to draw Vietnam closer as a strategic ally will clash head-on with his desire for union workers' votes on Wednesday as the Commerce Department hears testimony on whether to designate Vietnam as a \"market economy\".\n\nThe move, opposed by U.S. steelmakers and Gulf Coast shrimpers but backed by retailers and other business groups, would reduce the punitive anti-dumping duties set on Vietnamese imports because of its current status as a non-market economy with heavy state influence.\n\n\"Vietnam is already a market economy,\" said Ted Osius, head of the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council, which backs the upgrade. \"It has met key criteria such as currency convertibility and is ready for an accurate designation.\"\n\nThe Commerce Department will hear arguments from both sides during a virtual hearing on Wednesday afternoon in Washington as part of a review due to be completed in late July.\n\nVietnam has argued to be freed of the non-market label because of recent economic reforms, saying retaining the moniker is bad for increasingly close two-way ties that Washington sees as a counterbalance to China.\n\nDuring Biden's visit to Hanoi last year, the two countries elevated ties to a \"comprehensive strategic partnership\", lifting Washington's diplomatic status in Vietnam to match China and Russia.\n\nLast year, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh also urged U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen for an end to the non-market label, befitting Vietnam's status as a U.S. \"friend-shoring\" destination to diversify supply chains away from China.\n\nThe current designation lumps Vietnam in with China, Russia, Belarus, Azerbaijan an nine other countries as non-market economies subject to higher anti-dumping duties.\n\n\"American businesses are already investing significantly in Vietnam as they recognize its growth potential,\" said Osius, a former U.S. ambassador to Vietnam.\n\nThe Commerce Department has a fairly narrow set of criteria for determining market economy status.\n\nThese include the extent to which the country's currency is convertible; its wage rates are a result of free bargaining between labor and management, and permission for joint ventures or other foreign investment.\n\nFurther criteria include whether the government owns or controls the means of production and the government controls the allocation of resources and price and output decisions.\n\nGoods from non-market economies are subject to higher tariff rates in anti-dumping duty investigations that use third-country proxy prices to determine a product's fair market value.\n\nThis year, the U.S. International Trade Commission renewed anti-dumping duties of 25.76% on frozen farmed shrimp from Vietnam, but duties on shrimp from Thailand, a market economy, are only 5.34%.\n\nThe Southern Shrimp Alliance of U.S. shrimp fishermen and processors said it opposed the grant of market economy status because of Vietnam's bars on land ownership, its weak labor laws and lower shrimp duties that would hurt its members.\n\nUpgrading Vietnam's status also faces significant opposition in Congress, with eight U.S. senators and 31 members of the House of Representatives making similar arguments to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.\n\nThey have urged her to also consider that the move would aid Chinese state firms that have invested heavily in Vietnam, by letting them more easily circumvent U.S. tariffs on their goods.\n\nRoy Houseman, legislative director of the United Steelworkers Union (USW), added that the change would \"erode our domestic manufacturing base, undermine U.S. supply chain resiliency and reinforce Vietnam's role as a conduit for an influx of unfairly traded Chinese goods.\"\n\nBiden has heavily courted union votes in the looming November presidential election, particularly from steelworkers in the key swing state of Pennsylvania.\n\nHe has opposed Nippon Steel's proposed takeover of Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel, and called for sharply higher \"Section 301\" tariffs on imports of Chinese steel.\n\n(Reporting by David Lawder and David

"body": "\"Vietnam is already a market economy,\" said Ted Osius, head of the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council, which backs the upgrade. \"It has met key criteria such as currency convertibility and is ready for an accurate designation.\"\n\nThe Commerce Department will hear arguments from both sides during a virtual hearing on Wednesday afternoon in Washington as part of a review due to be completed in late July.\n\nVietnam has argued to be freed of the non-market label because of recent economic reforms, saying retaining the moniker is bad for increasingly close two-way ties that Washington sees as a counterbalance to China.\n\nDuring Biden's visit to Hanoi last year, the two countries elevated ties to a \"comprehensive strategic partnership\", lifting Washington's diplomatic status in Vietnam to match China and Russia.\n\nLast year, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh also urged U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen for an end to the non-market label, befitting Vietnam's status as a U.S. \"friend-shoring\" destination to diversify supply chains away from China.\n\nThe current designation lumps Vietnam in with China, Russia, Belarus, Azerbaijan an nine other countries as non-market economies subject to higher anti-dumping duties.\n\n\"American businesses are already investing significantly in Vietnam as they recognize its growth potential,\" said Osius, a former U.S. ambassador to Vietnam.\n\nThe Commerce Department has a fairly narrow set of criteria for determining market economy status.\n\nThese include the extent to which the country's currency is convertible; its wage rates are a result of free bargaining between labor and management, and permission for joint ventures or other foreign investment.\n\nFurther criteria include whether the government owns or controls the means of production and the government controls the allocation of resources and price and output decisions.\n\nGoods from non-market economies are subject to higher tariff rates in anti-dumping duty investigations that use third-country proxy prices to determine a product's fair market value.\n\nThis year, the U.S. International Trade Commission renewed anti-dumping duties of 25.76% on frozen farmed shrimp from Vietnam, but duties on shrimp from Thailand, a market economy, are only 5.34%.\n\nThe Southern Shrimp Alliance of U.S. shrimp fishermen and processors said it opposed the grant of market economy status because of Vietnam's bars on land ownership, its weak labor laws and lower shrimp duties that would hurt its members.\n\nUpgrading Vietnam's status also faces significant opposition in Congress, with eight U.S. senators and 31 members of the House of Representatives making similar arguments to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.\n\nThey have urged her to also consider that the move would aid Chinese state firms that have invested heavily in Vietnam, by letting them more easily circumvent U.S. tariffs on their goods.\n\nRoy Houseman, legislative director of the United Steelworkers Union (USW), added that the change would \"erode our domestic manufacturing base, undermine U.S. supply chain resiliency and reinforce Vietnam's role as a conduit for an influx of unfairly traded Chinese goods.\"\n\nBiden has heavily courted union votes in the looming November presidential election, particularly from steelworkers in the key swing state of Pennsylvania.\n\nHe has opposed Nippon Steel's proposed takeover of Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel, and called for sharply higher \"Section 301\" tariffs on imports of Chinese steel.\n\n(Reporting by David Lawder and David Brunnstrom; Writing by David Lawder; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title":

economy\" status", "body": "WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden's bid to draw Vietnam closer as a strategic ally will clash head-on with his desire for union workers' votes on Wednesday as the Commerce Department hears testimony on whether to designate Vietnam as a \"market economy\".\n\nThe move, opposed by US steelmakers and Gulf Coast shrimpers but backed by retailers and other business groups, would reduce the punitive anti-dumping duties set on Vietnamese imports because of its current status as a non-market economy with heavy state influence.\n\n\"Vietnam is already a market economy,\" said Ted Osius, head of the US-Asean Business Council, which backs the upgrade. \"It has met key criteria such as currency convertibility and is ready for an accurate designation.\"\n\nThe Commerce Department will hear arguments from both sides during a virtual hearing on Wednesday afternoon in Washington as part of a review due to be completed in late July.\n\nVietnam has argued to be freed of the non-market label because of recent economic reforms, saying retaining the moniker is bad for increasingly close two-way ties that Washington sees as a counterbalance to China.\n\nDuring Biden's visit to Hanoi last year, the two countries elevated ties to a \"comprehensive strategic partnership\", lifting Washington's diplomatic status in Vietnam to match China and Russia.\n\nLast year, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh also urged US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen for an end to the non-market label, befitting Vietnam's status as a US \"friend-shoring\" destination to diversify supply chains away from China.\n\nThe current designation lumps Vietnam in with China, Russia, Belarus, Azerbaijan and nine other countries as non-market economies subject to higher anti-dumping duties.\n\n\"American businesses are already investing significantly in Vietnam as they recognise its growth potential,\" said Osius, a former US ambassador to Vietnam.\n\nThe Commerce Department has a fairly narrow set of criteria for determining market economy status.\n\nThese include the extent to which the country's currency is convertible; its wage rates are a result of free bargaining between labour and management, and permission for joint ventures or other foreign investment.\n\nFurther criteria include whether the government owns or controls the means of production and the government controls the allocation of resources and price and output decisions.\n\nGoods from non-market economies are subject to higher tariff rates in anti-dumping duty investigations that use third-country proxy prices to determine a product's fair market value.\n\nThis year, the US International Trade Commission renewed anti-dumping duties of 25.76% on frozen farmed shrimp from Vietnam, but duties on shrimp from Thailand, a market economy, are only 5.34%.\n\nThe Southern Shrimp Alliance of US shrimp fishermen and processors said it opposed the grant of market economy status because of Vietnam's bars on land ownership, its weak labor laws and lower shrimp duties that would hurt its members.\n\nUpgrading Vietnam's status also faces significant opposition in Congress, with eight US senators and 31 members of the House of Representatives making similar arguments to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.\n\nThey have urged her to also consider that the move would aid Chinese state firms that have invested heavily in Vietnam, by letting them more easily circumvent US tariffs on their goods.\n\nRoy Houseman, legislative director of the United Steelworkers Union (USW), added that the change would \"erode our domestic manufacturing base, undermine US supply chain resiliency and reinforce Vietnam's role as a conduit for an influx of unfairly traded Chinese goods.\"\n\nBiden has heavily courted union votes in the looming November presidential election, particularly from steelworkers in the key swing state of Pennsylvania.", "source": {"uri": "bangkokpost.com", "dataType":

US anti-dumping duties on Vietnamese frozen farmed shrimp are currently 25.76 per cent, while similar duties on shrimp from Thailand, a market economy, are only 5.34 per cent.\n\nAssertions of Vietnam's lawyers that rising Vietnamese wages are the result of labour-management bargaining also came under challenge.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said that Vietnam did not meet basic labour rights standards that are required for reclassification and that it was false to say that Vietnamese workers can organise unions or that their wages are the result of free bargaining.\n\n\"Vietnam's Trade Union Law only allows government-controlled 'unions',\" it said in a statement after the hearing.\n\nNazak Nikakhtar, a former Commerce Department official in the Trump administration now with the Wiley Rein law firm, said Hanoi employed the same oppressive policies and predatory economic practices as China and was likely to side with its powerful next-door neighbour over the US.\n\nEmerson, the lawyer representing Hanoi, said denial of market economy status would push Vietnam closer to China.

Vietnam's deepening economic ties to China loomed large in arguments on both sides of the issue at a virtual public hearing hosted by the Commerce Department as part of a review and decision due on July 26.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden's bid to draw Vietnam closer as a strategic ally clashed with his desire for union workers' votes on Wednesday as trade lawyers sparred over whether the Commerce Department should upgrade the communist-ruled country to market economy status. The move, opposed by U.S. steelmakers, Gulf Coast shrimpers and American honey farmers, but backed by retailers and some other business groups, would reduce the punitive anti-dumping duties set on Vietnamese imports because of its current status as a non-market economy marked by heavy state influence.\n\nVietnam's deepening economic ties to China loomed large in arguments on both sides of the issue at a virtual public hearing hosted by the Commerce Department as part of a review and decision due on July 26. Steptoe LLP attorney Eric Emerson, representing Vietnam's Ministry of Industry and Trade, said Vietnam should be graduated to market economy status because it has satisfied the six criteria used by the Commerce Department to judge whether countries have a market-driven economy, from currency convertibility and labor rights to investment openness and resource allocation.\n\n\"Vietnam has demonstrated that its performance on these statutory factors is as good, or often better, than other countries that have previously been granted market economy status,\" he said, citing less government support for state firms than India and more openness to foreign investment than Indonesia, Canada and the Philippines. Vietnam has argued it should be freed of the non-market label because of recent economic reforms, saying retaining the moniker is bad for increasingly close two-way ties that Washington sees as a counterbalance to China.\n\nDuring Biden's visit to Hanoi last year, the two countries elevated ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has promoted Vietnam as a \"friend-shoring\" destination to shift U.S. supply chains away from China. Upgrade proponent Samsung Electronics has become one of the biggest employers in Vietnam because of the country's market-oriented changes, the South Korean firm's U.S public policy head Scott Thompson told the hearing.\n\n\"Vietnam has emerged as a stable, secure supply chain partner of the United States ... to the ultimate benefit of the U.S. economy,\" Thompson said. CHINESE INFLUENCE\n\nBut opponents of upgrading Vietnam - one of 12 economies labeled by Washington as non-market, including China, Russia, North Korea and Azerbaijan - argued that Hanoi's policy commitments have not been matched by concrete actions and it operates as a planned economy governed by the ruling Communist Party. They also said Vietnam's industries are highly dependent on investment and imports of inputs from China, many of which are already subject to U.S. anti-dumping duties.\n\nJeffrey Gerrish, a former Trump administration trade official representing Steel Dynamics Inc, said upgrading would unleash a flood of unfairly traded imports from Vietnam, which he said had become a platform for circumvention of U.S. tariffs by China. \"Rather than countering Chinese influence, any such action would serve as a gift to China and Chinese interests,\" Gerrish said.\n\nBiden has heavily courted union votes in the looming November presidential election, particularly from steelworkers in the swing state of Pennsylvania. He has opposed Nippon Steel's proposed takeover of Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel, and called for sharply higher Section 301 tariffs on imports of Chinese steel.\n\nTARIFF CUT At the heart of the Commerce decision is whether to continue the higher tariff rates on Vietnamese goods in anti-dumping cases involving non-market economies. U.S. anti-dumping duties on Vietnamese frozen farmed shrimp are currently 25.76%, while similar duties on shrimp from Thailand, a market economy, are only 5.34%.\n\nAssertions of Vietnam's lawyers that rising Vietnamese wages are the result of labor-management bargaining also came under challenge. Human Rights Watch said Vietnam did not meet basic labor rights standards required for reclassification and that it was false to say that Vietnamese workers can organize unions or that their wages are the result of free bargaining.\n\n\"Vietnam's Trade Union Law only allows government-controlled 'unions,'\" it said in a statement after the hearing. Nazak Nikakhtar, a former Commerce Department official in the Trump administration now with the Wiley Rein law firm, said Hanoi employed the same oppressive policies and predatory economic practices as China and was likely to side with its powerful next-door neighbor over the U.S.\n\nEmerson, the lawyer representing Hanoi, said denial of market economy status would push Vietnam closer to China.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"},

In total, the list includes 12 non-market economies such as Russia, China, and some countries which used to be a part of the erstwhile Soviet Union.\n\nThe US designates a country as a non-market economy based on several factors. These are: if the country's currency is convertible; if wage rates are determined by free bargaining between labour and management; if joint ventures or other foreign investment are allowed; whether the means of production are owned by the state; and if the state controls the allocation of resources and price and output decisions. Other factors like human rights are also considered.\n\nThe non-market economy label allows the US to impose \"anti-dumping\" duties on goods imported from designated countries. In international trade, dumping is when a country's export prices are considered to be intentionally set below domestic prices, thereby inflicting harm to industries in the importing country. Anti-dumping duties essentially compensate for the difference between the imported good's export price and their normal value.\n\nThe level of anti-dumping duties is determined by relying on a third country, for instance, Bangladesh, which is a market economy. The US assesses the value of a product to be imported from a non-market economy like Vietnam based on what it is worth in Bangladesh and then assumes that this is the supposed production cost to a Vietnamese company. The company's own data about the costs are not considered.\n\nWhy does Vietnam want to get the 'market economy' status?\n\nVietnam has argued that in recent years it has implemented enough economic reforms that should get its name off the non-market economies list. The country does meet a number of criteria for the status to be changed. For instance, Vietnam allows foreign investment, wages are determined by free negotiations between workers and management, and most of the means of production are not owned by the state, according to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\n\nThe change in status will also help Vietnam get rid of the anti-dumping duties, making its products more competitive in the US market. Vietnam's Center for WTO and International Trade has said that the method of calculating anti-dumping duties is flawed as it causes \"the dumping margin to be pushed up very high\" and does not actually reflect the situation of Vietnamese companies, according to a report by DW.\n\nWhat are the challenges?\n\nThe road to Vietnam getting the market economy tag is dotted with roadblocks. The US steelmakers and the American Shrimp Processors Association have asked the Biden administration to not change Vietnam's status. The association has cited Vietnam's restrictions on land ownership, the country's weak labour laws, and lower shrimp duties that would hurt its members, to make its case.\n\nThe move could also see opposition in Congress, where eight US senators and 31 members of the House of Representatives claim that the change in Vietnam's status \"would aid Chinese state firms that have invested heavily in Vietnam, by letting them more easily circumvent US tariffs on their goods,\" according to a report by Reuters.\n\nCurrently, the US Commerce Department is in the midst of reviewing -- the process began last year -- Vietnam's status. The review is set to end by late July.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alind_chauhan@indianexpress.com", "name": "Alind Chauhan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumping_(pricing_policy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dumping (pricing policy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Means of production"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign direct investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinese economic reform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Strategic_and_International_Studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Center for Strategic and International Studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Welle", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Welle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Trade Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Associations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/Vietnam.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548470", "eventUri": "eng-9548470", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Doing so would be a mistake.\n\nThe Commerce Department held a hearing on Wednesday as part of an ongoing review of whether Vietnam should be granted \"market economy\" status, a move that would reduce tariffs placed on imports from the Southeast Asian nation.\n\nThe review began in October 2023, and the Commerce Department is expected to announce a decision by mid-July. Vietnamese officials are pushing hard for the change, arguing it will help the communist nation avoid severe anti-dumping duties currently in place that modulate its exports to the United States. The National Retail Federation also is supportive, likely because it would make imports from Vietnam even cheaper.\n\nBut there's a big catch: Vietnam doesn't actually meet the criteria for non-market economy status.\n\nThere are six factors that the Commerce Department is required to consider when granting market status. Vietnam's case for meeting those requirements is flimsy. As the Alliance for American Manufacturing wrote to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo back in December, Vietnam is a socialist republic with a one-party system led by the Communist Party of Vietnam.\n\nIn the letter, we cited several specific reasons why Vietnam cannot be understood to demonstrate the characteristics of a market economy, including:\n\nAnd lastly, graduating Vietnam to a market economy status would jeopardize U.S. economic and national security interests. The Vietnamese government is formally connected to China politically, defensively, and economically -- and there's evidence China is using Vietnam is a hub for circumvention of U.S. laws like the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and various trade enforcement mechanisms.\n\nAAM isn't alone in opposing granting Vietnam market economy status. A slew of American manufacturers and the United Steelworkers (USW) union also have opposed any change to Vietnam's market economy status, as a modification of Vietnam's non-market economy designation would weaken trade remedies for U.S. industries confronted by unfair trade. The Southern Shrimp Alliance, not a group that typically weighs in on the kind of trade matters we care about, also has publicly opposed the change.\n\nAmerica's steelworkers are all too familiar with China's practice of dumping its steel products into the U.S. via a third-party country. Many of China's government-owned companies are heavily invested in Vietnam and already have been shipping products into the U.S. via Vietnam; they likely would benefit even further from Vietnam's change to a market economy -- at the expense of American workers and manufacturers.\n\nRoy Houseman, legislative director of the USW, said that the change would \"erode our domestic manufacturing base, undermine U.S. supply chain resiliency and reinforce Vietnam's role as a conduit for an influx of unfairly traded Chinese goods.\"\n\nMembers of Congress, both in the House and Senate, have echoed these same sentiments in their own letters to Raimondo, arguing that Chinese-backed companies in Vietnam would certainly take advantage of the change by more easily avoiding U.S. tariffs.\n\n\"We must not reinforce Vietnam's position as a vector for a flood of unfairly traded Chinese goods circumventing existing trade measures and Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) rules against forced labor by China,\" AAM wrote in our letter to Raimondo. \"Any wishful benefits for U.S. foreign policy are far outweighed by the very real economic costs that would be incurred, including significant loss of U.S. jobs nationwide while undermining U.S. supply chain resiliency.\"", "source": {"uri": "americanmanufacturing.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alliance for

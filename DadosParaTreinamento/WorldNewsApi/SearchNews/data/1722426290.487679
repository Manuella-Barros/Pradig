In the Disney+ drama, set in a Chicago kitchen seething with flames and dripping with sweat, he plays Richie, the \u201ccousin\u201d of head chef Carmy (Jeremy Allen White). The yell of \u201cCousin!!!\u201d has become synonymous with Moss-Bachrach\u2019s character, a nickname bellowed over sizzling scallops and perfect plum gel\u00e9es. Richie is a guy who works his shifts with veins popping out of his neck, eyebrows knotted in frustration; everything\u2019s top volume, no filter. But the actor himself is a marked contrast from this: gentle, quick to laugh, and selective about what he says. \u201cFortunately for my wife and my children, I\u2019m not much of a vein-popper,\u201d he says with a chuckle. \u201cPlaying Richie gives me a nice opportunity to blow off some steam, and live in a way that\u2019s outside of polite society. In my personal life, I\u2019m much more concerned about taking care of the people around me.\u201d The 47-year-old character actor, who\u2019s also had turns in TV hits from legal series Damages and millennial drama Girls to Elizabeth Holmes biopic The Dropout, is speaking over the phone from his home in Brooklyn. He is even more softly spoken than usual; some of the pollen sweeping through the city has lodged itself in the back of his throat. Rasping his way through our conversation, he switches between throat-clearing and apologies. His camera is off, so I can\u2019t see his icicle-blue eyes, but he tells me he\u2019s chatting from his bedroom. \u201cThere are paintings, books, a bunch of clothes on the chair\u2026 you\u2019re dodging a bullet from seeing the state of it.\u201d There\u2019s likely an Emmy nestled in there somewhere, too. Moss-Bachrach won his first earlier this year for playing Richie, on a night that saw The Bear gobble up six awards. By the time the show won the Outstanding Comedy Series prize towards the end of the ceremony, Moss-Bachrach was so excited that, during co-star Matty Matheson\u2019s speech on stage, he grabbed him by the cheeks and planted a passionate, eight-second kiss on his lips. Moss-Bachrach remembers the moment fondly. \u201cHe\u2019s a dear friend and, I mean, you know what he looks like \u2013 he\u2019s just got this incredibly kissable face. And he\u2019s also really digressive, he can go on and on. So he took a breath and I seized my moment and just followed my heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a beautiful night for us. I don\u2019t put a lot of stakes in these awards, but those kinds of pure, emotional celebrations are rare.\u201d Few people could have predicted that a shouty \u2013 and honestly quite stressful \u2013 series, set in a failing sandwich restaurant, with a cast of relative unknowns, would be such a hit. But critics adored it. Five-star reviews flew in for its first season in 2022, with The Independent calling it \u201celectrifying\u201d. Viewers loved it, too. They have become particularly obsessed with Allen White, who has been heralded as the internet\u2019s \u201chot rodent boyfriend\u201d for his apparent resemblance to Remy from Ratatouille. But Moss-Bachrach \u2013 more feline than rodent \u2013 is the real scene-stealer. Richie is bold and brash, but he also has a boyish naivety and a longing for belonging \u2013 Moss-Bachrach nails the balance. And he hops comfortably between Richie\u2019s states of frenetic energy and occasional moments of serenity. Season two saw the restaurant at the show\u2019s centre, The Beef, transition into a fine-dining establishment named The Bear. One beautiful episode, \u201cForks\u201d, zoned in on Richie\u2019s graduation from sweatpants to suits; a quiet scene of him peeling mushrooms with Olivia Colman\u2019s famous chef was strangely piercing. When we rejoin the gang in season three, that atmosphere of calm has evaporated, and Richie and Carmy are straight into a slinging match of \u201cf*** you\u201d, \u201cget f***ed\u201d and other variations on that theme. Carmy\u2019s new guidelines for The Bear are, according to Richie, \u201cf***ing demented\u201d. In the middle of the warring pair, trying to keep the peace, is Carmy\u2019s right-hand woman Sydney (Ayo Edebiri). Shooting the series is intense. \u201cThe level of trust that you have to have with your scene partners is a lot,\u201d says Moss-Bachrach. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really thrilling. Even before we get to any emotional vulnerability, there\u2019s the physical world of knives, very sharp knives that people are cutting with, and live flames and boiling water. You gotta trust that Ayo is not actually gonna stick the knife in me.\u201d While Moss-Bachrach has a different temperament to Richie, they share the same values. Richie has a daughter who\u2019s about 10; Moss-Bachrach has two teenage daughters with his wife, the Ukrainian photographer Yelena Yemchuk. \u201cNot to toot my own horn, but that is common ground for me and Richie, a devotion to our children,\u201d he says. In \u201cForks\u201d, Richie learns to love Taylor Swift because his daughter\u2019s a dedicated Swiftie. Has he ever met the superstar? \u201cNo, never. She sounds lovely. Those friendship bracelets her fans wear are very cute.\u201d That\u2019s all he says on the matter of Swift \u2013 and he\u2019s not keen to talk about her potential impact on the US election, either, or a certain Republican hopeful. \u201cI don\u2019t really like to talk about him,\u201d he says. He does add, though, that the idea of Americans emigrating to avoid Donald Trump doesn\u2019t make sense to him. \u201cWith the irresponsible climate policies all around the world, there\u2019s nowhere you can really go. Leaving the country is sort of like sticking a finger in a faulty dam.\u201d The actor is more open to discussing a bug-bear for both him and Richie: gentrification. In The Bear, Richie is heartbroken to watch Chicago changing around him. Moss-Bachrach feels the same about New York. \u201cI live in a city that reinvents itself every minute,\u201d he says. \u201cI mourn all the stuff that goes. I like old things \u2013 I like old neon signs and restaurants that have been around for a long time.\u201d Like Richie, he resents the influx of \u201cmillennial, business-school chains, which are antiseptic, devoid of humanity, and completely soulless\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m totally with him,\u201d Moss-Bachrach says. \u201cI understand that things are gonna come and go, this is the nature of life, but I do think this idea of what we call progress could use a little bit more scrutiny.\u201d Nor is he a huge fan of fine dining. \u201cI\u2019m not a big Michelin guy,\u201d he says, admitting that he\u2019d rather not spend hours sitting through a seven-course tasting menu. \u201cI get antsy. I get restaurant anxiety after like two hours. I gotta go.\u201d Born in New York but raised in rural Massachusetts, Moss-Bachrach describes his childhood as \u201cbucolic\u201d, \u201csweet\u201d, and full of books. His dad founded a community music school and his mum worked for the youth mentoring initiative Big Brothers Big Sisters. He spent his time getting lost in make-believe games in the woods, riding his bike, and playing piano. He and his friends formed a jazz band as teenagers. \u201cThe energy and excitement I got from that is what brought me to doing plays and making TV shows and movies,\u201d he says. While studying English and Music at Columbia University, he took an acting class out of curiosity. By the time he graduated, he had an agent. He has worked consistently since and prides himself on never being typecast \u2013 \u201cthe coolest thing that I\u2019ve accomplished is not getting stuck in playing one sort of person for a long time\u2026 I have a restless soul\u201d. His was an auspicious start. His first play was When They Speak of Rita, directed by Pulitzer winner Horton Foote. His first screen role was the 1999 thriller film Murder in a Small Town, alongside Hollywood legend Gene Wilder. A couple of years later came a bit part as \u201cFrederick the Bellboy\u201d in Wes Anderson\u2019s 2001 film The Royal Tenenbaums, and a role as the cousin of Kirsten Dunst in Mona Lisa Smile (2003), before his real breakthrough arrived in 2014, when he was 37, in Lena Dunham\u2019s seminal study of millennial New York life, Girls. The series, which ran for six seasons from 2012 to 2017, was trailblazing in its warts-and-all depiction of womanhood. It showed women working in post-recession America, women wrestling with OCD, talking about abortion, experiencing consent issues and sexual assault, falling in love, and forging \u2013 and breaking \u2013 friendships. Even in Moss-Bachrach\u2019s character Desi, it was ahead of its time in depicting a \u201cnice guy\u201d who actually turns out to be toxic and manipulative. But in more recent years, Girls has been condemned for \u201cwhitewashing New York\u201d, and Dunham has become a lightning rod for criticism over her comments on everything from race to body image. Does Moss-Bachrach have complicated feelings about Girls when he thinks back on it? He answers diplomatically. \u201cIt was an important show,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was so confessional and honest and ugly in a way that opened the door for so many others.\u201d He believes the landscape of narrative television \u201cwould not look like how it does\u201d without it. \u201cThat\u2019s what I think about when I think about Girls,\u201d he says, not wanting to dwell on the show\u2019s complex legacy. \u201cWhen I started acting, TV was a very boring place. This is oversimplified, but there was a paradigm of actors living in New York that were interested in doing theatre and independent films, and actors in LA who were financially successful and on TV. They were doing procedurals and medical shows and multi-camera sitcoms,\u201d he says. \u201cBut Girls really opened up people\u2019s minds. Like, oh, actually, we can make something interesting and personal and weird, and people will watch it.\u201d He had a lot of fun playing Desi, the disastrous boyfriend of Allison Williams\u2019s highly strung Marnie. In the show, the pair were also a musical duo, with painfully cringe lyrics such as \u201cyou\u2019ll find me in a dark bar, where no gringos are\u201d in the song \u201cOaxaca\u201d. Moss-Bachrach laughs at the memory. \u201cJack Antonoff [who was dating Dunham at the time] wrote some of those songs. I know obviously they were silly and meant as a joke, but I had a great time recording them. They\u2019re so guileless and earnest and I just think that we wind up so cynical so much of the time, and I get that, but it\u2019s nice to just put all that stuff away and just sing loud from the heart without being self-critical. It\u2019s nice to walk in those shoes for a while. I don\u2019t allow myself to live like that too much. I have a little critic whispering in my ear most of the time.\u201d In the years since playing Desi, however, he\u2019s started to see the character\u2019s darkness and duplicity more clearly. \u201cIt\u2019s convenient for people to be nice until things start not going their way. People can change a bit, you know?\u201d he says. \u201cDesi had a very considered armour, and he was a consciously put together and curated kind of man in a way that was almost menacing \u2013 disingenuous and mean and scary.\" Rewatching Girls recently, I was struck by how little Moss-Bachrach seems to have changed since then. He appears to be immune to ageing, like the forever-young-looking Paul Rudd. \u201cYeah, I subscribe to the Paul Rudd night-time moisturiser regime,\u201d the actor laughs. \u201cNo, but I do think a life in something that you love can keep you young.\u201d To prove his point, he tells a story about hanging out with then-septuagenarians Eileen Atkins and Vanessa Redgrave when he starred with them in the 2007 film Evening. \u201cEvery day, after work, we would all meet in the hotel restaurant and we\u2019d have a martini and smoke a cigarette,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was so fun to be around these two legends that were really just behaving like a couple of teenagers.\u201d Another key to his youth might be his frequent, bracing dips in the ocean, and the pilates he\u2019s started doing to prepare for his role as rock-solid superhero The Thing in Fantastic Four. \u201cI\u2019m taking baby steps into it and it makes me feel really good,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m like 6\u20191, and I touched my toes for the first time in my life two days ago.\u201d A breakthrough on Girls, an Emmy for The Bear, a role in Marvel, touching his toes\u2026 You can\u2019t say he\u2019s not versatile. \u2018The Bear\u2019 season three is out now on Disney", "summary": "<p>The versatile actor won an Emmy for his performance as Richie, the chief disruptor in hit chef drama \u2018The Bear\u2019.

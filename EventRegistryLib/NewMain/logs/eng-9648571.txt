They have only pride to play for and will be looking to bow out of the tournament on a high. Oman cannot have a better way to bow out of the competition than to dump the defending champions out as well.\n\nPhil Salt, Jos Buttler (c & wk), Will Jacks, Jonny Bairstow, Harry Brook, Liam Livingstone, Moeen Ali, Jofra Archer, Mark Wood, Adil Rashid, Reece Topley\n\nPratik Athavale (wk), Naseem Khushi, Aqib Ilyas (c), Zeeshan Maqsood, Ayaan Khan, Rafiullah, Mohammad Nadeem, Mehran Khan, Fayyaz Butt, Samay Shrivastava, Bilal Khan\n\nEngland:\n\nPhilip Salt, Jos Buttler(w/c), Will Jacks, Jonny Bairstow, Moeen Ali, Harry Brook, Liam Livingstone, Chris Jordan, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Mark Wood, Reece Topley, Ben Duckett, Sam Curran, Tom Hartley\n\nOman:\n\nPratik Athavale(w), Naseem Khushi, Aqib Ilyas(c), Zeeshan Maqsood, Khalid Kail, Ayaan Khan, Mehran Khan, Rafiullah, Shakeel Ahmed, Kaleemullah, Bilal Khan, Kashyap Prajapati, Mohammad Nadeem, Shoaib Khan, Fayyaz Butt\n\nEngland and Oman are yet to play a T20I against each other so far. In fact, the upcoming game is the first-ever international game between the two sides.\n\nThe onus will be on Jos Buttler to lead his side from the very front in the must-win clash. Buttler has a reputation of doing well with the bat in pressure situations and the England captain will be looking to score big against Oman. In the previous game against Australia, he had scored 42 runs off 28 balls.\n\nAyaan Khan:\n\nAyaan Khan has been Oman's best performer with the bat in the ongoing T20 World Cup. He has scored 92 runs in three games so far and will be looking to impress against England as well. In the previous game against Scotland, he scored an unbeaten 41 to help his side touch the 150-run mark.\n\nPhil Salt will be looking to score big against Oman after throwing away the start in the previous game against Australia. The hard-hitting opener scored 37 runs with the help of four fours and two sixes before being cleaned up by Adam Zampa. Salt had a stunning campaign in the IPL not very long ago and will be looking to deliver for his national team in the must-win clash.\n\nPratik Athavale:\n\nPratik Athavale will be high on confidence after his fine performance with the bat in the previous game against Scotland. The Oman opener scored 54 runs with the help of five fours and two sixes and will be looking to give his team a good start in the upcoming game as well.\n\nEngland will start the game as firm favourites and are expected to win the upcoming game against Oman.", "source": {"uri": "sportzwiki.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportzwiki"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They then suffered a 36-run defeat to Australia, leaving them with just one point from their two games. Now, England must win convincingly against both Oman and Namibia and hope that Australia defeats Scotland.\n\nEngland will come out all guns blazing in this encounter, and expect them to come out attacking both with the bat and ball. It will be interesting to see if England sticks with the same side as their first encounter or if will they make any changes to their lineup.\n\nOman (Team News)\n\nOman (OMN) have already been eliminated from the tournament after their third consecutive loss, this time to Scotland. With nothing left to play for, they will aim to spoil England's chances in their upcoming match.\n\nThey pose a threat if the pitch and conditions favor them in this encounter, they have it in them to topple a big team and this could very well be the game.\n\nThis will be the first occasion when these two teams will be facing each other.\n\nEngland Squad: Philip Salt, Jos Buttler(w/c), Will Jacks, Jonny Bairstow, Moeen Ali, Harry Brook, Liam Livingstone, Chris Jordan, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Mark Wood, Reece Topley, Ben Duckett, Sam Curran, Tom Hartley\n\nOman squad: Pratik Athavale(w), Naseem Khushi, Aqib Ilyas(c), Zeeshan Maqsood, Khalid Kail, Ayaan Khan, Mehran Khan, Rafiullah, Shakeel Ahmed, Kaleemullah, Bilal Khan, Kashyap Prajapati, Mohammad Nadeem, Shoaib Khan, Fayyaz Butt\n\nProbable Playing XI England: Jos Buttler (C), PD Salt, JM Bairstow, WG Jacks, HC Brook, MM Ali, LS Livingstone, CJ Jordan, AU Rashid, Jofra Archer, Mark Wood\n\nProbable Playing XI Oman: Pratik Athavale (wk), Naseem Khushi, Aqib Ilyas (C), Zeeshan Maqsood, Khalid Kail, Ayaan Khan, Mehran Khan, Shakeel Ahmed, Bilal Khan, Kaleemullah, Rafiullah M\n\nThe pitches will provide a lot of help for the bowlers and run-making will be difficult as the tournament has suggested so far.

If we get into a position where we're in a dominant position and can push hard, we will. If we have to scrap and fight and get the two points, we will as well. So, we'll just keep an open mind, as we always will. But essentially, we want to play that brand of cricket. I think we had glimpses of it the other day. I thought we started well with the bat, but to get a full performance in is really important. Get that on-field confidence. I think we're really close, but obviously it's been a bit of a disjointed tournament so far,\" said England Coach Matthew Mott\n\nEngland are set to play their first T20I match at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, even though they have previously competed at this ground on 13 occasions, including two recent appearances during their white-ball tour of the Caribbean in December.\n\n\"Yeah, we will try to. We will try here, as I said before, that we are trying to prove the point, but it's not a fluke that we just came in the World Cup from an Asian country.... We are trying to get [give] some [a] good fight and surprise them because this is what happened to the bigger teams, I might think that they are not going to take [it] easy but for us we will try to give them a good fight because we have nothing to lose.

Jos Buttler's men, placed fourth in the table, cannot afford more slip-ups as they need 2 outright wins to have any chance of qualifying for the Super 8.\n\nMoreover, they also need to take care of their net run rate, which is currently at -1.800 following their 36-run defeat to Mitchell Marsh's Australia. The Three Lions will also look up the match between Scotland and Australia on June 16. If the Aussies lose to the Scots, England will be knocked out of the competition regardless of the results in their last 2 matches.\n\nEngland's bowling hasn't been at its best by any means. After failing to pick up a single wicket against Scotland, they leaked over 200 runs against Australia. Adil Rashid, currently the No.1 ranked bowler in T20Is, has picked up only 1 wicket and has leaked runs at an economy rate of 11.16.\n\nT20 World Cup: Full Coverage | Complete Schedule\n\nOman, on the other hand, have not been at their best under their new skipper, Aqib Ilyas. Having lost all 3 of their matches, they will be playing for pride. With England set to come out all guns blazing, Oman are likely to find themselves in more trouble in their last group match.\n\nEngland and Oman are yet to lock horns at the international level.\n\nDespite not winning any games until now, England have not tinkered with their playing XI. It should not be a surprise if they stick to their team in their penultimate group game. Oman, on the other hand, can give fast bowler Fayyaz Butt a chance.\n\nThe pitch in Antigua has been excellent for batting. Batters are also expected to find it easier in their run-chase. However, spinners are most likely to extract something out of the surface. Both matches went in favour of the chasing teams and hence, teams should opt to field first after winning the toss.\n\nEngland: Jos Buttler (c & wk), Philip Salt, Will Jacks, Jonny Bairstow, Harry

The encounter will take place at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua. Jos Buttler will lead the defending champions, while Aqib Ilyas will captain Oman.\n\nEngland still has a chance to qualify for the Super 8s. To keep their hopes alive, they must win this game against Oman and their subsequent match. Additionally, they will need favourable results from other games in their group to ensure a turnaround in their standing. On the other hand, Oman have already been eliminated from the competition after losing their first three games. Despite their exit, Oman will be looking to salvage some pride and possibly disrupt England's path to the next stage.\n\nThe pitch at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium is celebrated for its balanced nature, offering opportunities for both batters and bowlers to excel. Fans can expect a competitive clash between bat and ball on this surface.

Exceptional performances by Adil Rashid, Jofra Archer, and Mark Wood led to Oman's collapse for 47 runs. Phil Salt and Jos Buttler's swift batting sealed the victory, boosting England's net run-rate.\n\nEngland needed only 19 balls to thrash already-eliminated Oman by eight wickets in record time on Thursday and keep alive their hopes of reaching the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup.\n\nThe win with 101 balls remaining, and after an hour and 42 minutes, was the fastest in T20 World Cup history and crucially gave the holders a better net run-rate than rivals Scotland. Having won the toss and opted to bowl with the run rate in mind, England made a speedy start at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium as Oman were skittled out for 47 in 13.2 overs -- the fourth lowest total in T20 World Cup history.\n\nThat was also England's best bowling performance at a T20 World Cup. Spinner and man of the match Adil Rashid took four wickets for 11 runs off his four overs while Jofra Archer and Mark Wood, the latter chalking up his 50th T20 international wicket, bagged three each for 12 runs apiece.\n\nEngland came out in a hurry and Phil Salt hit the first two balls for sixes before being bowled with the third, Bilal Khan's delivery deflecting off the inside edge of the bat and onto the wicket. Will Jacks then went for five, caught by Kashyap Prajapati off Kaleemullah and England were 20-2 after two overs before Jos Buttler (24 not out off eight balls) and Jonny Bairstow (eight not out off two) got the job done in 3.1 overs.\n\n\"I thought the tone was set really well by the bowlers, picking up the early wickets,\" said captain Buttler, who smashed four fours and a six in the third over. Bairstow then hit a final four to end the match.\n\n\"Job done today, another big game in two days' time,\" said Buttler. England play Namibia on Saturday while Australia play Scotland the same day.\n\nA win for England and defeat for Scotland will send the holders through along with already-qualified Australia, who bowled Namibia out\n\nfor 72 on Tuesday. England's Group B opener against Scotland in Barbados was washed out and a loss to Australia meant they had to win their remaining two matches to move level on points with the Scots, who had a significantly superior net run-rate.\n\nAustralia have six points to Scotland's five and England on three after three matches each. \"We had a point to prove after the last couple of games,\" said Wood.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"},

Mott admitted that England could only hope to take it as a joke and concentrate on the games ahead.\n\nHeading into the World Cup as one of the favourites, England have been stumbled early resulting in a nervy qualification situation. The initial washout to Scotland and a comprehensive defeat to Australia by 36 runs compounded by a poor NRR of -1.80 has made progress tricky. It remains to be said, however, that it is not doom and gloom for England with Oman and Namibia their remaining two opponents and they would fancy their chances to get two massive wins.\n\nOman come into this fixture without a win in any of the three games they have played. A thumping defeat to Scotland who chased 151 in merely 13.1 overs has knocked them out of the tournament. However, with pride on the line and the opportunity to play spoilsport against the defending champions will be a big motivation.\n\nWhen: England vs Oman, 7:00 PM GMT (June 13), 3:00 PM local time, 00:30 AM IST (June 14)\n\nWhere: Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, North Sound, Antigua\n\nWhat to expect: The last two games at this venue have produced decent batting strips with both Scotland and Australia chasing their targets with plenty of overs to spare. There is however, a slight 20% chance of rain during the game and the team winning the toss would prefer to bowl first.\n\nTeam Watch\n\nEngland\n\nIn the aftermath of the Australia defeat, Reece Topley is set to be included in the XI in place of Mark Wood who has gone wicketless in the first two games. No other changes are expected in the XI.\n\nProbable XI: Phil Salt, Jos Buttler (c/wk), Will Jacks, Jonny Bairstow, Harry Brook, Liam Livingstone, Moeen Ali, Sam Curran, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Reece Topley\n\nOman\n\nPratik Athavale and Ayaan Khan had decent outings with the bat for Oman who managed to post 150 against Scotland but the rest of the batters have failed to come to the party for the Gulf nation. The bowlers were decent against Namibia and for over 10 overs against Australia.\n\nProbable XI: Kashyap Prajapati, Pratik Athvale (wk), Naseem Kushi, Aqib Ilyas (c), Zeeshan Maqsood, Ayaan Khan, Khalid Kail, Naseem Kushi, Mehran Khan, Shakeel Ahmed, Kaleemullah, Bilal Khan\n\nDid you know?\n\n- This is the first match between England and Oman across any format.\n\n- Aqib Ilyas has six 50+ scores from 25 T20I innings since November 2022\n\n- Jonny Bairstow has a poor record in T20 World Cups. In 12 innings, he has scored only 92 runs at an average of 10.22 and at a strike-rate of 91.09\n\nWhat they said:\n\n\"We've still got things in our control and that's all you can ask for. We've got two more games. We're treating this game with Oman in isolation. They've got our full attention. We're going to prepare really well for that. And then see what happens in this game. If we get into a position where we're in a dominant position and can push hard, we will. If we have to scrap and fight and get the two points, we will as well. So, we'll just keep an open mind, as we always will. But essentially, we want to play that brand of cricket. I think we had glimpses of it the other day. I thought we started well with the bat, but to get a full performance in is really important. Get that on-field confidence. I think we're really close, but obviously it's been a bit of a disjointed tournament so far.\" - England Coach Matthew Mott on England's preparation against Oman.\n\n\"Yeah, we will try to. We will try here, as I said before, that we are trying to prove the point, but it's not a fluke that we just came in the World Cup from an Asian country.... We are trying to get [give] some [a] good fight and surprise them because this is what happened to the bigger teams, I might think that they are not going to take [it] easy but for us we will try to give them a good fight because we have nothing to lose. All we have here is to gain some good confidence and maybe a win to end the positive side from this World Cup.\" - Oman all-rounder Ayaan Khan", "source": {"uri": "cricbuzz.com", "dataType": "news",

Speaking to Sky Sports Cricket, Root believed that England will be fine in their upcoming and that they know what they have to do in the marquee event.\n\n\"I think they'll be absolutely fine, they've got a wonderful squad of players.

Both teams come into the match with contrasting fortunes: England seeking a vital win to keep their Super Eights hopes alive, while Oman look to salvage pride after three successive defeats.\n\nEngland quest for redemption\n\nEngland's World Cup campaign has been shaky so far. Two losses in their opening matches have put them under immense pressure. They need a convincing win against Oman, followed by victories against Namibia and a favorable result elsewhere, to potentially progress to the Super Eights stage.\n\nOman batting woes\n\nOman, despite valiant efforts against Namibia and Australia, have struggled with their batting. A string of dropped catches and a lack of intent have hampered their progress. They'll be looking to address these issues and end their tournament on a high.\n\nENG vs OMA: Head-to-Head\n\nThis match marks the first-ever meeting between England and Oman in a full international fixture.\n\nEngland vs Oman Team News\n\nEngland are expected to bring in Reece Topley for his pace and swing bowling, likely replacing Chris Jordan.

Speaking to Sky Sports Cricket, Root believed that England will be fine in their upcoming and that they know what they have to do in the marquee event.\n\n\"I think they'll be absolutely fine, they've got a wonderful squad of players. They know exactly what they need to do. When it's all laid out and they've got their backs to the wall, which they have in this situation now, is when they play their best cricket. It could really bring the best out of them, so I've got no worries whatsoever,\" Root was quoted by Sky Sports as saying. Root added that if England do what they are capable of doing then they will confirm their place in the Super Eights of the T20 World Cup 2024.\n\n\"If they go out and do what they all know that they're capable of doing, we'll be finding ourselves in the Super 8s and the back-end of the tournament where it really matters to play our best stuff,\" he added. The Three Lions will face off against Oman in the T20 World Cup 2024 clash at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium on Thursday.\n\nCurrently, England face a fear of being eliminated from the marquee tournament as they sit in fourth place in the Group B standings after a no-result against Scotland and a loss to Australia, a loss to either Oman or Namibia will eliminate the defending champions. In Group B, Australia have already qualified for the Super Eight and if Scotland beats them or loses to them by a very small margin in their next game on Sunday, Scotland could also proceed to the Super Eights along with the 2021 champions.\n\nOman Squad: Pratik Athavale (WK), Naseem Khushi, Aqib Ilyas (C), Zeeshan Maqsood, Khalid Kail, Ayaan Khan, Mehran Khan, Rafiullah, Shakeel Ahmed, Kaleemullah, Bilal Khan, Kashyap Prajapati, Mohammad Nadeem, Shoaib Khan, Fayyaz Butt.

England face the danger of being eliminated from the tournament. Sitting fourth in the Group B after a no result against Scotland and a loss to Australia, defeat against either Oman or Namibia will eliminate the defending champions.\n\nAustralia have already qualified for the Super Eight and if Scotland beats them or loses to them by a very small margin in their next game on Sunday, Scotland could also proceed to the Super Eights along with the 2021 champions.\n\nSpeaking about playing to eliminate England, Hazlewood in the pre-match press conference had said that eliminating England would be in the best interest of everyone.\n\n\"In this tournament, you potentially come up against England at some stage again and they are probably one of the top few teams on their day and we have had some real struggles against them in T20 cricket, so if we can get them out of the tournament that's in our best interest as well as probably (that of) everyone else,\" Hazlewood had said, according to ESPNcricinfo.\n\nMott downplayed Hazlewood's remarks.\n\n\"To be honest, I was informed of that this morning. Look to me, that is things out of our control and I think I know Josh pretty well and I know his integrity. I do not think that is a thing. He has got a very good sense of humour and hopefully, that is what he was doing,\" Mott said at the pre-match press conference.\n\nMott said irrespective of Josh's remarks or any other outside noise about qualification, run rates etc, the team is focused on winning their next game.\n\n\"I know Jos (Buttler) spoke really well yesterday about how we need to push hard in this game as well and I think that is what teams do. Nice, cool, calculated response. It is going to be a good wicket out here by the looks of it. We are going with a lot of confidence, I think. We have played good T20 cricket for a while now. It did not quite come off against Australia in the last game but I think we have got our structure in place, we are really confident. Those who saw us train yesterday, you can see a buoyant group up and about that is ready for the challenge ahead,\" he added.\n\nMott also admitted that while England has shown glimpses of its fearless cricket, the tournament has been disjointed for them.\n\nThe coach also said that the team is aiming to take some quick wickets during the powerplay.\n\n\"I do think it is a different ball game when you do take wickets in the power play, it is something we aim to do and hopefully comes off in this game. It does make your life a lot easier when you can come out of the power play and batters are not set but I think over time we will sort that out and certainly that is a big aim for our guys in this contest out here,\" he said.\n\nSquads:\n\nOman Squad: Pratik Athavale(w), Naseem Khushi, Aqib Ilyas(c), Zeeshan Maqsood, Khalid Kail, Ayaan Khan, Mehran Khan, Rafiullah, Shakeel Ahmed, Kaleemullah, Bilal Khan, Kashyap Prajapati, Mohammad Nadeem, Shoaib Khan, Fayyaz Butt\n\nEngland Squad: Philip Salt, Jos Buttler(w/c), Will Jacks, Jonny Bairstow, Moeen Ali, Harry Brook, Liam Livingstone, Chris Jordan, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Mark Wood, Reece Topley, Ben Duckett, Sam Curran, Tom Hartley.

T20 World Cup demolition", "body": ":England needed only 19 balls to thrash already-eliminated Oman by eight wickets in record time on Thursday and keep alive their hopes of reaching the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup.\n\nThe win with 101 balls remaining, and after an hour and 42 minutes, was the fastest in T20 World Cup history and crucially gave the holders a better net run-rate than rivals Scotland.\n\nHaving won the toss and opted to bowl with the run rate in mind, England made a speedy start at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium as Oman were skittled out for 47 in 13.2 overs - the fourth lowest total in T20 World Cup history.\n\nThat was also England's best bowling performance at a T20 World Cup.\n\nSpinner and man of the match Adil Rashid took four wickets for 11 runs off his four overs while Jofra Archer and Mark Wood, the latter chalking up his 50th T20 international wicket, bagged three each for 12 runs apiece.\n\nEngland came out in a hurry and Phil Salt hit the first two balls for sixes before being bowled with the third, Bilal Khan's delivery deflecting off the inside edge of the bat and onto the wicket.\n\nWill Jacks then went for five, caught by Kashyap Prajapati off Kaleemullah and England were 20-2 after two overs before Jos Buttler (24 not out off eight balls) and Jonny Bairstow (eight not out off two) got the job done in 3.1 overs.\n\n\"I thought the tone was set really well by the bowlers, picking up the early wickets,\" said captain Buttler, who smashed four fours and a six in the third over.\n\nBairstow then hit a final four to end the match.\n\n\"Job done today, another big game in two days' time,\" said Buttler.\n\nEngland play Namibia on Saturday while Australia play Scotland the same day.\n\nA win for England and defeat for Scotland will send the holders through along with already-qualified Australia, who bowled Namibia out for 72 on Tuesday.\n\nEngland's Group B opener against Scotland in Barbados was washed out and a loss to Australia meant they had to win their remaining two matches to move level on points with the Scots, who had a significantly superior net run-rate.\n\nAustralia have six points to Scotland's five and England on three after three matches each.\n\n\"We had a point to prove after the last couple of games,\" said Wood.", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Sitting fourth in the Group B after a no result against Scotland and a loss to Australia, defeat against either Oman or Namibia will eliminate the defending champions.\n\nAustralia have already qualified for the Super Eight and if Scotland beats them or loses to them by a very small margin in their next game on Sunday, Scotland could also proceed to the Super Eights along with the 2021 champions.\n\nSpeaking about playing to eliminate England, Hazlewood in the pre-match press conference had said that eliminating England would be in the best interest of everyone.\n\n\"In this tournament, you potentially come up against England at some stage again and they are probably one of the top few teams on their day and we have had some real struggles against them in T20 cricket, so if we can get them out of the tournament that's in our best interest as well as probably (that of) everyone else,\" Hazlewood had said, according to ESPNcricinfo.\n\nMott downplayed Hazlewood's remarks.\n\n\"To be honest, I was informed of that this morning. Look to me, that is things out of our control and I think I know Josh pretty well and I know his integrity. I do not think that is a thing. He has got a very good sense of humour and hopefully, that is what he was doing,\" Mott said at the pre-match press conference.\n\nMott said irrespective of Josh's remarks or any other outside noise about qualification, run rates etc, the team is focused on winning their next game.\n\n\"I know Jos (Buttler) spoke really well yesterday about how we need to push hard in this game as well and I think that is what teams do. Nice, cool, calculated response. It is going to be a good wicket out here by the looks of it. We are going with a lot of confidence, I think. We have played good T20 cricket for a while now. It did not quite come off against Australia in the last game but I think we have got our structure in place, we are really confident. Those who saw us train yesterday, you can see a buoyant group up and about that is ready for the challenge ahead,\" he added.\n\nMott also admitted that while England has shown glimpses of its fearless cricket, the tournament has been disjointed for them.\n\nThe coach also said that the team is aiming to take some quick wickets during the powerplay.\n\n\"I do think it is a different ball game when you do take wickets in the power play, it is something we aim to do and hopefully comes off in this game. It does make your life a lot easier when you can come out of the power play and batters are not set but I think over time we will sort that out and certainly that is a big aim for our guys in this contest out here,\" he said.\n\nSquads:\n\nOman Squad: Pratik Athavale(w), Naseem Khushi, Aqib Ilyas(c), Zeeshan Maqsood, Khalid Kail, Ayaan Khan, Mehran Khan, Rafiullah, Shakeel Ahmed, Kaleemullah,

The innings lasted only 13.2 overs - a marathon compared to what came next.\n\nWith the race on to chase the runs in 5.2 overs and move ahead of Scotland's rate of 2.164 in the process, Phil Salt set the tone by launching the first two balls of the reply hard over long-on for six.\n\nHe was cleaned up swinging at the third and Will Jacks followed but Buttler lashed 24 not out off just eight balls and Jonny Bairstow crunched both deliveries he faced for four to win it with 101 balls unused. No batting side has ever finished a game quicker at this level and England's net run-rate was dragged from -1.8 to 3.081 in the process.\n\nThe mission in front of England was clear from the off, with maximum points needed in each of their last two games and healthy margins a necessity.\n\nButtler won the toss and handed responsibility to his bowlers, trusting them to impose themselves rather than asking his batting line-up to aim for the stands.\n\nIt was a call he would not regret. Reece Topley, recalled for Chris Jordan in the only change to the XI, set the tone with a solid three over spell as Archer kicked off the procession of wickets at the Sir Andy Roberts End.\n\nAdil Rashid, left, claimed four wickets (Ricardo Malazan/AP)\n\nPratik Athavale and captain Aqib Ilyas were both unsettled by his length and lift, trying to get on top of the bounce but only succeeding in feeding low catches that were snapped up by Salt and Jacks.\n\nArcher should have had a third when Moeen Ali grassed an ankle-high chance at slip, but the missed chance barely registered as Oman failed to get to grips with task at hand.\n\nWood was handed the final over of the powerplay and was too hot to handle. He had Zeeshan Maqsood caught and bowled off his first delivery and quickly added Kashyap Prajapati, flapping to mid-wicket after being hustled for pace.\n\nAt 25 for four, much of the damage had been done, but England did not rest. In fact, the arrival of Rashid's well-honed leg-breaks and googlies merely accelerated Oman's decline.\n\nHe ripped his opening ball past Khalid Kail's sweep, who was stumped by a scrambling Buttler as he crept out of his crease, then watched as Mehran Khan offered Moeen the the easiest possible catching practice at slip.\n\nIn between Ayaan Khan dragged Wood into his stumps, another victim of the Durham player's speed through the air. Rashid bagged two more as he toyed with the tail, producing a pair of wrong 'uns that turned between bat and pad and sent the bails flying.\n\nJos Buttler, right, and Jonny Bairstow saw England over the line in record time (Ricardo Malazan/AP)\n\nOman snuck past the tournament's lowest ever score of 39 - made by Uganda earlier this month - but the end was close. Shoaib was last man out, top-edging Archer into Buttler's gloves to leave a regulation chase.\n\nSalt sauntered out in fifth gear, drilling Bilal Khan for two straight sixes before losing his stumps. Jacks chipped Kaleemullah to point soon after but there was no drama to be had, Buttler laying into Bilal's second over at a cost of 22, leaving Bairstow to apply the finishing touch.\n\nHaving averted calamity, England can now begin to make plans for a longer stay in the Caribbean providing no shocks against Namibia.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily

It reached 50-2 from only 3.1 overs, led by captain Jos Buttler's 24 from eight balls.\n\nIt was not only the magnitude of the win but the speed with which it was achieved that helped improve England's outlook at the tournament. It moved up to third in Group B with three points, behind already qualified Australia (six points) and Scotland (five points).\n\nMost importantly, England's net run-rate that was minus 1.800 before the match is now plus 3.08, ahead of Scotland's plus 2.164.\n\nEngland took a point from its first match against Scotland and was beaten by 36 runs by Australia. That made it imperative that it not only won Thursday's match but won it emphatically to improve its run-rate and prospects.\n\nButtler won the toss and chose to bowl, theorizing that England would be in a better position to manage the run rate equation if it was chasing.\n\nThe plan worked when England bowled out Oman for 47 in 13.2 overs on a glassy surface at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium which supported both Rashid's leg spinners and the England fast bowlers Jofra Archer and Mark Wood.\n\n\"We played exceptionally well,\" Rashid said. \"At the top Woody and Jofra set the tone and I thought we bowled exceptionally well as a team to bowl them out for 47.\n\n\"It's always nice to bowl the first ball and to see it spinning. When you get a wicket first ball as well it sets the tone a bit more.\"\n\nEngland needed quick wickets Thursday and Archer delivered, capturing his first wicket with the second ball of the second over of the match. He had Pratik Athavale caught at cover by Salt from a full, fast delivery that Athavale mis-timed.\n\nArcher then dismissed captain Aqib Ilyas in the fourth over when Oman was 16-2. Ilyas cut the ball to Will Jacks at backward point who held the catch just above grass-top height.\n\nThe England quicks operated well in tandem at the top of the innings and Wood added the wickets of Zeeshan Maqsood (1), caught and bowled, and Kashyap Prajapati (9) to leave Oman 25-4 at the end of the six-over power play.\n\nPrajapati was out to the last over of the power play and Khalid Kail (1) was stumped by Buttler from the bowling of Rashid to the first ball afterward. Rashid also dismissed Mehran Khan (0), Fayyaz Butt (2) and Kaleemullah (5). His googly was particularly troublesome for the Oman batters.\n\nArcher returned to dismiss Shoaib Khan (11) and finished with 3-12 and Wood removed Ayaan Khan (1) and also took 3-12.\n\nSalt clubbed the first two balls of the England innings over the long boundaries for sixes, then was bowled by the third ball from Bilal Khan (1-36) as he teed off again. Jacks came in and defended the fourth ball in a rare moment of calm.\n\nButtler carried his bat to get England home with 101 balls to spare, hitting a six and four fours. Jonny Bairstow hit two fours from the two balls he faced, including the winning runs from the first ball of the fourth over.\n\nEngland will now play Namibia on Sunday. Its qualification for the Super Eight stage is still dependent on the outcome of the other group match Sunday between Australia and Scotland.\n\nIf Scotland wins, it will qualify. England likely would advance if Australia wins with a superior net run-rate.\n\n\"I thought the tone was set really well by the bowlers who managed to pick up those early wickets and restrict them and knock them off,\" Buttler said. \"Job done today and we've got another big game in two days time.\"\n\nButtler said he told the England batters \"just to be ultra-positive. We'd spoken in the lead-up to this about how we have to win games and if we get the chance we have to try to take advantage with the net run-rate and we managed to do that today.\"\n\nEarlier, Bangladesh edged closer to confirming its second-round qualification by beating the Netherlands by 25 runs.\n\nBangladesh Wins\n\nWrist spinner Rishad Hossain spun Bangladesh to victory picking 3-33 in four overs, after star all-rounder Shakib al Hasan had scored 64 not out off 46 balls.\n\nBangladesh had put up 159-5 after it was put into bat, while the Netherlands was restricted to 134-8 in response in their Group D game.\n\nWith one game remaining, Bangladesh needs just two points to advance. It faces Nepal on Monday.\n\nThe Netherlands also needs a win against Sri Lanka on the same day, but will also depend on Bangladesh's result for its chances of qualifying.\n\nGroup leader South Africa has already confirmed its top spot from the group with three straight wins.\n\nPut into bat, Bangladesh opener Tanzid Hassan led the way with 35 off 26 balls. It was pegged back by off-spinner Aryan Dutt picking two early wickets.\n\nShakib and Hassan then added 48 off 32 balls to steady the ship.

Jonny Bairstow hit two fours off his only balls.\n\nWhat did Buttler have to say?\n\nWhile the England skipper was surprised with how the wicket at North Sound played, he was full of praise for how his bowlers adapted.\n\nHe said: \"I thought the tone was set really well by the bowlers, picking up the early wickets. Job done today, another big game in two days' time.\n\n\"There was that extra bounce, Topley with his height and Jofra with his high release point.

Should they build that lead with an expected comfortable win over Namibia in their final group game, it would take a mammoth Scotland upset over Australia - or a frankly embarrassing fix - to send Jos Buttler's side home.\n\nThe English attack proved too hot for an Oman side rarely exposed to the elite level, with leg-spinner Adil Rashid toying with his prey as he claimed four for 11 and pace pair Mark Wood and Jofra Archer returning matching figures of three for 12. The innings lasted only 13.2 overs - a marathon compared to what came next.\n\nWith the race on to chase the runs in 5.2 overs and move ahead of Scotland's rate of 2.164 in the process, Phil Salt set the tone by launching the first two balls of the reply hard over long-on for six.\n\nHe was cleaned up swinging at the third and Will Jacks followed but Buttler lashed 24 not out off just eight balls and Jonny Bairstow crunched both deliveries he faced for four to win it with 101 balls unused. No batting side has ever finished a game quicker at this level.\n\nThe mission in front of England was clear from the off, with maximum points needed in each of their last two games and healthy margins a necessity. Buttler won the toss and handed responsibility to his bowlers, trusting them to impose themselves rather than asking his batting line-up to aim for the stands.\n\nIt was a call he would not regret. Reece Topley, recalled for Chris Jordan in the only change to the XI, set the tone with a solid three over spell as Archer kicked off the procession of wickets at the Sir Andy Roberts End.\n\nPratik Athavale and captain Aqib Ilyas were both unsettled by his length and lift, trying to get on top of the bounce but only succeeding in feeding low catches that were snapped up by Salt and Jacks. Archer should have had a third when Moeen Ali grassed an ankle-high chance at slip, but the missed chance barely registered as Oman failed to get to grips with task at hand.\n\nWood was handed the final over of the powerplay and was too hot to handle. He had Zeeshan Maqsood caught and bowled off his first delivery and quickly added Kashyap Prajapati, flapping to mid-wicket after being hustled for pace.\n\nAt 25 for four, much of the damage had been done, but England did not rest. In fact, the arrival of Rashid's well-honed leg-breaks and googlies merely accelerated Oman's decline. He ripped his opening ball past Khalid Kail's sweep, who was stumped by a scrambling Buttler as he crept out of his crease, then watched as Mehran Khan offered Moeen the the easiest possible catching practice at slip.\n\nIn between Ayaan Khan dragged Wood into his stumps, another victim of the Durham player's speed through the air. Rashid bagged two more as he toyed with the tail, producing a pair of wrong 'uns that turned between bat and pad and sent the bails flying.\n\nOman snuck past the tournament's lowest ever score of 39 - made by Uganda earlier this month - but the end was close. Shoaib was last man out, top-edging Archer into Buttler's gloves to leave a regulation chase.\n\nSalt sauntered out in fifth gear, drilling Bilal Khan for two straight sixes before losing his stumps. Jacks chipped Kaleemullah to point soon after but there was no drama to be had, Buttler laying into Bilal's second over at a cost of 22, leaving Bairstow to apply the finishing touch.\n\nHaving averted calamity, England can now begin to make plans for a longer stay in the Caribbean providing no shocks against Namibia.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The innings lasted only 13.2 overs - a marathon compared to what came next.\n\nWith the race on to chase the runs in 5.2 overs and move ahead of Scotland's rate of 2.164 in the process, Phil Salt set the tone by launching the first two balls of the reply hard over long-on for six.\n\nHe was cleaned up swinging at the third and Will Jacks followed but Buttler lashed 24 not out off just eight balls and Jonny Bairstow crunched both deliveries he faced for four to win it with 101 balls unused. No batting side has ever finished a game quicker at this level and England's net run-rate was dragged from -1.8 to 3.081 in the process.\n\nThe mission in front of England was clear from the off, with maximum points needed in each of their last two games and healthy margins a necessity.\n\nButtler won the toss and handed responsibility to his bowlers, trusting them to impose themselves rather than asking his batting line-up to aim for the stands.\n\nIt was a call he would not regret. Reece Topley, recalled for Chris Jordan in the only change to the XI, set the tone with a solid three over spell as Archer kicked off the procession of wickets at the Sir Andy Roberts End.\n\nPratik Athavale and captain Aqib Ilyas were both unsettled by his length and lift, trying to get on top of the bounce but only succeeding in feeding low catches that were snapped up by Salt and Jacks.\n\nArcher should have had a third when Moeen Ali grassed an ankle-high chance at slip, but the missed chance barely registered as Oman failed to get to grips with task at hand.\n\nWood was handed the final over of the powerplay and was too hot to handle. He had Zeeshan Maqsood caught and bowled off his first delivery and quickly added Kashyap Prajapati, flapping to mid-wicket after being hustled for pace.\n\nAt 25 for four, much of the damage had been done, but England did not rest. In fact, the arrival of Rashid's well-honed leg-breaks and googlies merely accelerated Oman's decline.\n\nHe ripped his opening ball past Khalid Kail's sweep, who was stumped by a scrambling Buttler as he crept out of his crease, then watched as Mehran Khan offered Moeen the the easiest possible catching practice at slip.\n\nIn between Ayaan Khan dragged Wood into his stumps, another victim of the Durham player's speed through the air. Rashid bagged two more as he toyed with the tail, producing a pair of wrong 'uns that turned between bat and pad and sent the bails flying.\n\nOman snuck past the tournament's lowest ever score of 39 - made by Uganda earlier this month - but the end was close. Shoaib was last man out, top-edging Archer into Buttler's gloves to leave a regulation chase.\n\nSalt sauntered out in fifth gear, drilling Bilal Khan for two straight sixes before losing his stumps. Jacks chipped Kaleemullah to point soon after but there was no drama to be had, Buttler laying into Bilal's second over at a cost of 22, leaving Bairstow to apply the finishing touch.\n\nHaving averted calamity, England can now begin to make plans for a longer stay in the Caribbean providing no shocks against Namibia.", "source": {"uri": "cricket365.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

For the most part, it looked like men against boys.\n\nOnly West Indies, who were all out for 45 at Basseterre in March 2019, have been dismissed for fewer in a T20 international by England. On an island that enjoys its cocktails, this was just the tonic before tomorrow's game against Namibia.\n\nWith England needing to win inside 32 balls to ensure their net run-rate overhauled Scotland's even before the Namibia match, Phil Salt launched the first two balls of the chase from left-armer Bilal Khan over extra cover for six.\n\nHe was bowled off the inside edge aiming something violent at the third, before Will Jacks perished trying to carve Oman's tall fast bowler Kaleemullah over the off-side ring.\n\nBut wickets were irrelevant. What mattered was speed, and Buttler hurried England to their target with four fours and a six in Bilal's second over. When Jonny Bairstow pulled Fayyaz Butt for four moments later, victory had come in 19 balls.\n\nShould England beat Namibia tomorrow, only a Scotland win later in the evening against Australia in St Lucia can prevent them from progressing.\n\nThe rout, watched by a thin crowd, began in the second over, when Jofra Archer took revenge for being spanked for four by having Pratik Athavale caught low down at cover by Phil Salt. And Archer struck again in his second over, Oman captain Aqib Ilyas prodding low to Will Jacks in the gully.\n\nWood then induced a leading edge off Zeeshan Maqsood with his first delivery, snaffling an easy return catch, before Kashyap Prajapati pulled his sixth ball tamely to square leg. When Buttler stumped Khalid Kail at the second attempt, Oman were 25 for five, and a weight was beginning to lift from English shoulders.\n\nThere were moments of scruffiness. Moeen Ali dropped a sitter at slip to reprieve left-hander Maqsood off Archer, while Liam Livingstone dived over one in the covers during a tight opening spell from Reece Topley, who had come in for Chris Jordan.\n\nBut Wood persuaded Ayaan Khan to chop on for a single, and Rashid had Mehran Khan providing Moeen with catching practice at slip four balls later. He then produced a pair of googlies to bowl Fayyaz Butt and Kaleemullah, leaving Shoaib Khan as the only Omani to reach double figures. When he spooned Archer to Buttler, the innings was done and dusted in little more than an hour.\n\nIt was ruthless stuff from a side who have been accused of lacking edge during their week in Barbados. With managing director Rob Key expected back in the Caribbean imminently, he may find a happier group than the one he left behind in Bridgetown.\n\nOman batted poorly, unable to fathom the swing of Topley, the pace of Archer and Wood, or the variations of Rashid, whose main problem came from big-turning leg-breaks that kept being signalled wide.\n\nBut England made them look worse than they are. After all, the Omanis managed 125 for nine against Australia, and 150 for seven against Scotland. Here, though, a total of four fours and Prajapati's bold six over cover off Topley were the only moments they threatened to break the stranglehold.\n\nThe stakes had been raised in advance by comments from Australian fast bowler Josh Hazlewood, who suggested his team might consider manipulating Saturday's match against Scotland in St Lucia if it helped the Scots qualify ahead of England on net run-rate.\n\nThe England camp have done their best not to be distracted by either the numbers or the Australians' evident amusement at their plight, even if the ICC will be keeping an eye on the conduct of Mitchell Marsh's team on Saturday evening: manipulation of the net run-rate is a breach of the ICC code of conduct, and could in theory lead to Marsh's suspension.\n\nScotland joined in the merriment when Michael Jones, the opener who hit an unbeaten 45 off 30 balls against England at Bridgetown last week, said: 'If they want to play that way then happy days. We won't be complaining. If they want to let David Warner open the bowling or something like that it would be pretty funny.'\n\nBut, for England, the consequences of an early elimination would be deadly serious. That seemed less likely after the demolition job performed by their bowlers.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The innings lasted only 13.2 overs - a marathon compared to what came next.\n\nWith the race on to chase the runs in 5.2 overs and move ahead of Scotland's rate of 2.164 in the process, Phil Salt set the tone by launching the first two balls of the reply hard over long-on for six.\n\nHe was cleaned up swinging at the third and Will Jacks followed but Buttler lashed 24 not out off just eight balls and Jonny Bairstow crunched both deliveries he faced for four to win it with 101 balls unused. No batting side has ever finished a game quicker at this level and England's net run-rate was dragged from -1.8 to 3.081 in the process.\n\nThe mission in front of England was clear from the off, with maximum points needed in each of their last two games and healthy margins a necessity.\n\nButtler won the toss and handed responsibility to his bowlers, trusting them to impose themselves rather than asking his batting line-up to aim for the stands.\n\nIt was a call he would not regret. Reece Topley, recalled for Chris Jordan in the only change to the XI, set the tone with a solid three over spell as Archer kicked off the procession of wickets at the Sir Andy Roberts End.\n\nPratik Athavale and captain Aqib Ilyas were both unsettled by his length and lift, trying to get on top of the bounce but only succeeding in feeding low catches that were snapped up by Salt and Jacks.\n\nArcher should have had a third when Moeen Ali grassed an ankle-high chance at slip, but the missed chance barely registered as Oman failed to get to grips with task at hand.\n\nWood was handed the final over of the powerplay and was too hot to handle. He had Zeeshan Maqsood caught and bowled off his first delivery and quickly added Kashyap Prajapati, flapping to mid-wicket after being hustled for pace.\n\nAt 25 for four, much of the damage had been done, but England did not rest. In fact, the arrival of Rashid's well-honed leg-breaks and googlies merely accelerated Oman's decline.\n\nHe ripped his opening ball past Khalid Kail's sweep, who was stumped by a scrambling Buttler as he crept out of his crease, then watched as Mehran Khan offered Moeen the the easiest possible catching practice at slip.\n\nIn between Ayaan Khan dragged Wood into his stumps, another victim of the Durham player's speed through the air. Rashid bagged two more as he toyed with the tail, producing a pair of wrong 'uns that turned between bat and pad and sent the bails flying.\n\nOman snuck past the tournament's lowest ever score of 39 - made by Uganda earlier this month - but the end was close. Shoaib was last man out, top-edging Archer into Buttler's gloves to leave a regulation chase.\n\nSalt sauntered out in fifth gear, drilling Bilal Khan for two straight sixes before losing his stumps. Jacks chipped Kaleemullah to point soon after but there was no drama to be had, Buttler laying into Bilal's second over at a cost of 22, leaving Bairstow to apply the finishing touch.\n\nHaving averted calamity, England can now begin to make plans for a longer stay in the Caribbean providing no shocks against Namibia.", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

However, England remained third on three points, behind Scotland's five.\n\nOman, who lost all four of their games, narrowly avoided the record lowest completed total of 39 at any T20 World Cup, set by Uganda against co-hosts West Indies in Guyana last week.\n\nArcher did the early damage with 2-12 in nine balls, and Oman lost two more wickets in Wood's first over, slumping to 25-4 in six overs.\n\nWicketkeeper Buttler removed the bails at the second attempt to stump Khalid Kail off Rashid's first ball as wickets continued to fall.\n\nIn England's chase, Phil Salt struck the first two balls for six but was bowled off the third by Bilal Khan.\n\nEngland, who lost to Australia after their group game with Scotland was abandoned due to rain, will play Namibia on Saturday, while Australia and Scotland will meet on Sunday after England have completed their group games.\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

alive their hopes of reaching the Super Eight stage.\n\nHaving won the toss and opted to bowl with the run rate in mind, the holders made a speedy start at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium as Oman were skittled out for 47 in 13.2 overs -- the fourth lowest total in T20 World Cup history.\n\nSpinner Adil Rashid took four wickets for 11 runs off his four overs while Jofra Archer and Mark Wood, the latter chalking up his 50th T20 international wicket, bagged three each for 12 runs apiece.\n\nEngland came out in a hurry and Phil Salt hit the first two balls for sixes before being bowled with the third, Bilal Khan's delivery deflecting off the inside edge and onto the wicket.\n\nWill Jacks then went for five, caught by Kashyap Prajapati off Kaleemullah and England were 20-2 after two overs before Jos Buttler and Jonny Bairstow got the job done in 3.1 overs.\n\nEngland's Group B opener against Scotland was washed out and a loss to Australia meant they had to win their remaining two matches to move level on points with the Scots, who had a significantly superior net run-rate.\n\n\"We had a point to prove after the last couple of games,\" said Wood.\n\n(Reporting by Alan Baldwin

The match is set to take place at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua. It will have a huge consequence on England's future in the tournament. While Oman are already knocked out of the tournament, their only focus would be to upset the defending champions.\n\nThe Englishmen did not have a result in their first match against Scotland due to rain interruption as the match was called off. In the brief play that happened, England conceded 90 runs in their 10 overs. In their second match of the tournament, they lost to arch-rivals Australia by 35 runs. It has brought their campaign under jeopardy and the upcoming Oman fixture will be of high importance for the two-time champions.\n\nOman have lost all their matches in the tournament so far. They lost to Namibia, Australia, and Scotland. The match against England will be their last in the tournament. The Asian side would be hoping to end the tournament on a winning note. They have a good set of players who can play well against some of the best teams in the world. They key for the players would be to play well as a team.\n\nAlso Read: T20 World Cup: Manipulating match results against Scotland may lead to ban on Australia skipper Mitchell Marsh\n\nThat said, let's discuss Oman's strongest predicted Playing XI vs England in T20 World Cup 2024 match:\n\nThe side a good set of openers in the form of Pratik Athavale and Naseem Khushi. Athavale has been one of the best wicketkeeper-batters so far in the competition. The aggressive opener played a good knock in the last game against Scotland. His 54 off 40 balls helped Oman to post a total of 150 runs on the board. He will be the key for Oman to have any chance against England.\n\nAt the other end, the side has got the likes of Naseem Khushi. The guy has got massive talent, but has not been able to get going in the tournament so far. The nature of the pitches meant that the bowlers have gotten a better of him. As a result, would like to end the tournament on a good note by playing a good knock against a team like England, adding salt to their wounds.\n\nIn the middle order, Oman has a talented set of batters. Some of them are pure batters, while others can roll their arms over. Khalid Kail bats at number 5 for Oman. In the last match against Scotland, the middle order batter suffered an unfortunate early departure, thanks to the run out from Chris Sole. He would like to perform in a match with high magnitude.\n\nTo follow him at number 6, Oman has another talented batter in Ayan Khan. The emerging batter can also be handy with the ball with his part-time option. However, it didn't go well for Oman in the game against Scotland. He conceded a whopping 20 runs in the only over he bowled. He is unlikely to bowl in the upcoming match, but may be utilized if the need be.\n\nThere are some good set of all-rounder in the Omani squad. All of them bat in the middle order and a couple of them are the most experienced ones in their line-up. At number 3, skipper Aqib Ilyas will have a big boots to fill. He played an aggressive cameo in the game against Scotland and is also effective with the ball in hand, making him a key all-rounder in the set-up.\n\nWith the bat, he carries the ability to anchor the innings and add handy runs from his end. As a bowler, the slow left-arm bowler can operate in good lengths and trouble the batters. Additionally, Oman has Mehran Khan, who is a genuine All-rounder. As a bowler, he can operate in the middle overs. As a lower middle order batter, he can bat at the death overs and finish the games for his side.\n\nOman's bowling unit has some dependable names. Unfortunately, none of them could step up in the matches so far. Rafiullah is a talented bowler who did not get a chance to bowl against Scotland. If required, he can add some runs as well lower down the order. Shakeel Ahmad operates in the powerplay and the search overs. He conceded 23 runs in his 2 overs in the last match against Scotland.\n\nKaleemullah bowled decently in a wicket less spell against Scotland. He would be hoping to end the campaign on a high note with a good performance against England. Bilal Khan is the among the best pack in the pace bowling unit of Oman. The speedster claimed the wicket of Jones against Scotland and conceded just 12 runs. Additionally, they have a set of good All-rounders who can bowl some overs.\n\nPratik Athavale (WK), Naseem Khushi, Aqib Ilyas (C), Zeeshan Maqsood, Khalid Kail, Ayan Khan, Mehran Khan, Rafiullah,

The innings lasted only 13.2 overs - a marathon compared to what came next.\n\nWith the race on to chase the runs in 5.2 overs and move ahead of Scotland's rate of 2.164 in the process, Phil Salt set the tone by launching the first two balls of the reply hard over long-on for six.\n\nHe was cleaned up swinging at the third and Will Jacks followed but Buttler lashed 24 not out off just eight balls and Jonny Bairstow crunched both deliveries he faced for four to win it with 101 balls unused. No batting side has ever finished a game quicker at this level and England's net run-rate was dragged from -1.8 to 3.081 in the process.\n\nThe mission in front of England was clear from the off, with maximum points needed in each of their last two games and healthy margins a necessity.\n\nButtler won the toss and handed responsibility to his bowlers, trusting them to impose themselves rather than asking his batting line-up to aim for the stands.\n\nIt was a call he would not regret. Reece Topley, recalled for Chris Jordan in the only change to the XI, set the tone with a solid three over spell as Archer kicked off the procession of wickets at the Sir Andy Roberts End.\n\nArcher should have had a third when Moeen Ali grassed an ankle-high chance at slip, but the missed chance barely registered as Oman failed to get to grips with task at hand.\n\nWood was handed the final over of the powerplay and was too hot to handle. He had Zeeshan Maqsood caught and bowled off his first delivery and quickly added Kashyap Prajapati, flapping to mid-wicket after being hustled for pace.\n\nAt 25 for four, much of the damage had been done, but England did not rest. In fact, the arrival of Rashid's well-honed leg-breaks and googlies merely accelerated Oman's decline.\n\nHe ripped his opening ball past Khalid Kail's sweep, who was stumped by a scrambling Buttler as he crept out of his crease, then watched as Mehran Khan offered Moeen the the easiest possible catching practice at slip.\n\nIn between Ayaan Khan dragged Wood into his stumps, another victim of the Durham player's speed through the air. Rashid bagged two more as he toyed with the tail, producing a pair of wrong 'uns that turned between bat and pad and sent the bails flying.\n\nSalt sauntered out in fifth gear, drilling Bilal Khan for two straight sixes before losing his stumps. Jacks chipped Kaleemullah to point soon after but there was no drama to be had, Buttler laying into Bilal's second over at a cost of 22, leaving Bairstow to apply the finishing touch.\n\nHaving averted calamity, England can now begin to make plans for a longer stay in the Caribbean providing no shocks against Namibia.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Shoaib was last man out, top-edging Archer into Buttler's gloves to leave a regulation chase.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oman"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Oman"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Wood_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Wood (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leg spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adil_Rashid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adil Rashid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jofra_Archer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jofra Archer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqib_Ilyas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aqib Ilyas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Jordan_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Jordan (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reece_Topley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reece Topley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos_Buttler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jos Buttler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Roberts_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Roberts (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caught"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moeen_Ali", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moeen Ali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayaan_Khan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ayaan Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehran_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mehran Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Jacks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Jacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stumped", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stumped"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bail (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham_County_Cricket_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Durham County Cricket Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Googly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crease_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crease (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Archery", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Archery", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://d3gvyx4eg3tne0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Img38293093-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648571", "eventUri": "eng-9648571", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

After routing their opponents for 47 in the space of 80 balls at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua, they needed just 19 to hunt that total down, to hoist their troublesome net run-rate firmly into the black. Adil Rashid was the pick of an outstanding four-prong attack with figures of 4 for 11, before a turbo-charged chase capped by Jos Buttler's 24 not out from eight balls.\n\nAssuming England can achieve a further two points against Namibia on Saturday, Scotland will be left with the daunting task of beating the Group B leaders Australia if they hope to progress to the Super 8s - and even Josh Hazlewood at his most tongue-in-cheek might baulk at permitting that prospect.\n\nEngland entered this contest needing not only to win, but to win quickly, given Scotland's near four-point edge in the net run-rate stakes, not to mention the prospect of shenanigans in the Scots' own final contest against Australia on Sunday. To that end, Buttler decided he wanted \"to know how many runs we're chasing\" after choosing to bowl first at the toss. The answer, it would soon transpire, was \"not many\".\n\nThe tone was set in a ferocious powerplay, as England unleashed their heaviest artillery of the tournament to date. Two wickets apiece for Jofra Archer and Mark Wood, allied to a probing three-over spell of left-arm seam from the returning Reece Topley reduced Oman to a flaky 25 for 4 ... which immediately became 25 for 5 as Rashid announced his own arrival with another breakthrough first-ball.\n\nTopley surely counts as England's most luckless campaigner of recent times. He could have been a key component of the 2022 title triumph had he not rolled his ankle on a boundary marker during a warm-up match in Brisbane, and he then broke his finger while tracking well during the doomed 50-over World Cup in India before Christmas.\n\nBut here he set the tone with an exemplary one-run opening over - remarkably, his first at a T20 World Cup since the 2016 event in India - whereupon Archer struck with his second legal delivery, as Pratik Athavale followed up an opportunistic slap through the covers with a low chance to Phil Salt at short cover.\n\nArcher made it two in as many overs when Aqib Ilyas chopped another low catch to Will Jacks at backward point, who clung on with a juggle - unlike Moeen Ali at slip two balls later, who let a routine snick from Zeeshan Maqsood flop out of his grasp. It scarcely mattered though. Maqsood had no desire to stay in line to a sharp loosener from Wood, as he lobbed a return catch off the quick's first ball, and though Kashyap Prajapati put a dent in Topley's figures with a slashed six over the short cover boundary, he too had no response to an injection of raw pace, as Wood cleaned him up with a clothed pull to midwicket.\n\nWith a game broken wide open, Rashid was the perfect weapon to exploit Oman's soft underbelly, and he did so with a display of unrelenting superiority. Four overs on the trot, a wicket in each, and just a solitary boundary cuffed through point by Shoaib Khan, amid a remarkable 20 dot-balls.\n\nHis first wicket came from his biggest ripper of the lot - an agenda-setting legbreak that almost turned sideways past Khalid Kail's unbalanced sweep, and left Jos Buttler with so far to reach with his gloves that he missed his first attempt at the stumping, and only succeeded with the second due to Kail's galling lack of game-awareness.\n\nMoeen made amends for his drop in Rashid's second over, with a comfortable take off a loose drive from Mehran Khan, by which stage Wood had bagged his 50th T20I wicket with another full-length rocket to induce an inside-edge from Ayaan Khan. Rashid's third was a pinpoint googly, ripping through Fayyaz Butt's gate after a previous attempt had thumped his pads, and when he repeated the trick with his penultimate ball to bowl Kaleemullah for 5, Oman were 47 for 9 and sunk.\n\nTwo balls later, Archer was back for his final over before Buttler had even considered turning to a fifth bowler, and he duly closed it out by inducing Shoaib Khan into a hoist behind square, for Buttler to mop up the resistance, tracking back towards fine leg.\n\nThe crunchy numbers said that England could go past Scotland's NRR if they won the contest in 5.2 overs or less. For as long as his three-ball 12 lasted, Phil Salt gave the impression that a 1.2-over finish was more realistic. Bilal Khan's first two balls were full and inviting, and got the treatment with mighty smacks over wide long-off for six. His third, however, was dragged back half a yard, to knock back his off stump via a thin inside-edge.\n\nThereafter, it wasn't quite so full-throttle, but not exactly a complicated scenario. After allowing himself a sighter, Will Jacks cracked a firm drive down the ground off a Kaleemullah no-ball, only to top-edge a similarly ferocious stroke in the same over. Jonny Bairstow, however, belted his first delivery over the covers for four, whereupon Buttler bludgeoned Bilal for four fours and a six in his second over. Bairstow then bashed his second four in as many balls, and that was the end of that.", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

First skittling Oman for 47 all out in the 13.2 overs, the batters then opened up the possibility of sundowners on one of Antigua's 365 beaches by knocking off the target, two down, in the space of 19 balls.\n\nMore important than those refreshments, one assumes, was the effect this quick kill had on the net run-rate column. England had begun their penultimate Group B match on minus 1.8, with Scotland, the only side they can keep them out of the top two, on 2.16. As Jonny Bairstow slashed Fayyaz Butt square to seal the win, England had leapfrogged this figure to reach a far healthier 3.01.\n\nThere are still a few hurdles for Buttler and Co to jump, not least repeating the dose against Namibia on Saturday. And a shock victory for Scotland over Australia in St Lucia later that day will make all this number-crunching irrelevant. Nevertheless, a campaign that slightly stumbled out of the blocks is at least up and running.\n\nThis was a bit of an ordeal for Oman, all told. Already out of the running for the Super Eight phase themselves, the associates faced an England attack augmented by a recall for Reece Topley - Chris Jordan the player to miss out - and in no mood to muck about. Bar the odd sliced boundary and a sloppy dropped catch at slip early on by Moeen Ali, it was one-way traffic on what looked like a road of a surface.\n\nTopley went wicketless in his three overs but his swing from the breeze - allied with the odd delivery that held its line - made him a handful. Instead, it was the dual pace of Jofra Archer and Mark Wood that blew Oman away initially, the pair going on to return identical figures of three for 12 with some fast-twitch blood and thunder.\n\nPerhaps most heartening for Buttler, even factoring in the standard of opposition, was the player of the match performance from Adil Rashid. Slightly wayward during last week's 36-run defeat to Australia in Bridgetown, the leg-spinner utterly purred throughout his four overs, four for 11. The ball was on a string as he made use of the cross-breeze on offer and deployed that trademark googly to devastating effect.\n\nThe run chase? Well, that was utterly vaporised. England needed to get there in 32 balls or fewer to overtake Scotland's net run-rate and this looked eminently possible when Phil Salt crashed Bilal Khan's first two deliveries over the rope. Bowled by the third via an inside edge, Salt walked off with a mildly absurd 12 off three balls.\n\nWill Jacks similarly perished attempting to target the grass banks but these two wickets were little more than dot balls, Buttler breaking the back of the chase when he smoked Bilal's second over for 22 runs and Bairstow applied the coup de grace.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType":

Neither team has a realistic chance of making it to the Super 8s anymore.\n\nOman are decidedly out of the tournament having lost each of their three matches so far. While Pratik Athavale and Ayaan Khan laboured around to play long innings with the former getting a fifty against Scotland, none of Oman's remaining batters put up a fight or stayed long enough. Oman ultimately finished up with just 150. Mark Watt and Brad Wheal were the pick of the bowlers for Scotland. George Munsey was in a hurry to finish the match for Scotland, but fell in the 40s after a display of aggressive batting. The day though belonged to Brandon McMullen who kept the aggressive outlook going and helped Scotland chase the target down in a little more than 13 overs.\n\nAfter their contest with Scotland was washed out, England put their campaign in jeopardy after losing to Australia. Australia started strongly with both David Warner and Travis Head getting quickfire thirties before middle order support from skipper Mitchell Marsh and Marcus Stoinis, both of whom got thirties of their own, albeit not as fast, had Australia breaching the 200-mark. Jos Buttler and Phil Salt started similarly with both of them breaching the 35-run mark in an aggressive manner, before Player of the Match Adam Zampa dismissed them both in the space of less than three overs. The two quick wickets blew England's chase to smithereens as Australia went on to a resounding 36-run win.\n\nSir Viv Richards Stadium Pitch Report:\n\nThe surfaces in the Caribbean are expected to be relatively high scoring compared to New York and other such American surfaces. Two matches have already been played at this stadium in the tournament, but the totals do not look like they are on the rise.\n\nAlso Check: ENG vs OMA Match Preview: Head to Head records, pitch report and more\n\nT20I Stats & Records at Sir Viv Richards Stadium:\n\nOut of 15, 6 matches have been won batting second. There haven't been any no results, and the average first innings total is only about 138.\n\nEngland vs Oman Strategies & match-ups:\n\nOman have not been in form at all, and England should look to use that to their advantage. While there isn't a precedent for very high totals, England can still use the conditions to suit them and expectedly walk away with the contest given their very low NRR which might result in their elimination in the group stage itself.\n\nThe important match-ups for this contest are: Jos Buttler vs Bilal Khan, Phil Salt vs Mehran Khan.\n\nJos Buttler was England's best batter in the loss to Australia, and he will once again have to be at the forefront of leading England's batting charge as NRR calculations will be looming on his and his team's minds.\n\nOman:\n\nOman's best bet at stopping the English batting charge will be with their bowlers. And not many names come up in the Omani bowling line up other Bilal Khan who finds himself in the top 10 wicket takers' list in the format. If he can apply any sort of pressure on the English batting, Oman can bow out of the tournament with a high.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"},

Batting first, Oman posted the fourth-lowest score in T20 World Cup history (47/10). Adil Rashid claimed 4/11 with Jofra Archer and Mark Wood taking three-fers. Phil Salt started by smashing two sixes before England opened their account with a win.\n\nIt was a magnificent bowling show from the Three Lions as Shoaib Khan was the only Oman batter with 10-plus runs (11). England were all over Oman, who folded in 13.2 overs. Rashid led the show with his quality spin. He dismissed Khalid Kail before cleaning up the tail. Oman were no match for Rashid's offerings. Pacers Archer and Wood impressed as well.\n\nAs per ESPNcricinfo, Rashid has raced to 336 T20 wickets from 298 matches at 22.80. He claimed his 10th four-wicket haul. 115 of Rashid's wickets have come for England in 109 T20Is. He averages 24.59 (ER: 7.39). This was his 3rd four-wicket haul. Rashid owns 26 T20 World Cup wickets from 25 matches at 24.07. He is England's second-highest wicket-taker after Stuart Broad (30).\n\nRashid is the first Englishman to claim multiple four-wicket hauls or more in T20 WC history. He had claimed 4/2 from 2.2 overs in the 2021 edition as well. Sam Curran (5/10) and Chris Jordan (4/28) own one four-wicket haul or more in T20 WCs.\n\nArcher managed 3/12 from 3.2 overs. He bowled one maiden over. The fast bowler has raced to 176 T20 wickets from 140 matches at 20.72 (ER: 7.67). In 20 T20Is, Archer now has 25 scalps at 22.20 (ER: 7.38). Playing his maiden T20 World Cup, Archer owns four scalps at 13.\n\nWood (3/12) was exceptional. He now owns 81 T20 scalps at 19.72. Notably, Wood has raced to 50 T20I scalps at just 18.42.

There was some extra bounce and we took our catches.\n\n\"Adil is a real asset for us, a magician. The only problem is that he bowls his overs in about a minute so there's not much time to rest!\"\n\nEngland needed to knock off the runs in 33 balls or fewer to overtake the Scots' run-rate.\n\nBut they weren't hanging around as opener Phil Salt hit the first ball of the run chase for six over cover and then repeated the feat from the next delivery.\n\nBut Salt was bowled third ball attempting another big hit and Will Jacks skied a catch to point.\n\nButtler had some fun as he plundered 24 not out from eight balls and Jonny Bairstow completed the job with a pull shot for four.\n\nButtler

Batters are expected to have a hard time as teams batting first as the average first innings score at this venue reads 123 (T20Is). One can watch the match live on the Star Sports Network and stream it on Disney+Hotstar (12:30am IST).\n\nAs Australia have already sealed a Super 8 berth, England must look to overtake Scotland to go through.

Photograph: Afghanistan Cricket Board/X\n\nAfghanistan will eye another all-round effort to crush an inexperienced Papua New Guinea in Tarouba, Trinidad, and enter the Super Eight of the T20 World Cup, a result that could knock out New Zealand.\n\nThe win will carry Rashid Khan's side to the Super Eight from Group C alongside the West Indies, who have qualified on Thursday with a win over New Zealand.\n\nIt will also mean curtains for the 2021 finalists New Zealand who have lost two out of two.\n\nThat Rahamanullah Gurbaz (156 runs) and Fazalhaq Farooqi (9 wickets) are currently leading the chart of run-makers and wicket-takers respectively is a just reflection of their fine run in this ICC showpiece.\n\nApart from Gurbaz, the experienced Ibrahim Zadran too has contributed well to Afghanistan's totals, making 114 runs with a highest of 70.\n\nIn bowling, pacer Farooqi has made a fine combination with Rashid, who has so far taken six wickets from two matches.\n\nIt has ensured that Afghanistan's opponents do not have any let-up either upfront or in the middle passage.\n\nPNG might be a spirited side, but it looks way beyond their abilities to overcome a formidable Afghanistan.\n\nTeams (from)\n\nAfghanistan: Rashid Khan (c), Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Ibrahim Zadran, Azmatullah Omarzai, Najibullah Zadran, Mohammad Ishaq, Mohammad Nabi, Gulbadin Naib, Karim Janat, Nangyal Kharoti, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Noor Ahmad, Naveen-ul-Haq, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Fareed Ahmad Malik.\n\nPapua New Guinea: Assadollah Vala (c), Alei Nao, Chad Soper, CJ Amini, Hila Vare, Hiri Hiri, Jack Gardner, John Kariko, Kabua Vagi Morea, Kipling Doriga, Lega Siaka, Norman Vanua, Sema Kamea, Sese Bau, Tony Ura.\n\nMatch starts at 6AM IST (Friday).\n\nPak worry over USA-Ireland clash\n\nIMAGE: USA will look to beat Ireland on Friday in order to progress. Photograph: USA Cricket/X\n\nIn a strange scenario, a non-playing Pakistan will be more keen on the result of USA and Ireland Group A match at Lauderhill, Florida on Friday.\n\nA win for USA, currently second in this group with four points, will end Pakistan's World Cup campaign -- Pakistan have two points from three matches -- and will also take the co-hosts into the Super Eight from this group along with India.\n\nIreland are a competitive side with experienced players in their ranks, but they have looked woefully out of sync and the task might be heavier against the US, who are playing some very good T20 cricket at the moment.\n\nUSA will be keeping an eye on the fitness of skipper Monank Patel, who missed the match against India on Wednesday with a left-shoulder injury.\n\nAaron Jones did the duty of skipper against Rohit Sharma's men in New York.\n\nThere is also a strong rain threat to the match as per weather predictions, and even a washout can end the campaign of Pakistan.\n\nIt will take the USA to five points and beyond the reach of Pakistan, who can now log a maximum of four points.\n\nTeams (from)\n\nIreland: Paul Stirling (c), Mark Adair, Ross Adair, Andrew Balbirnie, Curtis Campher, Gareth Delany, George Dockrell, Graham Hume, Josh Little, Barry McCarthy, Neil Rock, Harry Tector, Lorcan Tucker, Ben White, Craig Young.\n\nUSA: Monank Patel (c), Aaron Jones, Andries Gous, Corey Anderson, Ali Khan, Harmeet Singh, Jessy Singh, Milind Kumar, Nisarg Patel, Nitish Kumar, Noshtush Kenjige, Saurabh Nethralvakar, Shadley Van Schalkwyk, Steven Taylor, Shayan Jahangir.

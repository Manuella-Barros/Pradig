The Baltimore Orioles hosted three straight sellouts against Philadelphia in a series matching two of the top teams in baseball.\n\nThe New York Yankees played last weekend at Fenway Park against rival Boston. The Baltimore Orioles hosted three straight sellouts against Philadelphia in a series matching two of the top teams in baseball.\n\nAnd that was somehow just the undercard.\n\nNow for the main event: Starting on Tuesday night, New York hosts Baltimore for three games between the two clubs that have already opened up a big gap on the rest of the AL East. The Yankees are on pace to win 109 games, the Orioles 107. With only the division champion eligible to earn a postseason first-round bye, this could be the start of a compelling AL East title race.\n\n''I think it should be fun,'' Baltimore outfielder Colton Cowser said. ''I think that any chance you go into Yankee Stadium, especially with the year they're having, it's going to be a really good environment.''\n\nThe tale of the tape is as follows: The Yankees (50-24) have the best record in baseball; the Orioles (47-24) will be second or third depending on Philadelphia's result Monday night. The Yankees have the game's top run differential and the Orioles are second. The Orioles are No. 1 in home runs and runs per game and the Yankees are No. 2 in both categories. The Yankees lead the major leagues in ERA and the Orioles are No. 2.\n\nBaltimore, last year's division champ, has not lost any of its past 21 series against AL East foes, going 15-0-6. That includes winning three of four over the Yankees at Camden Yards about six weeks ago.\n\n''I think both teams have clearly established themselves as really formidable, but at the same time, it is a marathon. We've got a long way to go,'' New York manager Aaron Boone said. \"I think right now all I can say is both teams are really good, really dangerous and have a lot of potential.''\n\nBoth teams rely on the long ball. New York's Aaron Judge leads the majors with 26, and sure enough it's a Baltimore player -- Gunnar Henderson -- in second place with 22. Juan Soto has 18 homers and Giancarlo Stanton 17 for the Yankees. The Orioles have five players with at least 11.\n\nNew York and Baltimore have faced significant pitching injuries -- but in different ways. Reigning Cy Young Award winner Gerrit Cole hasn't pitched yet this season for the Yankees because of elbow nerbe inflammation, but the rest of the rotation has stepped up and five New York pitchers have started 70 of 74 games. The Orioles have had a healthy ace in Corbin Burnes, but the list of injuries to the rest of their staff is lengthy, with F\u00e9lix Bautista, John Means and Tyler Wells out for the season and Kyle Bradish and Dean Kremer currently on the injured list.\n\n''It's a really good team. They're very complete. They've had some injuries happen to their rotation, but their depth has served them well,\" Boone said. ''They continue to get good starting pitching, been able to close out games and they have a versatile and dynamic offense. They can beat you with power, they can beat you with speed, they can match up against you.''\n\nBurnes pitched Sunday against the Phillies and promising second-year right-hander Grayson Rodriguez worked Saturday. So the Yankees aren't slated to face either of them. Instead the Orioles have Albert Su\u00e1rez, a journeyman who has posted a 1.61 ERA this year, starting the series opener. Then rookie Cade Povich makes his third big league start, followed by lefty Cole Irvin.\n\nThe Yankees start Nestor Cortes on Tuesday and breakout star Luis Gil on Thursday. As for Wednesday, that's now set for Cole's return, which will add even more buzz to a series that already had plenty.\n\n''Looking forward to it, another great ballclub,'' Judge said. ''Excited to see them in the Bronx. It's going to be a fun series. The fans are going to be excited. We're looking forward to it.\"", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Park",

The Baltimore Orioles hosted three straight sellouts against Philadelphia in a series matching two of the top teams in baseball.\n\nAnd that was somehow just the undercard.\n\nNow for the main event: Starting on Tuesday night, New York hosts Baltimore for three games between the two clubs that have already opened up a big gap on the rest of the AL East. The Yankees are on pace to win 109 games, the Orioles 107. With only the division champion eligible to earn a postseason first-round bye, this could be the start of a compelling AL East title race.\n\n\"I think it should be fun,\" Baltimore outfielder Colton Cowser said. \"I think that any chance you go into Yankee Stadium, especially with the year they're having, it's going to be a really good environment.\"\n\nThe tale of the tape is as follows: The Yankees (50-24) have the best record in baseball; the Orioles (47-24) will be second or third depending on Philadelphia's result Monday night. The Yankees have the game's top run differential and the Orioles are second. The Orioles are No. 1 in home runs and runs per game and the Yankees are No. 2 in both categories. The Yankees lead the major leagues in ERA and the Orioles are No. 2.\n\nBaltimore, last year's division champ, has not lost any of its past 21 series against AL East foes, going 15-0-6. That includes winning three of four over the Yankees at Camden Yards about six weeks ago.\n\n\"I think both teams have clearly established themselves as really formidable, but at the same time, it is a marathon. We've got a long way to go,\" New York manager Aaron Boone said. \"I think right now all I can say is both teams are really good, really dangerous and have a lot of potential.\"\n\nBoth teams rely on the long ball. New York's Aaron Judge leads the majors with 26, and sure enough it's a Baltimore player -- Gunnar Henderson -- in second place with 22. Juan Soto has 18 homers and Giancarlo Stanton 17 for the Yankees. The Orioles have five players with at least 11.\n\nNew York and Baltimore have faced significant pitching injuries -- but in different ways. Reigning Cy Young Award winner Gerrit Cole hasn't pitched yet this season for the Yankees because of elbow nerve inflammation, but the rest of the rotation has stepped up and five New York pitchers have started 70 of 74 games. The Orioles have had a healthy ace in Corbin Burnes, but the list of injuries to the rest of their staff is lengthy, with F\u00e9lix Bautista, John Means and Tyler Wells out for the season and Kyle Bradish and Dean Kremer currently on the injured list.\n\n\"It's a really good team. They're very complete. They've had some injuries happen to their rotation, but their depth has served them well,\" Boone said. \"They continue to get good starting pitching, been able to close out games and they have a versatile and dynamic offense. They can beat you with power, they can beat you with speed, they can match up against you.\"\n\nBurnes pitched Sunday against the Phillies and promising second-year right-hander Grayson Rodriguez worked Saturday. So the Yankees aren't slated to face either of them. Instead the Orioles have Albert Su\u00e1rez, a journeyman who has posted a 1.61 ERA this year, starting the series opener. Then rookie Cade Povich makes his third big league start, followed by lefty Cole Irvin.\n\nThe Yankees start Nestor Cortes on Tuesday and breakout star Luis Gil on Thursday. As for Wednesday, that's now set for Cole's return, which will add even more buzz to a series that already had plenty.\n\n\"Looking forward to it, another great ballclub,\" Judge said. \"Excited to see them in the Bronx. It's going to be a fun series. The fans are going to be excited. We're looking forward to it.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "noah_trister@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Noah

The Yankees have the game's top run differential and the Orioles are second. The Orioles are No. 1 in home runs and runs per game and the Yankees are No. 2 in both categories. The Yankees lead the major leagues in ERA and the Orioles are No. 2.\n\nBaltimore, last year's division champ, has not lost any of its past 21 series against AL East foes, going 15-0-6. That includes winning three of four over the Yankees at Camden Yards about six weeks ago.\n\n\"I think both teams have clearly established themselves as really formidable, but at the same time, it is a marathon. We've got a long way to go,\" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. \"I think right now all I can say is both teams are really good, really dangerous and have a lot of potential.\"\n\nBoth teams rely on the long ball. New York's Aaron Judge leads the majors with 26, and sure enough it's a Baltimore player -- Gunnar Henderson -- in second place with 22. Juan Soto has 18 homers and Giancarlo Stanton 17 for the Yankees. The Orioles have five players with at least 11.\n\nNew York and Baltimore have faced significant pitching injuries -- but in different ways. Reigning Cy Young Award winner Gerrit Cole, who is scheduled to start Wednesday, hasn't pitched yet this season for the Yankees because of elbow nerve inflammation, but the rest of the rotation has stepped up and five New York pitchers have started 70 of 74 games. The Orioles have had a healthy ace in Corbin Burnes, but the list of injuries to the rest of their staff is lengthy, with F\u00e9lix Bautista, John Means, and Tyler Wells out for the season and Kyle Bradish and Dean Kremer currently on the injured list.\n\n\"It's a really good team. They're very complete. They've had some injuries happen to their rotation, but their depth has served them well,\" Boone said. \"They continue to get good starting pitching, been able to close out games and they have a versatile and dynamic offense. They can beat you with power, they can beat you with speed, they can match up against you.\"\n\nBurnes pitched Sunday against the Phillies and promising second-year righthander Grayson Rodriguez worked Saturday. So the Yankees aren't slated to face either of them. Instead the Orioles have Albert Su\u00e1rez, a journeyman who has posted a 1.61 ERA this year, starting the series opener. Then rookie Cade Povich makes his third big league start, followed by lefty Cole Irvin.\n\nThe Yankees start Nestor Cortes on Tuesday and breakout star Luis Gil on Thursday. As for Wednesday, that's now set for Cole's return, which will add even more buzz to a series that already had plenty.\n\n\"Looking forward to it, another great ballclub,\" Judge said. \"Excited to see them in the Bronx. It's going to be a fun series. The fans are going to be excited.

The Yankees are on pace to win 109 games, the Orioles 107. With only the division champion eligible to earn a postseason first-round bye, this could be the start of a compelling AL East title race.\n\n\"I think it should be fun,\" Baltimore outfielder Colton Cowser said. \"I think that any chance you go into Yankee Stadium, especially with the year they're having, it's going to be a really good environment.\"\n\nThe tale of the tape is as follows: The Yankees (50-24) have the best record in baseball and the Orioles (47-24) are third. The Yankees have the game's top run differential and the Orioles are second. The Orioles are No. 1 in home runs and runs per game and the Yankees are No. 2 in both categories. The Yankees lead the major leagues in ERA and the Orioles are No. 2.\n\nBaltimore, last year's division champ, has not lost any of its past 21 series against AL East foes, going 15-0-6. That includes winning three of four over the Yankees at Camden Yards about six weeks ago.\n\n\"I think both teams have clearly established themselves as really formidable, but at the same time, it is a marathon. We've got a long way to go,\" New York manager Aaron Boone said. \"I think right now all I can say is both teams are really good, really dangerous and have a lot of potential.\"\n\nBoth teams rely on the long ball. New York's Aaron Judge leads the majors with 26, and sure enough it's a Baltimore player -- Gunnar Henderson -- in second place with 22. Juan Soto has 18 homers and Giancarlo Stanton 17 for the Yankees. The Orioles have five players with at least 11.\n\nNew York and Baltimore have faced significant pitching injuries -- but in different ways. Reigning Cy Young Award winner Gerrit Cole hasn't pitched yet this season for the Yankees because of elbow nerbe inflammation, but the rest of the rotation has stepped up and five New York pitchers have started 70 of 74 games. The Orioles have had a healthy ace in Corbin Burnes, but the list of injuries to the rest of their staff is lengthy, with F\u00e9lix Bautista, John Means and Tyler Wells out for the season and Kyle Bradish and Dean Kremer currently on the injured list.\n\n\"It's a really good team. They're very complete. They've had some injuries happen to their rotation, but their depth has served them well,\" Boone said. \"They continue to get good starting pitching, been able to close out games and they have a versatile and dynamic offense. They can beat you with power, they can beat you with speed, they can match up against you.\"\n\nBurnes pitched Sunday against the Phillies and promising second-year right-hander Grayson Rodriguez worked Saturday. So the Yankees aren't slated to face either of them. Instead the Orioles have Albert Su\u00e1rez, a journeyman who has posted a 1.61 ERA this year, starting the series opener. Then rookie Cade Povich makes his third big league start, followed by lefty Cole Irvin.\n\nThe Yankees start Nestor Cortes on Tuesday and breakout star Luis Gil on Thursday. As for Wednesday, that's now set for Cole's return, which will add even more buzz to a series that already had plenty.\n\n\"Looking forward to it, another great ballclub,\" Judge said. \"Excited to see them in the Bronx. It's going to be a fun series. The fans are going to be excited. We're looking forward to it.\"\n\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

We've got a long way to go,\" New York manager Aaron Boone said. \"I think right now all I can say is both teams are really good, really dangerous and have a lot of potential.\"\n\nBoth teams rely on the long ball. New York's Aaron Judge leads the majors with 26, and sure enough it's a Baltimore player -- Gunnar Henderson -- in second place with 22. Juan Soto has 18 homers and Giancarlo Stanton 17 for the Yankees. The Orioles have five players with at least 11.\n\nNew York and Baltimore have faced significant pitching injuries -- but in different ways. Reigning Cy Young Award winner Gerrit Cole hasn't pitched yet this season for the Yankees because of elbow nerbe inflammation, but the rest of the rotation has stepped up and five New York pitchers have started 70 of 74 games. The Orioles have had a healthy ace in Corbin Burnes, but the list of injuries to the rest of their staff is lengthy, with F\u00e9lix Bautista, John Means and Tyler Wells out for the season and Kyle Bradish and Dean Kremer currently on the injured list.\n\n\"It's a really good team. They're very complete. They've had some injuries happen to their rotation, but their depth has served them well,\" Boone said. \"They continue to get good starting pitching, been able to close out games and they have a versatile and dynamic offense. They can beat you with power, they can beat you with speed, they can match up against you.\"\n\nBurnes pitched Sunday against the Phillies and promising second-year right-hander Grayson Rodriguez worked Saturday. So the Yankees aren't slated to face either of them. Instead the Orioles have Albert Su\u00e1rez, a journeyman who has posted a 1.61 ERA this year, starting the series opener. Then rookie Cade Povich makes his third big league start, followed by lefty Cole Irvin.\n\nThe Yankees start Nestor Cortes on Tuesday and breakout star Luis Gil on Thursday. As for Wednesday, that's now set for Cole's return, which will add even more buzz to a series that already had plenty.\n\n\"Looking forward to it, another great ballclub,\" Judge said. \"Excited to see them in the Bronx. It's going to be a fun series. The fans are going to be excited. We're looking forward to it.\"\n\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

That clich\u00e9 is very true and we got a long way to go in all of this. All we can say right now is I think both teams are really good, really dangerous with a lot of potential.\"\n\nThe Yankees entered the first meeting leading the Orioles by a game in the division, and after the four-game series that featured three tight games and three Yankees losses, they trailed the Orioles by a game.\n\nSince then, the Yankees have gone 30-11 -- the best record in the majors during that span, despite going 5-5 in their last 10 games -- and yet they still only lead the Orioles by 1 \u00b9/\u2082 games atop the division.\n\nThe Orioles went 27-13 during that span, the majors' second-best record.\n\nTwo key differences for the Yankees this time around? Aaron Judge is looking like Aaron Judge and Gerrit Cole, the reigning AL Cy Young winner, is now set to make his season debut Wednesday.\n\nBy the end of the first series against the Orioles, Judge and Boone were both facing more questions about the slugger's quiet start to the season.\n\nJudge was batting just .197 with a .725 OPS and six home runs through 33 games.\n\nHe began setting the world on fire a few days later and has not stopped since, entering Tuesday batting .299 with a 1.110 OPS and a major league-leading 26 home runs on the year.\n\nJudge went 1-for-13 with two walks in the first Orioles series, though he was far from alone in that regard as Baltimore pitchers held the Yankees to just six runs and a .177 batting average during the four-game set. They will have a chance for redemption beginning Tuesday.\n\n\"Looking forward to it,\" Judge said Sunday after the Yankees dropped a second straight game to the Red Sox. \"Another great ballclub. Excited to see them in The Bronx. It's going to be a fun series, fans are going to be excited, so looking forward to it after the off day.\"\n\nDuring the first series, the Orioles pitched Grayson Rodriguez, Dean Kremer, Corbin Burnes and Kyle Bradish.\n\nKremer and Bradish are now on the injured list, which also includes Baltimore starters John Means and Tyler Wells, who have both undergone season-ending elbow surgeries in recent weeks.\n\nIt remains to be seen when or if Bradish (UCL sprain) will be back.\n\nThis time around, the Orioles are set to roll out Albert Suarez, Cade Povich and Cole Irvin as their starters, though they have kept humming along while leaning on the majors' highest-scoring offense (their 5.13 runs per game, just ahead of the Yankees' 5.05).\n\n\"They've had some injuries happen to their rotation, but their depth has served them well,\" Boone said. \"They continue to get good starting pitching. They've been able to close out games. And they have a versatile and dynamic offense. They can beat you with power, beat you with speed, they can match up against you.

The Orioles won 101 games last year. The Orioles -- who'd finished 40 games behind the Yankees as recently as 2021, when they'd lost 110 baseball games -- finished 19 games ahead of the Yankees in 2023.\n\nIt was one of the most adorable stories in baseball in years until the Orioles collided with the runaway train the Texas Rangers had become in October, losing three straight in the AL Division Series, a quiet end to a big, boisterous year at Orioles Park at Camden Yards.\n\nThe Orioles are even better this year. They are 47-24, which is a pace for 107 wins. They are tied with the Yankees in the loss column, something that looks like a misprint given how dominating the Yankees have been across the first 2 \u00bd months of the season -- a dominance that was notably interrupted from April 29-May 2, when the Orioles took three of four in Baltimore and held the fearsome Yankees offense to six runs in four games.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to it,\" said Aaron Judge, who was revealed to be the leading All-Star vote-getter in all of Major League Baseball Monday afternoon. \"Another great ballclub. I'm excited to see them in The Bronx. It's going to be a fun series, and fans are going to be excited.\"\n\nThey ought to be. There is something to be said about the near-certainty Yankees fans have enjoyed against most of the opponents they've squared up with this year, notwithstanding the unexpected weekend O-fer they took Saturday and Sunday in Boston.\n\nYou've mostly been able to set your watch by the Yankees. In another time, with another group of high-powered Yankees, the team's owner, Col. Jacob Ruppert, famously said, \"The perfect afternoon at Yankee Stadium? It's when the Yankees score eight runs in the first inning and then slowly pull away.\"\n\nThese Yankees have come awful close, on a lot of nights, to honoring that brash decree, and there's a time and a place for a timely homestand against the Twins, against the Tigers, against the White Sox.\n\nBut there's also something to be said about playing three games like this which will bring us all right to the doorstep of summer, three games against the one team in the American League that seems hellbent on pushing the Yankees across every day of summer, on into the fall. If it seems inevitable that there's to be an October collision between these teams that will be the only thing anyone remembers, that's fine too.\n\nThose were the ground rules against the Red Sox every year, too, at that point in this ancestral rivalry when they were the clear Alydar and Affirmed of the American League. Octobers provided the most drama. But Sox-Yanks was every bit as entertaining -- and every bit as much of a shadow box -- when the games took place in those years in April, June and August.\n\n\"It's a really good team,\" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said after Sunday's 9-3 loss at Fenway Park. \"They're very complete. They've had some injuries happen to their rotation, but their depth has served them well. They continue to get good starting pitching. They've been able to close out games. And they have a versatile and dynamic offense. They can beat you with power, beat you with speed, they can match up against you.\"\n\nBoone was talking about the Orioles, but he easily could've been describing his own team, too, across the board for the season's first 74 games, and that's what makes this series so intriguing.\n\nThe Orioles can match up against the Yankees and the Yankees can match up against the Orioles, and that's meant a lot of days and nights -- a lot of weeks, actually -- where if the Yankees were so inclined to look at the out-of-town scoreboard they'd notice the Orioles winning again, and if the Orioles were similarly inclined they'd see the Yankees up 7-2 on some overmatched club. Again.\n\nFor now in the American League, it is the Yankees and the Orioles, and the Orioles and the Yankees. The Guardians are only one game back in the loss column, but we've already seen plenty of the AL Central. We know all about the Yankees' 17-2 mark against the AL JV; the Orioles are also a healthy 11-2. And is anyone truly scared about how well the Mariners are playing out West?\n\nNo, until proven otherwise it's the Yankees and the Orioles in one place, and everyone else in the other. Which is why watching them play baseball against one another in the same place the next three games ought to be such a delight.\n\n\"I think it's going to be a good one,\" Yankees catcher Jose Trevino said. \"Coming back to The Bronx, after a road trip, facing a good team it's going to be fun.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [],

Bradish missed the first five weeks of the season and is back on the shelf with the same injury, while Cole has yet to make his season debut.\n\nThat is, until Wednesday when the Orioles come to town.\n\nBaltimore visits Yankee Stadium this week for a three-game series against its main division foe. Every game between the Orioles and Yankees will feel far more important than a normal regular-season contest given the two clubs are atop the American League standings, currently on pace to compete for the AL East title and the circuit's No. 1 seed. The Orioles (47-24) are 1 1/2 games behind the Yankees, who have MLB's best record at 50-24.\n\nThe Yankees aren't pulling any punches, putting Cole on a path to be ready to start the second game of the series Wednesday. Had Bradish not reinjured his elbow Friday and been placed on the 15-day injured list Saturday, he would've been rested enough to start Wednesday or Thursday.\n\nIn this way, the Yankees are getting stronger -- welcoming the return of the reigning AL Cy Young Award winner -- while the Orioles' rotation is weaker with the absence of Bradish, who finished fourth in the honor's voting last year.\n\n\"We got real fortunate the last couple years. This year, we've had our share so far,\" manager Brandon Hyde said about Baltimore's injury issues in 2024. \"Part of the game, a lot of teams are dealing with it. We've just got to do our best to have the next guy step up.\"\n\nNew York has the starting pitching advantage this week, as Oriole killer Nestor Cortes, Cole and AL Rookie of the Year front-runner Luis Gil will toe the slap for the Yankees. For the Orioles, it will be journeyman Albert Su\u00e1rez, prospect Cade Povich and southpaw Cole Irvin tasked with taming a Yankees lineup with Aaron Judge and Juan Soto in it.\n\nSu\u00e1rez and Irvin have pitched splendidly this season. The former sports a sparkling 1.61 ERA in his first year in the majors since 2017, while Irvin has bounced back from an up-and-down 2023 to be the Orioles' second most consistent hurler with nine straight starts of three or fewer earned runs allowed. And Povich, a lefty who will make his third career start opposite Cole, is coming off a stellar outing in which he shut out the Braves across six innings.\n\nHowever, despite the success of the Orioles' trio, the Yankees' is certainly more formidable. Baltimore ace Corbin Burnes and sophomore Grayson Rodriguez pitched this weekend against the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nThe Orioles make the trip to the Bronx on a heater, winners of 10 of their past 14. Since the Orioles were swept by the St. Louis Cardinals to end their AL-record sweepless streak, they've gone 18-6. But they've gained only 1 1/2 games on the Yankees, who went 16-7 during that stretch.\n\nWith a sweep, the Orioles would reclaim the top spot in the AL East, while they could fall to as far as 4 1/2 games behind New York if the Yankees pull off a sweep.\n\nOn the line for Baltimore is one of MLB's most impressive streaks. The Orioles haven't lost a divisional set since April 2023, a stretch of 21 series. They are 17-6 versus the AL East this year, including 2-1 against the Yankees.\n\nWith MLB's balanced schedule, the Orioles and Yankees play each other only 13 times, down from 19 before the change last year. In theory, that makes each game more important, especially considering the two clubs have already separated themselves from the pack in the division.\n\nThe Red Sox are 10 1/2 games behind the Orioles, while the Toronto Blue Jays are 12 games back and the Tampa Bay Rays are 13 1/2 games away. That means it's quite likely the AL East comes down to the Orioles and Yankees, increasing the stakes for all three games this week.\n\nBaltimore was off Monday for its first day away from the diamond since May 30. Despite the club's success during that stretch, Hyde could tell the toll it was taking on his players.\n\n\"This has been a grind,\" Hyde said. \"These guys, I could see them walking off the field, they're tired. To go about it the way they have, it's been a tough stretch and we've played really well through a really tough stretch.\"\n\nBut, as Hyde noted, \"it doesn't get any easier.\" After the Yankees, the Orioles face the Houston Astros, AL Central-leading Cleveland Guardians and the Texas Rangers before their next day off on July 1.\n\n\"Nobody's going to feel sorry for us,\" Hyde said. \"This is the big leagues. Now we're going to go to a real cool baseball environment and hopefully play well the next series.\"", "source": {"uri": "capitalgazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Capital Gazette"},

The reigning AL Cy Young Award winner, who struck out 10on Friday night with Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre and spoke in the visitor's clubhouse at Fenway Park on Saturday like a pitcher ready for big-league hitters, would slot into the rotation on Wednesday should he and the Yankees decide to go that route.\n\nBut the biggest difference in the teams coming into the three-game series -- one the Yankees enter at an AL-East-leading 50-24, good for a 1 \u00bd-game lead over the 47-24 Orioles -- is the performance of Aaron Judge.\n\nWhen the Yankees departed Baltimore, where Judge went 1-for-13 in the series, he was near rock bottom from an opening-month slump. Following action on May 2, Judge was slashing .197/.331/.393 with six homers, six doubles, 24 walks, 18 RBIs and a .725 OPS.\n\nIn the 40 games since, counting Sunday night when he hit his MLB-leading 26th home run, Judge slashed .387/.503/.937 with 20 homers, 16 doubles, 33 walks, 46 RBIs and a 1.439 OPS.\n\n\"We're looking forward to it,\" Judge said of the Orioles, who ran away with the East last season at 101-61, finishing 19 games ahead of the fourth-place Yankees (82-80). \"Another great ballclub, excited to see them in the Bronx. It's going to be a fun series. Fans are going to be excited, so we're looking forward to it after the off day.\"\n\nIt is too early in the season to play the positional \"who has the edge?\" game, but one conclusion can be drawn as of June 17 of this baseball season: In the wasteland of mediocrity that is the American League, the Yankees and Orioles have, to this point, separated themselves from the rest.\n\n\"I think both teams have clearly established themselves as really formidable,\" Aaron Boone said. \"But, at the same time, it is a marathon. That clich\u00e9 is very true. We've got a long way to go in all of this, and all we can say right now is I think both teams are really good, really dangerous and with a lot of potential.\"\n\nThe Orioles so far have survived several body blows to their rotation -- they lostl Tyler Wells and John Means for the season early on, Dean Kremer has been out for a month and Kyle Bradish went on the IL over the weekend with a UCL sprain. One of their top bullpen arms, Danny Coulombe, has left elbow inflammation.\n\nBut a balanced offense led by MVP candidate Gunnar Henderson (22 homers and a .958 OPS) and catching stud Adley Rutschman (14 homers and an .806 OPS), as well as organizational pitching depth filling in more than adequately, have Baltimore very much looking like a team that will fight the Yankees deep into September for the East crown.\n\n\"It'll be an exciting series,\" closer Clay Holmes said. \"Obviously, they got us the first series. We kind of know that it's going to be a battle for the division and these games matter. I think everybody's excited for the opportunity. We know it's going to be some of the best baseball, and those are the games you want to play in.\"\n\nSaid Boone: \"It's a really good team. They're very complete. They've had some injuries happen to their rotation, but their depth has served them well. They continue to get good starting pitching, they've been able to close out games, and they have a versatile and dynamic offense. They can beat you with power, they can beat you with speed, they can match up against you. They've got a few guys they platoon with that are impactful against the other hand. They're a complete team, no doubt.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees",

Since then the Yankees have honestly been the better team overall. The Orioles have lost some pitchers and Gerrit Cole coming back on Wednesday is huge for the Pinstripes. The Yanks had a disappointing series loss to the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park where the Red Sox stole nine bases which is embarrassing. Below is my quick take on this as seen in The Times Union:\n\nThe New York Yankees season doesn't officially begin until the playoffs start but between now and then there are certain series that will tell a bigger story like the one that starts Tuesday at home against the Baltimore Orioles. In the preseason the Orioles were the team to beat and still could be, but the Yankees are in first place. All eyes be on Yankee Stadium and especially Wednesday when Gerrit Cole makes his season debut. The Orioles beat the Yankees three out of four earlier in the season at Camden Yards and now the Yankees get a chance to punch back in the Bronx.\n\nLuis Gil continues to be incredible for the Yankees and has been their ace without Cole. The lineup has been so good led by Judge and Soto and that won't change and the Yankees have been very healthy for the most part.", "source": {"uri": "1045theteam.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "104.5 The Team ESPN Radio"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rodger_wyland@1045theteam.com", "name": "Rodger Wyland", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_Cole", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gerrit Cole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriole_Park_at_Camden_Yards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oriole Park at Camden Yards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Yanks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Yanks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Union_(Albany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Times Union (Albany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fenway Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Stadium_(1923)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yankee Stadium (1923)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Periods_and_Movements", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Periods and Movements", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/78/files/2024/05/attachment-GettyImages-1691545068.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659805", "eventUri": "eng-9659805", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

They were 1-2 in all the majors in runs against per game (Yankees, then Orioles). And they were 2-3 in the AL in defensive efficiency (Yankees, then Orioles).\n\nThese were not accidental tourists. They had earned the distinction as the class of the league. In a fairer world they would be in different divisions and both would earn byes out of the best two-of-three wild-card round. But that is not this world. The likelihood of this season is that they will occupy the top two spots in the AL East and very possibly the best two records in the league.\n\nYou can point to how teams that have gotten byes and been off for several days have generally not performed well in the postseason the past few years. But 30 out of 30 heads of baseball operations and managers would pick trying to figure out how to avoid rust over the potential of having a bad 48 hours and being out of the playoffs via a best-of-three.\n\nThat heightened an already intriguing series for mid-June that will include, among other items, the 2024 debut of Gerrit Cole and the major league debut of Ben Rice. But for the Yankees there was more on the table.\n\nThe Yankees might have come to this series from Fenway Park, but that Rivalry is not what it once was. Houston had replaced Boston as the most hated foe. To some degree, the Yankees had filled the historic, pre-2004 Cursed Red Sox role in that matchup since the Astros had eliminated the Yankees four times in four playoff tries since 2015 -- three of those in the ALCS. Add in the 2017 sign-stealing scandal and the vitriol felt for Yankee fans toward Jose Altuve, in particular, that felt Nomar-ish.\n\nThe Astros, however, might now be on the fade after seven straight ALCS appearances. But look who might be taking the baton: the Astros 2.0.\n\nBaltimore GM Mike Elias and his main lieutenant, Sig Megdal, were important decision-makers in the Astros' rise. And they followed a similar blueprint with the Orioles, tanking away a few seasons and hitting magnificently on key high draft picks to form the cornerstone of what sure looks like a franchise about to do a bunch of winning for a while, especially with private equity billionaire David Rubinstein as the deep-pocketed new owner.\n\nAlex Bregman, Carlos Correa and Kyle Tucker evolve into Gunnar Henderson, Adley Rutschman and Jordan Westburg.\n\nThe Orioles hinted at what was to come with an 83-victory breakout in 2022 followed by winning 101 games and the AL East last year as the Yankees rolled into an 82-80 \"disaster\" (hat tip to Brian Cashman). The teams played four games earlier this season at Camden Yards and the Orioles won three, holding the Yankees to a total of four runs.\n\n\"They're a very good team,\" said Yankees bench coach Brad Ausmus, who was serving as manager while Aaron Boone attended his son's graduation. \"I don't like saying that this is a must-win series in June because I don't think it is. But I think it's an important series. Because they took three out of four when we were there.\"\n\nHow important is this?\n\nIf the Yankees were not playing the Orioles would Cole have made another rehab start in his return from nerve inflammation in his elbow rather than start Wednesday in The Bronx? Well, Ausmus described Cole still in a buildup process, calling it \"another step in returning him to the full Gerrit Cole Cy Young award winner.\"\n\nConversely, the Yankees were missing the Orioles' top two healthy starters, Corbin Burnes and Grayson Rodriguez, in this series. In the last week, Baltimore had two starters, John Means and Tyler Wells, undergo season-ending elbow surgery. Kyle Bradish was lost with an elbow injury for the second time this year and the Orioles were awaiting more information to know how long the 2023 breakout will miss.\n\nBut the Orioles, like the Yankees, have continued to pitch well regardless of injury. And then there is the lineup that is good today with promise way beyond that. Baltimore has five players in their age-27-or-younger season qualified for the batting title with a 120 OPS-plus or better -- or three more than any other team in 2024. The last team to have that many over a full season was the incubation of the Big Red Machine as Cincinnati in 1969 had Johnny Bench, Alex Johnson, Lee May, Tony Perez and Bobby Tolan do it.\n\nThe Orioles are young, talented and have overt confidence. You can look at them and wonder if the Yankees don't do something to slow the train if they are going to have an Astro-nomic problem yet again.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news",

Overall, the O's \"continue to get strong starting pitching, they've been able to close out games, and they have a versatile and dynamic offense'' led by Gunnar Henderson.\n\nYankees notes\n\nThe Yankees will likely be playing for the next two months without lefty-hitting first baseman Anthony Rizzo, diagnosed with a fracture in his right arm as first reported by The Athletic on Monday.\n\nRizzo was involved in a collision at first base Sunday with Red Sox reliever Brennan Bernardino, and the Yankees might be playing DJ LeMahieu at first base and Oswaldo Cabrera at third base for the time being.\n\nSince coming off the IL due to a right foot fracture in spring training, LeMahieu is batting just .188 (9-for-48) with a .491 OPS and zero extra-base hits in 15 games.\n\nMeanwhile, Gleyber Torres is coming off a rough series at Boston, going 0-for-11.", "source": {"uri": "lohud.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Journal News"}, "authors": [],

At 47-24, Baltimore is just 1.5 games out of first place in the American League East as it readies for a three-game series in the Bronx, which begins Tuesday.\n\n\"It's a really good team,\" Aaron Boone said. \"They're very complete. They've had some injuries happen to their rotation. But their depth has served them well. They continue to get good starting pitching. They've been able to close out games, and they have a versatile and dynamic offense. They can beat you with power. They can beat you with speed. They can match up against you. They got a few guys they platoon with that are impactful against the other hand. So they're a complete team, no doubt.\"\n\nAs Boone mentioned, injuries have decimated the O's rotation. After most recently losing Kyle Bradish, Baltimore will start Albert Su\u00e1rez, Cade Povich and Cole Irvin against New York's top-ranked offense.\n\nThe Yankees, facing baseball's second-best offense in terms of runs scored, will turn to Nestor Cortes on Tuesday. Gerrit Cole will make his season debut on Wednesday before Luis Gil takes the mound on Thursday.\n\nWith Cole and Gil starting back-to-back games, the Yankees will get their first look at how they could potentially line up their rotation for a playoff series.\n\nThe Yankees and Orioles have already met once this season, as the Bombers dropped 3-of-4 at Camden Yards between April 29 and May 2. Three of those games were decided by two runs, including the Yankees' lone win, and Aaron Judge was still days away from breaking out of his early-season slump.\n\nThe slugger was hitting .197 at the end of that series, but he's since slashed a ridiculous .387/.503/.937 with 16 doubles, 20 home runs and 46 RBI over 40 games. Overall, Judge is now batting .299/.425/.686 and leading the majors with 26 home runs and 64 RBI.\n\n\"Looking forward to it,\" Judge said of the rematch. \"Another great ballclub. Excited to see them in the Bronx. It's gonna be a fun series. Fans are gonna be excited, so we're looking forward to it after the off day.\"\n\nWith Judge now in top form, he has a chance to pad his home run lead over Baltimore's Gunnar Henderson, who is second in the majors with 22.\n\nThe 22-year-old shortstop is working on an MVP-caliber campaign of his own, though the Yankees held him to two hits the last time they faced him. One of those was a home run.\n\nAsked what's stood out the most about Henderson, Boone said, \"The level of athlete that he is and the power and speed combination playing in the middle of the diamond, playing a premium position. The ability to hit the ball like a power hitter. And really, really run too, though.\n\n\"Just really an explosive athlete playing a premium position with a lot of power.\"\n\nHenderson can indeed do all of that, and he's not the only Oriole who can run. Baltimore has five players that have swiped at least five bases this season, making them an interesting follow-up after the Red Sox took a weekend series from the Yankees by stealing nine bases on Sunday night.\n\nJose Trevino was behind the plate for all of them.\n\n\"I think it's gonna be a good one coming back to the Bronx after a road trip, facing a good team,\" the catcher said of Baltimore. \"It's gonna be fun. It's gonna be a good one.\"\n\nWhile the Yankees are coming off their fourth series loss of the season, the Orioles just took 2-of-3 from the National League-leading Phillies. Before that, they did the same to the second-place Braves, who will visit Yankee Stadium later this week.\n\nFor now, the Yankees are focused on the Orioles. After losing the series in Baltimore earlier this season, they'll look to return the favor at home.\n\n\"That's a series and moment in time,\" Boone said. \"I think both teams have clearly established themselves as really formidable. But at the same time, it's a marathon. That cliche is very true: we got a long way to go in all of this. All we can say right now is both teams are really good, really dangerous and with a lot of potential.\"", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors":

Mullins played hero in this exciting game with a bloop single that gave Baltimore the lead in the 10th inning. He then came around to score after Jose Trevino sailed a throw into left field as Mullins stole third base. A weight seemed to lift off his shoulders as he crossed the plate, playing the hero in what's been a disastrous season thus far.

Stanton single-handedly brought the Yankees back in this one. First, his three-run home run off Yennier Cano cut the Orioles' lead to 5-4 and then his ninth inning single off Craig Kimbrel sent this game to extra innings.

First pitch is slated for 4:05 p.m.\n\nThe Yankees and Orioles are No. 1 and 2 across many statistical categories in the majors, and the previous 2 games have been decided by just 3 runs. Game 1 was a low-scoring affair while Game 2 saw some of the teams' top bats come out in full force.\n\nKeep reading for a look at the odds for Thursday's matchup.\n\nOrioles vs. Yankees Odds\n\nOdds above via Caesars Sportsbook. Check out our Caesars Promo Code for a look at one of the best welcome offers in the business.\n\nAs you can see, the Yankees are the favorite for Thursday's matchup at -135 moneyline odds. As per usual with a close game, Orioles +1.5 is heavily favored at -170 over +143 for Yankees -1.5.\n\nThis will be the 7th matchup this season for these 2 teams, Baltimore leading the way at 4-2 after a 3-1 series victory in Baltimore back in early May. The Orioles needed 10 innings to down the Yankees last night, winning 7-6.\n\nFour of the six games played to this point have been under the set total of 8.5, though the over is slightly favored in this contest.\n\nGil has been under this total in 3 of his last 10, and 2 of those \"over\" outings came against the Athletics and Mariners - teams with the most strikeouts of any in the country. In addition, he's been throwing less innings lately and faces an Orioles team that simply doesn't strike out much.\n\nJudge will be out for blood Thursday at Yankee stadium, and he's hit .500 against Cole Irvin with a home run once already in his career.\n\nI just don't think this is going to be a very close game for the Orioles after fighting for the win yesterday. Irvin has allowed 8.5 hits per game across his last 3 outings and faces one of the top hitting lineups in the majors.\n\nNew York Yankees vs. Baltimore Orioles Prediction (June 20)\n\nAaron Boone told reporters Wednesday night that he's \"hopeful\" Aaron Judge will be back in the lineup after exiting Wednesday's game with a wrist injury.\n\nAssuming Judge is back and understanding the Yankees are throwing one of the top pitchers in baseball tonight, Yankees -1.5 is my favorite play. New York is just in a better spot with Gil on the mound and has historically done very well against Irvin in the past, posting at .310 average with .396 OBP.", "source": {"uri": "sportsbettingdime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Betting Dime"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ethan_stone@sportsbettingdime.com", "name": "Ethan Stone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yankee Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_played", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Games played"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Irvin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cole Irvin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Boone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Boone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.sportsbettingdime.com/app/uploads/media/4/USATSI_23583538.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659805", "eventUri": "eng-9659805", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 1955, "textEnd": 1962}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

The 26-year-old earned his ninth win of the season for the Yankees in a 8-1 victory at Fenway Park on June 14 against the Red Sox. Gil is currently the runaway bet with -185 odds (Bet $185 to win $100) to take home the AL Rookie of the Year as he's stepped up in a big way to start the year with the absence of ace Gerrit Cole.\n\nMLB: Yankees captain Aaron Judge's connection to Willie Mays\n\nFacing the Yankees will be Cole Irvin, who's been one of the Orioles most consistent starters this year. While the 30-year-old southpaw has been solid in 2024, it's notable that he's surrendered eight or more hits in all three starts so far in June and is 0-2 with a 8.31 ERA versus the Yankees in three

The Yankees are No. 1 in wins, team ERA and RBIs, No. 2 in home runs and No. 2 in OBP and SLG%. Baltimore, on the other hand, sits at No. 1 in home runs, total bases, SLG% and OPS and No. 2 in RBIs and Team ERA.\n\nOdds above via BetMGM Sportsbook. Check out our BetMGM Promo Code SBD 1500 for a look at one of the best welcome offers in the business.\n\nThe Yankees, as expected, are listed as favorites for Tuesday night's AL East battle in the Bronx. The Yankees own the moneyline at -150 while Baltimore sits at +125. Alternatively, the Orioles are fairly significant favorites to keep the game within a run at -160. New York sits at +135 to win by more than a run.\n\nTrends can only be taken with a grain of salt when facing the best team in the league. The Yankees have struggled in division games against the runline this season, sitting at 8-11 in such contests. New York is 16-14 as the home favorite against the runline. The Orioles, meanwhile, are a near perfect 8-1 as the away underdog against the runline and 18-5 in division games against the runline.\n\nThe Over/Under is set at 9 for this matchup, with the over slightly favored at a mostly inconsequential -115. The Orioles have hit the over in 18 of their 32 away matchups this season (with 3 pushes) while New York is a perfect 15-15 against the over as the home favorite. To add to this, New York is 16-16 at home against the over.\n\nNestor Cortes is not necessarily known for being a strikeout pitcher, but he's performed very well against the Orioles in the past. Baltimore's lineup is hitting just .216 against Cortes with 50 strikeouts across 139 at-bats. He's especially had success against Gunnar Henderson and Ryan Mountcastle, striking out Henderson in 6 of their 7 faceoffs and Mountcastle in 11 of his 21 at-bats.\n\nRutschman is by far Baltimore's best hitter against Nestor Cortes across their respective careers. He's hitting .538 across 16 at-bats with 8 hits and a double. There's a chance we could be in for a multi-hit game from Rutschman (Odds +190 on DK).\n\nHenderson, as has been stated, has struggled against Cortes across his career. He's had a high propensity for strikeouts this season anyway and he's performing on the road tonight.\n\nNew York Yankees vs. Baltimore Orioles Prediction (June 18)\n\nI love the over in this matchup. The Yankees and Orioles are the 2 best offensive teams in the league and neither starting pitcher is likely to go past 5 innings or so (especially with Cortez pitching 7.1 his last outing on Thursday). Yankees ML is not a bad play either for those looking to play the outcome, though there is some risk involved at -150.\n\nThe Yankees need this series win after dropping 2 to the Red Sox and 2 to the Dodgers a week ago. With them returning home to Yankee Stadium and the Orioles exhausted having just played the monster Phillies (also, 2-2 in their last 4 all at home), the momentum seems to be pointing slightly in New York's favor.", "source": {"uri": "sportsbettingdime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Betting Dime"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ethan_stone@sportsbettingdime.com", "name": "Ethan Stone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_bases", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Total bases"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Mountcastle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Mountcastle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yankee Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.sportsbettingdime.com/app/uploads/media/4/USATSI_23561710.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659805", "eventUri": "eng-9659805", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 2636, "textEnd": 2643}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Our MLB odds series has our Orioles-Yankees prediction, odds, and pick for Tuesday.\n\nThe Orioles make the trip to New York to face the Yankees! These are the two best teams in the AL and they have been battling for the best record all season in the entire MLB with the Phillies too. Our MLB odds series has our Orioles-Yankees prediction, odds, and pick for Tuesday.\n\nLast Start: Pitched 5.1 innings and gave up zero runs on four hits with three walks and four strikeouts in an Orioles win.\n\nLast Start: Pitched seven innings and gave up two runs on six hits with two walks and two strikeouts in a Yankees loss\n\nThe Orioles come into this series with a 47-24 record and have won two straight games heading into this game. Their offense has jumped into the top 10, while their pitching is the second-best in the MLB. The Orioles have so much young talent behind the plate with Jordan Westburg, Gunnar Henderson, Adley Rutschman, Anthony Santander, Cedric Mullins, Colton Cowser, and Ryan Mountcastle making up the bulk of it, but there's more too. They improved their pitching this past offseason by adding Corbin Burnes to go with Grayson Rodriguez, Cole Irvin, Kyle Bradish, and Albert Suarez. The Orioles were the best team in the AL last season and improved this season, at least on paper.\n\nThe Orioles are starting Albert Suarez on the mound and he has a 3-0 record, a 1.61 ERA, and a 1.05 WHIP. Through 44.2 innings, he has allowed nine runs on 33 hits with 14 walks and 37 strikeouts up to this point in the season. The Orioles are 8-6 in his 14 starts this season. Suarez has split time between the bullpen and starting and has been great in both roles for the Orioles. This is a very difficult matchup against the Yankees and the bats that Suarez has to match up with.\n\nThe Orioles' offense has been one of the best in the MLB and has made a jump back into the top 10 of the MLB. They are 10th in team batting average at .249 after finishing last season at .259. The offense is led by Adley Rutschman and Gunnar Henderson leads the way in most of the batting categories. Adley Rutschman leads the way in batting average at .289, in 53 RBI, and in total hits at 80. Then, Henderson leads the way in home runs at 22 and OBP at .370. They get a more favorable matchup against Cortes on the mound because he has struggled recently.\n\nWhy The Yankees Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Yankees have been one of the best teams in the MLB with a 50-24 record. They are in the running for the best team in the MLB. However, they have lost three of their last four games and two straight heading into this series. Their bats have been great and their pitching is the best in the league. Juan Soto is a huge difference maker and an MVP-caliber player who was added to go with Anthony Rizzo, Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton, Anthony Rizzo, and Anthony Volpe behind the plate. Nestor Cortes, Marcus Stroman, Clarke Schmidt, Luis Gil, and Carlos Rodon have all been at varying levels of at least good to great on the mound.\n\nThe Yankees are starting Nestor Cortes as pitcher where he has a 3-5 record, a 3.59 ERA, and a 1.12 WHIP. Cortes has allowed 36 runs on 80 hits with 18 walks and 80 strikeouts through 87.2 innings. He has started in 15 games and the Yankees have gone 6-9 in those games. Cortes has been one of the weaker links for a great pitching staff and he gets a tough matchup against the Orioles and their offense behind the plate.\n\nThe biggest key for the Yankees is their offense. They are ranked fifth in the MLB currently in team batting average at .254 which is a massive improvement after struggling to .227 last season. Juan Soto has been a huge key player, leading in almost every batting category next to Aaron Judge. Soto leads the way in batting average at .315, in OBP at .433, and in total hits at 82. Judge then leads in home runs at 26 and in RBI at 64. This offense has an interesting matchup against Albert Suarez for Baltimore, who has been limited starting but has been great when on the mound across the board.\n\nFinal Orioles-Yankees Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Orioles have the pitching advantage with Suarez compared to Cortes for the Yankees. The Yankees are the better offense when compared to the Orioles. The Orioles are playing better than the Yankees currently, on a winning streak compared to a losing streak for the Yankees. Expect the Orioles to cover and potentially win on the road against the Yankees.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Juan Soto strangely ran into Westburg while the third baseman fielded a ground ball, while Albert Su\u00e1rez hit Judge on the hand with a pitch.\n\nThe Yankees' Gleyber Torres was also hit by a pitch on the hand, and shortly thereafter, an up-and-in fastball from Nestor Cortes came close to Gunnar Henderson's chin, causing cheers from the most rowdy among the sold-out crowd of 47,429.\n\nThe angst was at a season high, but the quality of baseball wasn't -- at least for the Orioles.\n\nSu\u00e1rez came back down to earth for his worst start of the season and it took eight innings to get Baltimore's bats off the train in the Orioles' 4-2 loss to the Yankees. With the win, New York takes a 2 1/2-game lead over Baltimore atop the American League East.\n\nThe Orioles' 34-year-old journeyman entered Tuesday with only three runs allowed in his previous 25 innings, most of which as a starting pitcher, but the Yankees tagged him with that many in just 3 2/3 frames. Meanwhile, Yankees southpaw Cortes lowered his ERA against Baltimore to 2.20 with six shutout innings as the Orioles went hitless in five at-bats with runners in scoring position.\n\nAnthony Santander's two-run homer in the ninth provided a sliver of hope, but closer Clay Holmes buckled down after to shut the door.\n\nBaltimore is 47-25 and is at risk of losing its first AL East series in more than a year. The streak of 21 straight divisional sets without a series loss is tied for the longest in MLB history since divisions were introduced in 1969.\n\nIncluding Tuesday, the Orioles have gone 47-23 against the AL East during the streak, including 17-7 this year. The last time Baltimore lost an AL East series was versus New York (51-24) in early April 2023.\n\nThe last time the Orioles and Yankees faced off seven weeks ago, New York held a one-game lead over Baltimore in a division that was expected to be baseball's most competitive. The AL East is still a beast, but not in the way that was expected. The Boston Red Sox, Toronto Blue Jays and Tampa Bay Rays appear to already be out of the race for the division crown, as all three have hovered around .500 for most of the spring.\n\nInstead, the Orioles and Yankees are in a heated battle for the title. Baltimore is attempting to repeat as division champs for the first time since 1973-74, while New York is looking to claim the title for the second time in three years.\n\nWhen that initial series ended in early May after the Orioles took three of four, Baltimore led New York by one game and then went 27-13 in its next 40, tied for second in MLB in that span. But the Orioles lost ground in the division race as the Yankees emerged as perhaps the best team in baseball, going 30-11 in that stretch.\n\nThey maintained that status early Tuesday against Su\u00e1rez, whose surprising success this season has saved the Orioles' injured rotation. Su\u00e1rez wasn't nearly as sharp as he's been most of the season -- he entered the game with a 1.61 ERA -- as he gave up 12 base runners, uncharacteristically walking five, hitting one and surrendering six hits. Leadoff hitter Anthony Volpe struck first with a two-out RBI single in the second. After Judge's hit by pitch in the third, he scored on Giancarlo Stanton's RBI single. Torres' sacrifice fly then gave the Bronx Bombers a 3-0 lead.\n\nSu\u00e1rez loaded the bases in the fourth on three walks, but left-hander Keegan Akin overcame his recent struggles versus lefties to get rookie Ben Rice, making his MLB debut, to fly out. New York took a 4-0 lead in the fifth when Torres scored on DJ LeMahieu's sacrifice fly off Akin.\n\nSantander's frozen rope in the ninth was his 18th homer of the season and ninth this month.\n\n* Manager Brandon Hyde did not provide updates on injured pitchers Kyle Bradish (ulnar collateral ligament sprain), Danny Coulombe (elbow inflammation) or Dean Kremer (triceps strain). Hyde said the club might have an update on Coulombe soon. Kremer pitched Sunday for Triple-A Norfolk in a rehabilitation start, but it's unclear whether he'll need another.\n\n* Shortstop Gunnar Henderson said he would be willing to hit in the Home Run Derby if he's invited by MLB. Adley Rutschman took part in the event last summer, putting on a switch-hitting show in the first round.\n\n* Corner infielder Coby Mayo, who Baseball America ranks as the Orioles' No. 2 prospect, returned to Triple-A Norfolk's starting lineup Tuesday after playing four games with High-A Aberdeen as he rehabilitated a fractured rib.\n\n* Norfolk catcher Blake Hunt, whom the Orioles acquired from the Seattle Mariners in the Mike Baumann trade earlier this year, was placed on the IL with a left groin strain.", "source": {"uri": "baltimoresun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Others were brushed back. Curse words were screamed from dugouts. And frustrations were expressed postgame.\n\nWelcome to the Orioles-Yankees rivalry circa 2024.\n\n\"Oh, definitely pissed,\" New York slugger Aaron Judge told reporters after the Yankees' 4-2 win. \"There was a couple balls up and in. That's part of it. They like to throw in.\"\n\nThe American League East remains MLB's best division, but it's already a two-team race. Judge, Juan Soto and the Yankees are currently leading near the halfway point, while Gunnar Henderson, Adley Rutschman and the Orioles are 2 1/2 games behind. Meanwhile, the Boston Red Sox, Toronto Blue Jays and Tampa Bay Rays are all laps behind, hoping to battle for a wild-card berth and far away from division title talk.\n\n\"Yeah, it's Yankee Stadium,\" Orioles left fielder Austin Hays said when asked about the intensity of Tuesday's game with a sold-out crowd of 47,429 in attendance. \"It seems like it's always a sellout every time we're here. The stadium fills up throughout the game, and the more pitches are thrown, the louder it gets. It was Yankee Stadium, just like it always is, tonight.\"\n\nThis past weekend's series in Baltimore against the Philadelphia Phillies was the first highly anticipated set of the season, a packed Camden Yards creating a playoff-like atmosphere for all three games. That series and this one against the Yankees -- a pivotal one given these teams will only face off in two more sets this season -- aren't outliers. As the Orioles have the national spotlight on them and chase their second consecutive 100-win season, there will be plenty more tense games like Tuesday's.\n\nAfter this week's series against the Yankees, Baltimore will play at least six more energized sets this season. Later this month, the Orioles will welcome the Texas Rangers to Camden Yards in a rematch of last season's AL Division Series. The final two games will be on national television: June 29 on Fox, and June 30 on ESPN's \"Sunday Night Baseball.\" Tuesday's game was aired on TBS, and the Orioles have at least nine more national TV games through the regular season.\n\nThree weeks later, the Orioles head to Arlington, Texas, to play at Globe Life Field for the first time since their 2023 season ended there in crushing fashion. Right before the All-Star break, the Yankees are back in Baltimore with two spotlight games, one on FS1 and the other streamed on Roku.\n\nIn August, the Orioles will head to Los Angeles to face the Dodgers, one of the National League's best teams and the front-runner to win the World Series, according to FanGraphs' odds. Corbin Burnes versus Shohei Ohtani? Henderson versus Tyler Glasnow? Yeah, that will also feel like a potential World Series preview the same way the Orioles-Phillies series did.\n\nIn September, the Orioles play at Fenway Park against a Red Sox team that appears likely to be in the wild-card hunt while Baltimore could be approaching playoff-berth clinching territory. Two weeks later, the final week of the regular season, could feature the biggest series of them all -- a three-game set at Yankee Stadium in which the clubs could be duking it out for the division crown.\n\n\"They're the Yankees. We know that they're a good team,\" said Hays, who compared this week's series with the Orioles' season-altering one last July in St. Petersburg, Florida, against the Rays. \"They're always at the top of the division. We always play really tough series.\"\n\nThe angst was bubbling underneath the surface the moment Soto strangely ran into third baseman Jordan Westburg, one of the Orioles' best players, while he was fielding a ground ball. Soto was called out for interference, and while it appeared he tried to evade Westburg, the unusual play still raised some eyebrows. Westburg exited the game with a bruised left hip.\n\n\"I didn't really understand it,\" Henderson said. \"He was having to come make the play in. But just kind of a freak thing.\"\n\n\"That's a strange play,\" manager Brandon Hyde said. \"You don't see that a ton. A routine ground ball, just ran into him on it. I don't know.\"\n\nOrioles starter Albert Su\u00e1rez then hit Judge in the hand, and reliever Keegan Akin later plunked Gleyber Torres in the same spot. The fans in the Bronx didn't approve. Neither did several team members in New York's dugout, who could be seen on TV broadcasts shouting expletives.\n\n\"It's a little frustrating and a little uncomfortable when you see it twice,\" Soto told reporters after the game. \"I hope it don't happen again.\"\n\n\"We don't take what happened lightly,\" Yankees cleanup hitter Alex Verdugo said. \"These are our guys and, obviously, captains. It's a big one for us. None of us are too pleased about it, but at the same time, I don't believe it was intentional. A couple pitches got away from their guys. It was just one of those things. If you can't [pitch] in, don't go in that day.\"\n\nSu\u00e1rez said he enjoyed the intense environment -- his first start at Yankee Stadium. Henderson, 22, said the energy is palpable in the stadium but that it still, to him, felt like a normal June game.\n\nOn the line Wednesday and Thursday will be another one of the Orioles' impressive streaks. They've won or split 21 consecutive divisional series, tied for the longest streak in MLB history since divisions were introduced in 1969. The last time Baltimore (47-25) lost an AL East series was against the -- yep, you guessed it -- Yankees in early April 2023. In that time, the Orioles have gone 47-23 against division foes.\n\nWhile it might feel like the Orioles' season lives and dies with each pitch, each controversy, each game this week in New York, that's simply not how baseball works. These games against the Yankees do mean more given the stakes of the AL East crown, but they are still only three out of 162.\n\n\"There's a lot of baseball games left to play,\" Hays said. \"They were the better team [Tuesday]. We've just got to come back and play better.\"", "source": {"uri": "baltimoresun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Baltimore Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_calvin_meyer@baltimoresun.com",

Owners of the best record in baseball, the New York Yankees (51-24, 23-10 home) welcome back reigning AL Cy Young-winner Gerrit Cole to the rotation on Wednesday night when the Pinstripes host the AL's second-best team, the Baltimore Orioles (47-25, 22-11 away), at Yankee Stadium at 7:00 pm ET.\n\nNew York took the first game of the three-game set on Tuesday night (4-2) and are heavily favored to win the second in Wednesday's Orioles vs Yankees odds.\n\nBaltimore Orioles vs New York Yankees Odds\n\nWith Cole on the bump against an untested rookie, the Yankees are -172 home favorites and +120 to win by at least two runs. The Orioles are +144 moneyline underdogs in Wednesday's MLB odds. The game total is sitting at 8.0 with the under slightly favored (-105o/-115u).\n\nOdds as of June 19 at FanDuel. Lock in a FanDuel promo code to bet on Orioles vs Yankees on Wednesday.\n\nThe public is currently hammering the Yankees in the MLB public-betting splits. New York is getting 88% of moneyline handle as 79% of runline handle.\n\nThe Yankees (+450) continue to close the gap on the Dodgers (+300) in the 2024 World Series odds, while the O's are the fifth-favorite at +850.\n\nCole Dominates in Latest Rehab Start\n\nComing back elbow nerve inflammation that sidelined him in March, Cole showed no signs of rust in his latest rehab start, striking out 10 over just 4.1 innings against Rochester, the Nationals' Triple-A affiliate.\n\nCole made two starts against the Orioles last year with mixed results. He allowed five runs on six hits and three walks over 5.0 innings with just two Ks on May 23. He was much better in the second, pitching seven shutout innings on July 28, allowing just three hits and no walks with five Ks. Ironically, the Yankees won the first (6-5 in extras) and lost the second (1-0).\n\nBaltimore will give 24-year-old rookie Cade Povich his third career start on Wednesday. The 6'3 lefty was abysmal in his first start, giving up six runs on five hits and four walks against the Blue Jays on June 6. But he bounced back brilliantly last time out, holding the Braves to five hits, no walks, and no runs over 6.0 innings with six strikeouts on June 12.\n\nA third-round pick of the Twins in the 2021 draft, Povich earned his callup with an outstanding start to his Triple-A season. The Nebraska product had a 3.18 ERA and 1.112 WHIP with Norfolk, averaging 11.9 strikeouts per nine innings. Control has been an issue, with a 3.3 BB/9 average, though that is down from 5.8 in 45.1 Triple-A innings last year.\n\nOrioles vs Yankees Prediction for June 19\n\nCole won't be asked to pitch too deep into his first start. The Yankees are in the luxurious position of holding a 2.5-game lead on the O's in the AL East and would be 9.5 clear in the Wild Card race. They can play the long game and be extra cautious with their ace.\n\nRelatively speaking, the O's have great numbers against Cole as a team. In 151 ABs, Baltimore's current lineup is slashing .258/.300/.437 against the 6'4 righty with five home runs and 12 doubles.\n\nBaltimore's bullpen is also outperforming the Yankees in almost every category this season. The Orioles' pen has 3.18 ERA (third-best in MLB) and a 3.55 FIP (fourth). New York's has a solid 3.35 ERA (sixth) but just a 3.85 FIP (14th).\n\nI like the value on the Orioles at significant plus-money.", "source": {"uri": "sportsbettingdime.com", "dataType": "news",

With the number sitting at 8.5 runs, what's the best bet when it comes to the total in tonight's game?\n\nOrioles vs. Yankees: Bettors backing New York on Wednesday\n\nAs of this writing, our MLB Public Betting Page shows that 63% of bets are on the Yankees' moneyline. That said, this page is updated frequently so make sure that you click on the link provided so that you're getting the most updated information.\n\nSantander's hot streak continues for O's\n\nAnthony Santander went 1-for-4 with a home run and two RBI in Tuesday's loss to the Yankees. Santander broke up a shutout in the ninth inning when he homered off Clay Holmes, who was brought on in a non-save situation. After getting off to a slow start, Santander has heated up in a big way as of late. The veteran right fielder is slashing .292/.347/.738 in the month of June with nine home runs and 16 RBI.\n\nX-rays and CT scan come back negative on Judge\n\nAaron Judge told reporters late Tuesday that X-rays and a CT scan on his left hand came back negative for any structural damage. Excellent news. It's an extremely positive update from Judge, who added that it's possible he won't wind up missing any time at all. The 32-year-old superstar was sent for additional imaging and further evaluation at a local hospital after being hit on the left hand by a 95-mph fastball during Tuesday's game against the Orioles, but it sounds like he's managed to avoid serious injury. It's a massive relief for the Yankees, and fantasy managers as well. He's day-to-day for the moment.\n\nOrioles vs. Yankees MLB Betting Trends\n\nYankees are 11-1 SU in their last 12 games played on a Wednesday\n\nOrioles are 10-3 SU in their last 13 games on the road\n\nYankees are 23-5 SU in their last 28 games played on a Wednesday when playing at home\n\nOrioles are 15-5 SU in their last 20 games against an opponent in the American League\n\nOrioles vs. Yankees MLB BETTING PREDICTION\n\nTake the under. The under is 4-1 in the Orioles' last five games against the Yankees. Cole might not pitch deep into tonight's game, but he should also give the Yankees a boost. Not that New York necessarily needs one. The Yankees boast one of the top pitching staffs in all of baseball this season.", "source": {"uri": "thespread.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheSpread.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anthony_rome@thespread.com", "name": "Anthony Rome", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CT scan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_Cole", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gerrit Cole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "X-ray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Holmes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Santander", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Santander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_played", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Games played"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.thespread.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Aaron-Judge-Yankees.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659805", "eventUri": "eng-9659805", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Stanton's 18th home run of the season traveled 440 feet.\n\nYankees left-hander Caleb Ferguson then hit lefty-swinging Colton Cowser in the side with a 94-mph fastball on a 1-1 count, prompting a frustrated Cowser to throw down his bat.\n\nNeither Gonzalez nor Ferguson were ejected, but the hit-by-pitches commanded extra attention considering Judge exited Tuesday's game after being struck in the left hand by a 94-mph fastball from Albert Su\u00e1rez.\n\nAfterward, Judge said he was \"definitely pissed.\" Imaging came back clean on Judge's hand.\n\nEven without Judge, the Yankees kept things interesting Wednesday. Anthony Volpe's leadoff double in the ninth against Kimbrel set up Stanton's game-tying hit.\n\nBaltimore answered in the 10th when Cedric Mullins delivered a one-out RBI single, stole third base and scored when catcher Jose Trevino's throw sailed wide. Holmes has now allowed two runs in three consecutive outings, though one of Wednesday's was unearned due to the automatic runner scoring.\n\nThe Yankees scored one run in the bottom of the 10th on rookie Ben Rice's sacrifice fly, but they couldn't scratch a second run across against Dillon Tate.\n\nIt all added up to Baltimore playing spoiler on the night Cole made his first MLB start since being diagnosed during spring training with nerve inflammation and edema in his right elbow.\n\nCole was charged with two earned runs over 4+ innings, during which he allowed three hits and a walk while striking out five.\n\nHe departed after allowing a leadoff single to Mullins in the top of the fifth inning in a 1-1 game. The next batter, Ram\u00f3n Ur\u00edas, struck a two-run home run off reliever Ron Marinaccio, putting the Orioles up, 3-1.\n\nThe 391-foot blast was one of three hits in the inning against Marinaccio, who also surrendered an RBI double to Ryan O'Hearn.\n\nNot fully built up after making three minor-league rehab starts, Cole threw 62 pitches and became sharper as the night progressed. The reigning AL Cy Young Award winner struck out three batters in the third inning and two more in the fourth, topping out at 97.5 mph with his fastball.\n\nBaltimore jumped out to a 1-0 lead against Cole in the first inning. Henderson led off with a 109.1-mph grounder that deflected off of second baseman Gleyber Torres' glove, and O'Hearn drove him in with a two-out RBI double two batters later.\n\nThe Yankees tied the game, 1-1, in the bottom of the first when Torres lifted a bases-loaded sacrifice fly to left field off Orioles rookie Cade Povich to complete an 11-pitch at-bat.\n\nPovich, the ninth-ranked prospect in the Orioles' loaded farm system, avoided further damage, limiting the Yankees to one hit and one run over his 4.2 innings despite issuing five walks.\n\nThe Yankees and Orioles entered this week's divisional showdown with the top two records in the American League, the same number of losses and only 1.5 games separating them in the AL East.\n\nIt should come as no surprise, then, that the much-hyped series in the Bronx is tied after two games.\n\nThe Yankees opened the three-game set with a 4-2 win on Tuesday night behind six shutout innings from starter Nestor Cortes.\n\nWednesday's loss cut the Yankees' (51-25) division lead over the Orioles (48-25) back down to 1.5 games.\n\nThe Yankees are now 2-4 against the Orioles, who won three of four in Baltimore during the teams' first meeting of the season.\n\nRookie sensation Luis Gil (9-1, 2.03 ERA) is set to start Thursday afternoon's series finale for the Yankees, while left-hander Cole Irvin (6-3, 3.03 ERA) is slated to pitch for Baltimore.", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_sblendorio@nydailynews.com", "name": "Peter Sblendorio", "type": "author",

While he has to face a lefty-lefty matchup with Cortes on the bump, he's thrived in that spot, posting a .291/.424/.557 slash line against lefties this season.\n\nNew York Yankees\n\nAaron Judge: Aaron Judge has been dominant this season, especially since the start of May. The former league MVP has been hitting .372 since May 1, and he comes into Tuesday's clash leading the American League in doubles, home runs, walks, slugging percentage, OPS, OPS+, and WAR.\n\nPretty good, huh?\n\nThe O's will look to keep Judge out of the hit column for just the second time in his last 10 games.\n\nOrioles vs. Yankees Prediction and Pick\n\nThis is just the seventh start of the season for Suarez, who has also come out of the bullpen, but he's been extremely effective for the O's posting a sub-2.00 ERA and a 2.79 Fielding Independent Pitching.\n\nWhile I don't want to base this play strictly on him, I think Suarez is good enough to keep the O's in this game before handing things over to their bullpen, which ranks third in MLB with a 3.20 ERA this season.\n\nThe Orioles do have a key advantage on offense, as they rank third in MLB in OPS against left-handed pitching. That should make things tough on Cortes, who has led the Yankees to just a 6-9 record in his 15 outings in 2024.\n\nNew York has been the best team in baseball to this point of the season, but I'm backing the O's to at least cover the run line in this one.\n\nBaltimore is an impressive 11-2 on the run line as an underdog, and I think it can chase Cortes early on to potentially win this game outright.\n\nPick: Orioles +1.5 (-162)\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.\n\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem and wants help, call 1-800-GAMBLER.\n\nThis article

Tonight's game won't be one that has a World Series potential, but the sole reason for that is because they both are in the American League, specifically, they both are in the AL East. The one thing that baseball should potentially change is the Division matchups. It is possible that the Orioles and Yankees could take each other on in the first round of the playoffs, but that is a long way away from happening.\n\nThe race between the Orioles and the Yankees is probably the most interesting of all battles in baseball this season. The Orioles currently sit behind the Yankees and that has to be a bit frustrating considering they are over 20 games above .500. The team is doing a great job on offense but still sits behind the Yankees in every offensive category except for Slugging Percentage and home runs. The one thing that I think the Orioles have going for them that the Yankees might not is that they seem to have more balance across their entire team. In my opinion, they are better at station-to-station baseball, but can also beat you with the long ball. Their pitching staff has been good for the season, and they are sporting a 3.07 ERA with a 1.13 WHIP and a .217 opponent batting average. They allow a lot fewer walks as well. Cade Povich is tonight's starter and he has only made two start for the Orioles. One of them was bad, and the other was really good. In the one road start, he allowed six earned runs on five hits in 5.1 innings. This was the first start of his career. In his second start, he was able to throw six innings and allowed five hits and no runs. The question is which version of Povich will show up? Will he shell up in the bright lights of New York? Or, will he show why he was pulled up to the Major League roster?\n\nThe rich get richer. We've already seen the Boston Celtics find a way to hang their 18th banner this year, are we going to see the Yankees add to their illustrious championship total? They certainly look like the best team in baseball and anything less than a World Series appearance would almost certainly be a disappointing season. The team has pretty much everything going for them, and is getting better today as they get back their best pitcher, Gerrit Cole. They did recently lose Anthony Rizzo for a stretch with a fractured arm, but gaining Cole is probably something they would've accepted in a trade anyway. Cole hasn't pitched this season, but now comes back to a team that doesn't even necessarily need him. He's been a great pitcher for years, and the team is better with him, but last year they needed him to be their best pitcher. He was able to do that with ease last season, going 15-4 with a 2.63 ERA and a 0.98 WHIP, along with 222 strikeouts. Will he come right out and be the stud he was last year or will it take him a moment to get his barring and adjust? I assume he will be on a pitch count or some sort of innings limit as well. He went against the Orioles twice last season. In the first game, at home, he allowed five earned runs over five innings. In the second game, he allowed no earned runs in seven innings on the road.\n\nI think the value in this game is actually on the Orioles. I think we are likely to see Povich perform closer to what he did against the Braves than what he did against the Blue Jays. I prefer to take the full game for the Orioles in this one because, although the Yankees bullpen is good, I think the Orioles probably keep it close against Cole and then can win the game against the Yankees later. I'll back the birds for the full game.\n\nFor more sports betting information and plays, follow David on X/Twitter: @futureprez2024", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_troy@outkick.com", "name": "David Troy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_against", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average against"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_Cole", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gerrit Cole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Rizzo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Rizzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/06/USATSI_23518051-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659805", "eventUri": "eng-9659805", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

It seems unlikely the Yankees will slow down much from their torrid start.\n\nIf the Orioles do find a way to win the AL, chances are it will be because they brought in some meaningful reinforcements at the trade deadline.\n\nThe Post's Jon Heyman reported last week that Baltimore is showing interest in Marlins closer Tanner Scott.\n\nThe Orioles should have a slightly better chance of stealing Game 1 than oddsmakers suggest, as Cortes has been in lesser form entering this matchup, and Baltimore hitters match up well against him.\n\nCortes has pitched to a 4.50 ERA over his last four outings, with a WHIP of 1.27. His hard-hit rate has spiked to 46 percent in those matchups and he has struck out only 19 percent of batters faced.\n\nWhile Cortes has been incredible at Yankee Stadium, the Orioles have been wearing out lefties.\n\nSuarez has an ERA of 1.40 since being converted to a starting role. He owns a 3.42 xERA and a 4.25 xFIP entering this matchup.\n\nSuarez will get his toughest test yet Tuesday, as the Yankees have been the best offense in the league against right-handed pitching with a wRC+ of 125 and a .450 slug rate.\n\nIn this specific matchup, the Orioles' offense can be power-rated comparably to the Yankees given the way they have crushed left-handed pitching. Cortes' form is tailing off and this is probably not the matchup for him to get right.\n\nThe Orioles are a solid bet as an underdog in the series opener. And if you're looking toward their futures, taking them to finish with the AL's No. 1 seed is a worthy bet at their current odds.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FanGraphs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FanGraphs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Bradish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Bradish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Wells", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Wells"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Means_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Means (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Albert Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Kremer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dean Kremer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yankee Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennant_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennant (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_collateral_ligament_of_elbow_joint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriole_Park_at_Camden_Yards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oriole Park at Camden Yards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestor_Cort\u00e9s_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nestor Cort\u00e9s Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Irvin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cole Irvin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Boone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Boone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_Cole", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gerrit Cole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanner_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tanner Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound_Racing/Tracks", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound Racing/Tracks", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/GettyImages-2150761573-e1718732949696.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659805", "eventUri": "eng-9659805", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Their last matchup came in the last week of April when the Yankees traveled to Baltimore, but the Orioles handled them swiftly by taking three of four games. Hoping to expand their lead in the division, Nestor Cortes would get the ball against Albert Su\u00e1rez, and the southpaw dominated across six innings to guide the Yankees to victory.\n\nAlthough this is a huge win for the Yankees, it comes with a massive scare as well, as Aaron Judge exited today's game after being hit in the hand with a fastball from Albert Su\u00e1rez. It was not intentional, but the Yankees are holding their breath on what could be a serious injury to the best player in the league.\n\nIt's hard to argue that anyone dominated more in today's game than Nestor Cortes, who fired six innings of scoreless baseball against a tough Baltimore Orioles lineup. He struck out six batters, walked none, and allowed five hits in the contest. Cortes didn't allow a single extra-base hit, and his ERA on the season lowered to 3.36 on the year. While the Yankees have had great starting pitching, the bouncebacks of guys like Nestor Cortes have set the tone for the rotation.\n\nOffensively, they got a lot of production in the early innings, as Anthony Volpe delivered a two-out hit in the second inning to give them a 1-0 lead that they wouldn't relinquish. In the following inning, a pitch hit Aaron Judge in the middle of a rally where they scored two runs on a Giancarlo Stanton single, and Gleyber Torres picked up a sacrifice fly as well.\n\nAaron Judge would exit the game in the inning after, with Trent Grisham coming into the game, but another part of that rally was Ben Rice picking up a hit in his MLB debut. He was taken out of the game for defensive purposes as DJ LeMahieu would go to first base and shore up their infield with a lead.\n\nA sacrifice fly from DJ LeMahieu in the fifth inning would give the Yankees a 4-0 lead, and the bullpen would come in to try and lock down the win. Michael Tonkin and Luke Weaver fired scoreless frames, but Clay Holmes surrendered his first home run of the season in the ninth to give the Orioles some life. With a two-run blast off the bat of known Yankee killer Anthony Santander, the Orioles pulled within two in the ninth, but Holmes locked in and shut the door.\n\nThe Yankees pick up a win after an ugly series in Fenway, and they improve to 51-24 on the season with a one-game lead in the loss column and a 2.5-game lead in the American League East. They'll have their ace Gerrit Cole make his season debut tomorrow as they hope to take the series, but they'll have the task of facing young left-hander Cade Povich who was a highly-rated prospect in the Orioles organization.\n\nAs I write this, the updates on Aaron Judge are that he's getting MRIs and X-rays on the hand, and there are not any updates there as Aaron Boone chose to put off any reveal on the results until doctors can read the results.", "source": {"uri": "empiresportsmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Empire Sports Media"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It was just Baltimore's second win in six games against the Yankees this season as the Orioles pulled within 1.5 games of New York in the AL East standings. New York was without Aaron Judge who was resting a sore hand after getting hit by a pitch in Tuesday. Retribution for that scary moment may have cost the Yankees the game.\n\nBaltimore had a 4-1 lead with one out in the top of the fifth inning when Victor Gonzalez hit Orioles shortstop and leadoff hitter Gunnar Henderson in the back with a pitch high and inside. Orioles announcers Kevin Brown and Brett Hollander were not happy. Though they couldn't tell for sure whether Gonzalez hit Henderson on purpose, they agreed that it would be the perfect time to get revenge if that's something you were interested in.\n\n\"This is a tough one because it is hard for us to know what's in Victor Gonzalez's mind,\" said Brown. \"He's hit three batters on the year. 22 innings. Here comes Matt Blake... So we cannot sit here. We cannot sit here and say with 100% certainty that he hit Gunnar Henderson, but we can say if the Yankees were thinking about doing something like this, down three in the seventh with the bases empty is the time you might do it. And if they did do it. And if they did throw up and in intentionally to Gunnar Henderson, frankly, shame on them.\"\n\nMichael Kay also wondered if the HBP was intentional on the Yankees feed.\n\nHenderson ended up stealing second with two outs and then scored on a Ryan Mountcastle double to make it 5-1. Henderson's run ended up being quite important as the Yankees came back to tie the game 5-5 in the bottom of the ninth. Without that Henderson run the Yankees would have won 5-4.\n\nOf course, the richest part of all this is that the Yankees are upset with the Orioles for hitting Judge, when the Yankees pitching staff has hit more batters than just about anyone. Henderson was the 41st batter to get hit by a Yankees pitcher this season and then in the eighth inning Caleb Ferguson hit Colton Cowser.\n\nCowser was actually the seventh Orioles batter to get hit by a Yankees pitcher in six games this season. Meanwhile, Baltimore has only hit three New York batters.

Our MLB odds series has our Orioles-Yankees prediction, odds, and pick for Thursday.\n\nThe Orioles make the trip to New York to face the Yankees! These are the two best teams in the AL and they have been battling for the best record all season in the entire MLB with the Phillies too. The Yankees also won the first game in this series. Our MLB odds series has our Orioles-Yankees prediction, odds, and pick for Thursday.\n\nLast Start: Pitched 5.2 innings and gave up four runs on nine hits with one walk and eight strikeouts in an Orioles loss.\n\nLast Start: Pitched five innings and gave up one run on four hits with four walks and six strikeouts in a Yankees win.\n\nThe Orioles come into this series with a 47-25 record and lost the first game in this series and it broke a two-game winning streak. Their offense has jumped into the top 10, while their pitching is the second-best in the MLB. The Orioles have so much young talent behind the plate with Jordan Westburg, Gunnar Henderson, Adley Rutschman, Anthony Santander, Cedric Mullins, Colton Cowser, and Ryan Mountcastle making up the bulk of it. They improved their pitching this past offseason by adding Corbin Burnes to go with Grayson Rodriguez, Cole Irvin, Kyle Bradish, and Albert Suarez. The Orioles were the best team in the AL last season and improved this season, at least on paper.\n\nThe Orioles are starting Cole Irvin on the mound and he has a 6-3 record, a 3.03 ERA, and a 1.23 WHIP. Through 68.1 innings, he has allowed 27 runs on 71 hits with 13 walks and 51 strikeouts up to this point in the season. The Orioles are 9-4 in his 13 appearances this season. Irvin has been great in one of the best pitching staffs in the MLB. He still has a difficult matchup against one of the best offenses in the MLB with the Yankees behind the plate.\n\nThe Orioles' offense has been one of the best in the MLB and has made a jump back into the top 10 of the MLB. They are 10th in team batting average at .249 after finishing last season at .259. The offense is led by Adley Rutschman and Gunnar Henderson leads the way in most batting categories. Adley Rutschman leads the way in batting average at .292, in 53 RBI, and in total hits at 82. Then, Henderson leads the way in home runs at 22 and OBP at .368. They get a very difficult matchup against Gil on the mound and how red-hot he has been for the Yankees.\n\nWhy The Yankees Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Yankees have been one of the best teams in the MLB with a 51-24 record. They are in the running for the best team in the MLB. They won the first game in this series and broke a two-game losing streak. Their bats have been great and their pitching is the best in the league. Juan Soto is a huge difference maker and an MVP-caliber player who was added to go with Anthony Rizzo, Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton, Anthony Rizzo, and Anthony Volpe behind the plate. Nestor Cortes, Marcus Stroman, Clarke Schmidt, Luis Gil, and Carlos Rodon have all been at varying levels of at least good to great on the mound.\n\nThe Yankees are starting Luis Gil on the mound where he has a 9-1 record, a 2.03 ERA, and a 0.98 WHIP. Gil has allowed 19 runs on 39 hits with 39 walks and 96 strikeouts through 80 innings. He has started in 14 games and the Yankees have gone 12-2 in those games. Gil is the best pitcher for the Yankees currently and is going to be a massive challenge for this Orioles offense, even with all their depth.\n\nThe biggest key for the Yankees is their offense. They are ranked eighth in the MLB currently in team batting average at .252 which is a massive improvement after struggling to .227 last season. Juan Soto has been a huge key player, leading in almost every batting category next to Aaron Judge. Soto leads the way in batting average at .313, in OBP at .436, and in total hits at 82. Judge then leads in home runs at 26 and in RBI at 64. This offense has a difficult matchup against Cole Irvin for Baltimore because he has been a big part of one of the best staffs in the league in Baltimore.\n\nFinal Orioles-Yankees Prediction & Pick\n\nThis is a huge matchup in the AL because both are fighting for the title of the best team in the MLB.

Entering the night with A 51-24 record, the Yankees had a golden opportunity to gain even more separation from the rest of the pack as they looked to improve their league-best win-loss tally. However, they came up just short after pulling off some heroics to send the game to extras, losing in the end by one run, 7-6.\n\nThe Yankees, however, wasted no time in making a roster move following the defeat to the Orioles on Wednesday. The current AL East leader has optioned relief pitcher Anthony Misiewicz back to Triple-A less than 24 hours after calling him up to the big-league roster, according to Yankees PR on Twitter (X).\n\nMisiewicz received his first trip to the major leagues on Wednesday and he pitched a very important ninth inning during their 7-6 defeat to the Orioles. He was called upon by manager Aaron Boone to try and keep the Yankees' deficit to just one run in the top of the ninth, and to his credit, he delivered.\n\nHowever, Anthony Misiewicz's inning of work did not go as smoothly as he would have hoped, but he got the job done regardless. The Yankees reliever got himself into a bases-loaded jam after he allowed a single to Jorge Mateo, a walk to Adley Rutschman and a single to Ryan Mountcastle, but he rebounded by striking out Austin Hays and then getting Anthony Santander to fly out to end the inning.\n\nThere is a bit of uncertainty yet as to who the Yankees will be calling up to replace Misiewicz's place in the 26-man roster. Fans are calling for Agustin Ramirez to be brought up to the majors, but he only recently arrived in Triple-A.\n\nMisiewicz will be remaining in the Yankees' 40-man roster, which opens the door for an eventual return to the big leagues should their other relievers continue to struggle. The 29-year old lefty is currently sporting a 3.23 ERA in 30.2 innings pitched for the Yankees' Triple-A affiliate, the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders.\n\nOrioles halt the Yankees' comeback bid\n\nThe Orioles played spoiler in Gerrit Cole's return; in Cole's very first inning of the 2024 season, the Orioles already put up a run on the board courtesy of a double from Ryan O'Hearn. Cole rebounded with an impressive second and third innings; during the former, he went three-up, three-down, and during the latter, he struck out the side even though he allowed a baserunner via walk.\n\nAfter Cole allowed a single in the fifth inning, the Yankees pulled him and called upon Ron Marinaccio to try and keep the score tied. Marinaccio's relief appearance immediately turned into a nightmare; he allowed the baserunner, Cedric Mullins, to steal second, and then he allowed the very first batter he faced, Ramon Urias, to launch a ball deep over the left-field wall to give the Orioles a 3-1 lead. Marinaccio also allowed another run-scoring double from O'Hearn to make it 4-1 Orioles.\n\nBut even though the Orioles took a 5-1 lead into 7th after they added to their lead with yet another run-scoring double, this time courtesy of Ryan Mountcastle, the Yankees had a lot of fight left in them. Giancarlo Stanton uncorked a monster three-run bomb to center field to cut the Orioles' lead to one, and in the bottom of the ninth, thanks to Anthony Misiewicz' escape act, the Yankees were able to tie the game thanks to another clutch hit from Stanton.\n\nAlas, the Yankees could not get the job done in the 10th; they ended up allowing two runs, with one crossing the plate due to a costly error, and then pinch-runner Oswaldo Cabrera was caught stealing, stopping the team's comeback bid in its tracks.\n\nTime to make some moves to improve the bullpen?\n\nThe Yankees have no major roster weaknesses, hence their place as the team with the best record in the MLB. But contending teams can never have enough elite bullpen arms if they were to compete for a World Series trophy.\n\nRon Marinaccio was sporting a 2.12 ERA prior to tonight's poor outing, but his peripherals (4.39 fielding independent pitching) suggest that this may not be too sustainable.

That seventh inning, just a couple of misplays or plays that we normally make and Stanton hits the big homer there. But in the end we made some plays and they made some plays, too.\n\n\"Really happy with how we battled, we competed. You can give up the lead and continue to fight offensively. It shows a lot about our club and it was a heck of a win.\"\n\nBaltimore is 4-2 against the Yankees this season. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, the Orioles can break a tie for the longest streak of series wins vs. division foes since divisions were created in 1969, having already equaled the mark shared by the Atlanta Braves (1998-2000), Milwaukee Brewers (1991-92) and Cincinnati Reds (1975, 1969-70).\n\nThe Yankees are attempting to avoid dropping a second straight series as they enter play Thursday with four losses in their past six games. New York, which has 14 victories in its past 20 games, has not lost consecutive series all season.\n\nPlaying without Aaron Judge on Wednesday, the Yankees finished with nine hits, eight of them after the fifth inning. Judge was held out as a precaution after getting hit on the left hand in the third inning on Tuesday by a pitch from Albert Suarez. The Yankees are unsure if he will sit again in the series finale.\n\n\"Seemed better but not much to report on over the last several hours and during the game,\" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. \"I would say (Thursday is) a maybe. We'll see how we look when we come in.\"\n\nYankees right-hander Luis Gil (9-1, 2.03 ERA) will start on Thursday, looking to join the Kansas City Royals' Seth Lugo and the Philadelphia Phillies' Ranger Suarez as the third 10-game winner in the majors this season. Gil is 9-0 with a 1.64 ERA over his past 11 starts and has allowed one run or none in nine of those outings.\n\nGil last pitched on Friday in an 8-1 win at Boston, when he allowed one run on four hits in five innings while throwing a career-high 104 pitches.\n\nGil pitched two-hit ball for 6 1/3 shutout innings to earn a win on May 1 in Baltimore. He is 2-0 with a 0.00 ERA in two career starts against the Orioles.\n\nLeft-hander Cole Irvin (6-3, 3.03 ERA) will get the ball for the Orioles. In his most recent outing, he yielded four runs (three earned) on nine hits in 5 2/3 innings during a 6-3 loss to the Atlanta Braves on June 13.\n\nIrvin did not face the Yankees when the teams met in Baltimore earlier this season. The left-hander is 0-2 with an 8.31 ERA in three career appearances (two starts) against New York.", "source": {"uri": "deadspin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadspin"}, "authors": [{"uri":

In fact, it's only been the two, with the O's losing the opener, 4-2, before winning in 10 innings last night, 7-6. The rubber match awaits here this afternoon.\n\nAmong the stakes in the game is the Orioles streak of series without losing one against an AL East opponent. That dates back to when they lost a series to the Yankees in April 2023. Ever since then, it's been all wins and splits. It's an impressive streak, tied at 21 series with the best such streak any team has ever managed in baseball's division history. (That's what I am pretty sure that I saw on a MASN graphic earlier in this series, anyway.)\n\nAn Orioles win would also be a big help for their hopes of eventually taking the division lead back from the Yankees. If the O's win, they'll be just a half game behind New York. A loss and they fall to 2.5 games back. Winning would also leave the Orioles in a strong position to end up with the head-to-head tiebreaker, in the case of the two teams finishing the regular season tied. The O's are 4-2 against the Yankees over their first six games this season. Improving to 5-2 would be a big edge with six games left to be played between the teams before season's end.\n\nWestburg is back in the lineup after he was weirdly run into by Juan Soto while Westburg was fielding a ground ball on Tuesday. Hopefully this is a sign that his bruised hip is actually better and not a matter of the player and team pushing him back in the lineup when he really needs another day or two.\n\nCole Irvin makes the start for the Orioles today. They could sure use him going at least six innings after Albert Su\u00e1rez and Cade Povich not going deep in either the previous two games, plus the game going into extra frames yesterday.\n\nLike Westburg, Judge has only missed one game. Based on media personality comments, it seems like the Yankees have spun themselves up into carrying a continuing grudge anyway even though it's their pitchers who've done way more hitting of and throwing at Orioles batters than the reverse this year.\n\nMaking the start for the Yankees is Luis Gil. No big deal, just the AL ERA leader. Just earlier this week, the Orioles offense put some solid ERA inflation on one of the NL ERA leaders, Zack Wheeler, so perhaps they can manage to do the same to Gil.

After a well-deserved off day, the Orioles are back in action tonight for a huge series with the New York Yankees. First pitch isn't for 12 hours and I don't know about you, but I'm already nervous.\n\nBefore yesterday, the Orioles hadn't had an off day since May 30. They played 17 games in 17 days. They had an eight-game road trip sandwiched between nine home games. They faced two division rivals and the top two teams in the NL East. And they went 12-5 in that stretch. They're good!\n\nI hope the team made the most of its off day because tonight they kick off a 13-game stretch without an off day that will take them through the end of the month. And it won't be an easy road, either. Because it's never easy, is it? In this stretch, the Orioles face not only the Yankees but also the first-place Cleveland Guardians and both underachieving Texas teams. Once the calendar turns to July the Orioles will have four straight Mondays off and the All-Star break.\n\nBut first, the Yankees. I would love if Corbin Burnes and Grayson Rodriguez were starting on the road against the team about the Orioles in the standings, but the three pitchers slated all have good upside. Albert Su\u00e1rez continues to defy expectations, Cade Povich is coming of a great start against Atlanta, and Cole Irvin's solid season has continued of late, even if he's not as dominant lately as he was earlier this year.\n\nIt won't be easy, though, especially because Yankee ace Gerrit Cole will be making his season debut on Wednesday, opposing Cade Povich. The Yankees' pitching has been good this year, and this will just make it tougher. But the Orioles have already handled plenty of good pitchers this year, so bring it on.\n\nLinks\n\nDrew French on John Means: \"Team first, very selfless guy\" - MASN Sports\n\nDrew French talks about pitcher injuries and the loss of John Means.\n\nScott Boras says his Orioles clients enjoy the winning environment in Baltimore - The Baltimore Banner\n\nScott Boras and David Rubenstein had a talk when the sale of the Orioles was final.

Feels...a little premature?\n\nBirthdays and History\n\nIs today your birthday? Happy birthday! You have two Orioles birthday buddies. Carlos M\u00e9ndez turns 50 years old today! He played in 26 games for the 2003 team. It was his only major league experience.\n\nAlso, a very happy birthday to Caleb Joseph. Joseph was with the Orioles from 2014-18, primarily as a backup catcher to Matt Wieters. He couldn't really hit but was (and I assume still is) a delightful human. He had his moments at the plate, though! Like in 2014 when he homered in five consecutive games. Baby's gotta eat! Joseph turns 38 years old today.\n\nOn this day last year, the Orioles defeated the Chicago Cubs 6-3 at Wrigley Field. They had 14 hits including three from leadoff batter Austin Hays. Anthony Santander hit his 10th home run. F\u00e9lix Bautista got his 19th save and the Orioles ran their record to 44-27. One year later they are three games better than that.\n\nIn 2011, the Orioles lost 4-2 to the Washington Nationals. Brian Matusz started. He gave up four runs in 5.1 innings and his ERA went from 5.11 to 5.60.\n\nIn 2007, the Orioles fired manager Sam Perlozzo and named Dave Trembley the interim manager. Trembley would later be named the permanent manager. My, how times have changed.\n\nAnd in 1995, the Orioles traded Andy Van Slyke to the Phillies for pitcher Gene Harris. If you don't remember Pirates legend Andy Van Slyke playing for the Orioles, don't worry. It was only 17 games.", "source": {"uri": "camdenchat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Camden Chat"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type":

That said, this page is updated frequently so make sure that you click on the link provided so that you're getting the most updated information.\n\nJordan Westburg went 2-for-4 with a home run, three RBI, and two runs scored on Sunday. One of the stories of the season, Westburg has been a revelation for Baltimore. The homer was his 11th on the season with 42 runs batted in and a .278 average while playing both second and third base. He's become a very good player very quickly.\n\nAnthony Rizzo was diagnosed with a fractured right arm following Sunday's collision at first base and is likely to miss 4-6 weeks, The Athletic reports. One wonders if Rizzo will have a job to come back to at that point. The Yankees will likely go with DJ LeMahieu at first and Oswaldo Cabrera at third for now. They'll be on the lookout for an upgrade at first prior to the trade deadline; fortunately, it shouldn't be hard to find better options.\n\nThe total has gone UNDER in 16 of NY Yankees' last 21 games played on a Tuesday.\n\nOrioles are 10-2 SU in their last 12 games on the road\n\nYankees are 9-3 SU in their last 12 games against an opponent in the American League\n\nOrioles are 15-4 SU in their last 19 games against an opponent in the American League\n\nTake the over.

Maybe. But, by now, you know my style, so stay with me for a bit. Our bankroll has been growing.\n\nYes, the Yankees are the best team in baseball right now and the only team with 50 wins. They will also be sending Nestor Cortes to the mound, and he's been stellar at home. When pitching at home this season, Cortes has a mere 1.77 ERA. That's dominant.\n\nJuan Soto is back in the lineup, and Aaron Judge is doing Aaron Judge things. He's batting .300 with 26 home runs, which is on pace to match and possibly eclipse his record-setting 62 home run MVP season.\n\nThose are just a few reasons to back the favorites in this game.\n\nNow, hear me out on the case for the underdogs tonight.\n\nMLB Best Bet Today\n\nThe Orioles are a frisky young team and just 1.5 games behind the Yankees in the AL East. This win would put them within half a game.\n\nThey will want this. Yankee Stadium is not an easy place to play, but it's worth noting that the Orioles have a better win percentage on the road this season (22-10) than they do at home (25-14). It's also worth noting that Baltimore has won three of four games played vs. the Yankees this year and that the Orioles have the second-best win percentage in MLB as away underdogs (6-3).\n\nAlbert Suarez takes the mound for the O's tonight.\n\nSuarez has been excellent in his seven starts for Baltimore this season, and he has allowed a minuscule .20 home runs per nine this season across 44 \u2154 innings pitched. He has an ERA of just 1.61, with a 35% ground ball rate and an 84% strand rate.\n\nBoth teams have been hitting well recently, but the Orioles have a league-leading 35 home runs in June and are, particularly good vs. left-handed pitching. The Birds have a .195 ISO vs. southpaws this season.\n\nLook for catcher Adley Rutschman to have success tonight vs. Cortes. The last time he faced Cortes on April 30th, he had a pair of hits, and he is hitting .420 vs. lefties this season.\n\nCortes allowed four earned runs in that game and took the loss.\n\nSo, there you have it. Will the Yankees (-155) win tonight? Maybe.\n\nBut it's not a sure enough thing to pay that juice. Give me the O's for plus money (+130).\n\nPick: Orioles Moneyline (+130)\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.\n\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem and wants help, call 1-800-GAMBLER.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Walk-Off Wagers: MLB Best Bets Today (Back the Orioles vs. the Yankees for Plus-Money Tonight).", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_piacenti@myrtlebeachonline.com", "name": "Jennifer Piacenti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yankee Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_behind", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Games behind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_played", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Games played"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Handedness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Residential_Housing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Residential Housing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/1c6rir/picture289354940/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/eac54b35-9152-408b-8a85-77ce16043c91", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659805", "eventUri": "eng-9659805", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 1902, "textEnd": 1912}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Injury news before Yankees vs Orioles game Thursday", "body": "Thursday afternoon's series finale between the Yankees and Orioles is much more than just a rubber match between two of the best teams in the American League.\n\nIt marks the potential return of Aaron Judge, who missed Wednesday night's game after being removed from the series opener Tuesday night when he was hit by a pitch on his left hand.\n\nMore: Yankees appear to get even for Aaron Judge, but the Orioles win the night\n\nYankees' fans had to hold their collective breath, given two days prior Dodgers' superstar Mookie Betts suffered a fractured left hand after being hit by a pitch and will likely be out until mid-August.\n\nFortunately, manager Aaron Boone said Judge is \"day-to-day\" and was \"hopeful\" he'd be back in the starting lineup this afternoon after avoiding a major injury.\n\nAfter a dreadful month of April where he sported just a .220 batting average with only six home runs, Judge has been on fire since. The former American League MVP has 20 homers and 46 RBI since the calendar flipped to May and has raised his batting average from .197 on May 2 to .302 nearing the end of June.\n\nEven with the early exit on Tuesday, Judge is still the overwhelming odds-on-favorite on sportsbooks in New Jersey at -125 (Bet $125 to win $100) to take home his second AL MVP award.\n\nThe series finale between these two AL East counterparts will feature a 4:05 p.m. first pitch at Yankee Stadium.\n\nAfter Wednesday night's contest was on Prime Video, today's game will be back on the YES Network.\n\nOn the mound for the Bronx Bombers will be none other than Luis Gil. The 26-year-old earned his ninth win of the season for the Yankees in a 8-1 victory at Fenway Park on June 14 against the Red Sox. Gil is currently the runaway bet with -185 odds (Bet $185 to win $100) to take home the AL Rookie of the Year as he's stepped up in a big way to start the year with the absence of ace Gerrit Cole.\n\nMLB: Yankees captain Aaron Judge's connection to Willie Mays\n\nFacing the Yankees will be Cole Irvin, who's been one of the Orioles most consistent starters this year. While the 30-year-old southpaw has been solid in 2024, it's notable that he's surrendered eight or more hits in all three starts so far in June and is 0-2 with a 8.31 ERA versus the Yankees in three appearances in his six-year career.\n\nCheck back here for the starting lineups for Thursday afternoon in the Bronx.\n\nThis article originally appeared on NorthJersey.com: Aaron Judge injury update:

But you can't escape the feeling that there's a whole lot on the line as the Orioles and Yankees face off for the next three games.\n\nThe O's, the second-best team in the American League, have the misfortune of sharing a division with the best team, the Yankees. The Birds, despite playing exceptionally well pretty much all season, still find themselves looking up in the AL East standings at the Yanks, who took over first place on May 15 and haven't loosened their grip since. They just keep winning, those jerks.\n\nNow the Orioles get the chance to take care of business themselves, just as they did when these two teams met in Baltimore from April 29-May 2. The O's won three of four games in that set, holding the high-octane Yankees offense to just six runs the entire series. That was before Aaron Judge really got going. At the end of that series, in which he went 1-for-13, Judge was batting just .197 with a .725 OPS. Literally the next day, he began the scorching hot streak that has continued ever since, one in which he's batted .387 with a 1.439 OPS and 20 home runs in 40 games. It would be asking a lot for the Orioles to cool down Judge again, and the one-two punch of Juan Soto and Judge is likely going to be a problem. It would behoove O's pitchers to negotiate the rest of the lineup without incident.\n\nBoth teams know what's at stake in this series. An O's sweep would vault them into first place, and at the very least a series win would keep them well within striking distance of the Yankees. Anything less and their AL East deficit will become a little bit larger, though by no means insurmountable with three months to play.\n\nAlbert Su\u00e1rez takes the mound for the opener as an unknown commodity to most of the Yankees. Having last pitched in the majors in 2017 before this year, Su\u00e1rez has faced only DJ LeMahieu (1-for-7) and Giancarlo Stanton (0-for-1) of the currently active Yankees roster. The Yankees counter with former Oriole Nestor Cortes, who faced the Birds in Baltimore earlier this season and took the loss, giving up four runs in six innings. Eight of the nine Orioles who were in that previous lineup will face Cortes again tonight, with Austin Hays (instead of Cedric Mullins) the only change.", "source": {"uri": "camdenchat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Camden Chat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_folkemer@camdenchat.com", "name": "Paul Folkemer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juan Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Su\u00e1rez_(baseball,_born_1998)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Su\u00e1rez (baseball, born 1998)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedric_Mullins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cedric Mullins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Albert Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Hays", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin Hays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giancarlo_Stanton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giancarlo Stanton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_LeMahieu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DJ LeMahieu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/War_and_Politics", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/War and Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zu8u3orECQjhlL9ijOTlnJX62co=/0x0:3000x1500/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25496827/2157499895.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659805", "eventUri": "eng-9659805", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "dateEnd": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 683, "textEnd": 697}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 471, "textEnd": 477}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

After working his way back he needed just three rehab appearances - allowing one earned run over 12.1 innings with 19 strikeouts and a walk while holding minor leaguers to a .136 average.\n\nOf course, the 33-year-old will rejoin a rotation that hasn't missed a beat without him. Yankees starters have pitched to an MLB-best 2.90 ERA over 419.0 innings, second-most in baseball.\n\nCole hasn't had the best luck against Baltimore in the last two seasons. Over five starts in 2022 and 2023, he has pitched to a 4.09 ERA and 1.121 WHIP over 33 innings with 29 strikeouts.\n\nThe calendar still says June, but this series has huge postseason implications, especially after the Yanks (50-24) dropped two of three in Boston and the Orioles (47-24) took two out of three from the NL-leading Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nNew York has three games in hand over the Orioles in the win column, but the lead in the division is down to 1.5.\n\n\"It's a really good team,\" Aaron Boone said. \"They're very complete... They have a versatile and dynamic offense. They can beat you with power. They can beat you with speed. They can match up against you. They got a few guys they platoon with that are impactful against the other hand. So they're a complete team, no doubt.\"\n\nThe Orioles had the Yankees number the first time these two met in early spring, taking three out of four and holding the Bombers to just six runs on 22 hits. The good news for the Yanks is they won't face any of the starters - who pitched to a 1.16 ERA in the series - will feature this time around.\n\nWith just under 90 games to go these three days in June won't end anybody's season, but could be a big boost with a month to go before the All-Star break.\n\nBut Boone is looking big picture: \"It's a marathon. That cliche is very true: we got a long way to go in all of this. All we can say right now is both teams are really good, really dangerous and with a lot of potential.\"\n\nDingers! Dingers!\n\nThe pitching is really good, but there still could be a lot of home runs in this series.\n\nNew York has the two best individual hitters in the series in Juan Soto and Aaron Judge, but the O's beat them in the home run department 114 to 110.\n\nThe series could come down to if the Yankees big home run trio of Judge (26), Soto (18) and Giancarlo Stanton (17), who account for over half of their dingers, can out-hit Baltimore's aggregate attack.\n\nThe Birds are led by superstar-in-the-making Gunnar Henderson with 22, but have six other players with nine home runs or more compared to the Yanks' four. Anthony Santander (17), Adley Rutschman (14), Ryan Moutncastle (11) and Jordan Westburg (11) all have pop and left-handers Colton Cowser and Ryan O'Hearn who can take advantage of the short porch in right.\n\nOf course, Judge does love hitting against Orioles pitching: 39 homers and 85 RBI with a .302/.431/.686 slash for a 1.118 OPS in 99 career games.\n\nOne inning doesn't define a full season, but sometimes it can epitomize the problems - and also be a harbinger of things to come.\n\nDown 4-3 in the seventh on Sunday, the Yankees loaded the bases with nobody out. But the 7-8-9 hitters in order left them loaded. The Sox then scored three in the bottom half to blow the game wide open en route to a 9-3 win.\n\nGleyber Torres (batting .222 with a .631 OPS), Oswaldo Cabrera (.237 and .625), and DJ LeMahieu (.188 and .491 in 15 games) are all struggling to produce. (The latter two will now see more time as the struggling Anthony Rizzo is set for an extended period on the IL.)\n\nBut really to add more balance to the lineup, it will fall on Anthony Volpe and Alex Verdugo will need to put up better than slightly above-average numbers (both are 110 wRC+ and 106 and 108 OPS+, respectively).\n\nAfter the Boston Red Sox set a franchise record with nine stolen bases in Sunday's series finale.\n\n\"We have to do a better job of controlling those things,\" Boone said. \"I have a lot of confidence in us controlling the running game. Today we didn't get it done.\"\n\nThere is concern that the slow pop time to second base (averaging 2.08 seconds, second-to-last in MLB) and weak arm (71.3 mph, last in MLB) of catcher Jose Trevino could be something teams look to continue to exploit.\n\n\"Gotta make better throws,\" Trevino, who took full responsibility for the steals, said. \"Gotta get the ball out. They're gonna run. We knew that coming in, so I just gotta put the ball on the bag.\"\n\nThe Orioles don't have many players with the top-end speed that can match the fleet-footed BoSox, but putting runners in motion has been part of their identity.\n\nIn the series in Baltimore, Austin Wells was behind the plate in three games and was successful in getting both would-be base stealers at second.\n\nTrevino's bat will likely keep him in the lineup and he's still a fine defensive catcher and leads MLB in catcher-framing runs with six. (Wells is tied for third with four.) But they will need to do some creative work to stop the crime wave on the bases.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

I just didn't know the teams would take that description quite so literally.\n\nThe O's lost the opener to the Yankees, 4-2, after their starting pitcher and their offense both short-circuited, but it was a pretty gruesome game on both sides. By the fifth inning, four different players had been battered, bruised, and bloodied. And we've still got two more games to play.\n\nThe carnage began in the top of the first inning with Adley Rutschman, who took a hard dive back into second base on a pickoff attempt and then came up with a bloody nose that required a visit from the trainer. Rutschman stayed in the game, and the Orioles' two first-inning singles went for naught as Yankees starter Nestor Cortes escaped the jam.\n\nIn the bottom of the inning, the Yankees put together an identical rally to the Orioles' -- runners at first and second, one out -- after Juan Soto walked and Aaron Judge singled. Just like Cortes, Albert Su\u00e1rez worked out of it, but not without a cost. On Giancarlo Stanton's grounder to the left side, Soto collided with Jordan Westburg as he tried to field the ball. Soto was ruled out for interference, but he knocked Westburg out in the process, with the O's third baseman removed from the game with left hip discomfort. Soto! (shakes fist) Come on, man. This is why we don't just barrel recklessly into fielders. Let's hope Westburg is OK.\n\nOh, there's more. Su\u00e1rez opened the bottom of the third with a four-seam fastball that ran in too far on Judge, drilling him in the hand. Oof. You hate to see that, too. Judge was clearly in pain as the trainers checked him out at first base, and while he initially stayed in the game, he was pinch-hit for an inning later. The Judge injury, understandably, cast a gloomy pall over the crowd of 47,429 at Yankee Stadium. As of this writing there have been no updates about Judge's status.\n\nAnd we're still not done. The fifth inning began with yet another Orioles pitcher missing badly inside and drilling a batter in the hand, this time Keegan Akin landing a fastball on Gleyber Torres's pinky finger. You see what I mean about this game turning unexpectedly violent. Torres, at least, was able to stay in the game, but the Yankees were none too happy with the wildness of O's pitchers. Yeah, neither were the Orioles.\n\nWhen players weren't getting hurt left and right, the Yankees were putting a figurative hurting on the Orioles, particularly Su\u00e1rez, who stumbled through the worst outing of his O's career. Only once in his first 14 outings had Su\u00e1rez allowed more than two runs, and he'd gotten through at least four innings in every previous start, but that ended tonight. The right-hander simply had no command, issuing a galling five walks and six hits in just 3.2 innings of work. The Yankees tallied their first run in the second inning on an Anthony Volpe RBI single, then tacked on two more in the third when the first four batters reached base.\n\nBy the time Su\u00e1rez walked the bases loaded in the fourth, Brandon Hyde had seen enough, as had we all. Su\u00e1rez has otherwise been a sensational out-of-nowhere find for the Orioles this season, but his first experience at Yankee Stadium was not a good one. Keegan Akin helpfully stranded all three inherited runners to somewhat salvage Su\u00e1rez's pitching line, but gave up a run of his own in the fifth.\n\nMeanwhile, Cortes was cruising. The Yankees left-hander, once a short-lived Orioles Rule 5 pick, has a long history of dominating the Birds, entering with a career 4-1 record and 2.45 ERA against Baltimore. The new and improved O's offense had hit him a little better in his most recent outings against them, but you wouldn't know it tonight. He was shutting down Orioles hitters like it was 2020-21 all over again.\n\nAfter the top of the first, the O's never managed even two baserunners in one inning against Cortes, who threw everything but the kitchen sink -- cutters, four-seamers, changeups, sliders, sweepers -- to easily dispatch one batter after another. He retired 10 batters in a row at one point, and the Orioles didn't get another man in scoring position until the sixth, only for nifty plays by the Yankees' middle infielders to keep him stranded. Also, after the Judge and Torres HBPs, Cortes fired an up-and-in fastball that knocked down Gunnar Henderson. The Yankee Stadium crowd reacted with cheers and applause, which is gross.\n\nThe Orioles at least made Cortes work for 105 pitches in six innings, which isn't much consolation when you don't score any runs. Relievers Michael Tonkin and Luke Weaver each pitched a scoreless inning, which included Ram\u00f3n Ur\u00edas getting picked off first base with the O's down by four runs in the eighth, like, what are we doing here, Ram\u00f3n?\n\nThe Birds' offense finally showed signs of life in the ninth, when it was far too late to matter. Against Yankees closer Clay Holmes, pitching in a non-save situation, Henderson led off with a single to extend his league-leading on-base streak to 25 games in a row. Anthony Santander followed with a laser-shot home run into right field, the first dinger that Holmes has given up all season. That cut the Yankees' lead to 4-2, but Holmes easily dispatched the next three hitters to finish the game.\n\nBleh. The Yankees were, by every measure, the better team in this game. But we've seen the O's bounce back from rough losses before. They've got two more games to show the Yankees what they're made of.", "source": {"uri": "camdenchat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Camden Chat"}, "authors": [{"uri":

After splitting the first two games of their three-game set this week, the Orioles remain just 1.5 games behind the Yankees.\n\nWhen two teams are division rivals and fighting for the same prize, there tends to be a lot of bad blood. There's certainly been no love lost between the two sides this week, as they've resorted to a beanball war.\n\nBaltimore threw the first punch during its 4-2 loss on Tuesday, hitting two New York batters (Aaron Judge and Keegan Akin) with pitches. The Yankees retaliated on Wednesday, drilling Gunnar Henderson and Colton Cowser.\n\nThe Orioles' broadcasting crew was not happy after Henderson got plunked by reliever Victor Gonzalez in the top of the seventh, calling out New York on the air for perhaps intentionally targeting the AL MVP candidate.\n\nJudge was visibly upset during his postgame interview on Tuesday after getting beaned and missed Wednesday's game with a hand injury, so it was only a matter of time before Yankee pitching evened the score. As Baltimore's best player and leadoff man, Henderson was an easy target.\n\nUnfazed, the 22-year-old reached base three times for the Orioles and scored two runs, helping his team to a 7-6 victory in 10 innings. More importantly, he showed great discipline, poise and composure by not escalating the situation.\n\nKnotted at 1-1, this critical series will end on Thursday afternoon after a tense couple of days. Baltimore will try to win the rubber game behind Cole Irvin (6-3, 3.03 ERA), while New York will turn to star rookie Luis Gil (9-1, 2.03 ERA).

In addition, it's seen its AL East lead shortened to just 1.5 games. That makes this series even more critical as Baltimore on their tail, having gone 8-2 in its last 10 games.\n\nRead on for my free Orioles vs. Yankees predictions and MLB picks for Tuesday, June 18 featuring a chance to make some money before this game even goes final.\n\nThe wrong team is favored here. A big reason is that the Baltimore Orioles have a significant advantage on the mound. With that in mind, I'm isolating some of this game and playing the first five innings moneyline.\n\nNestor Cortes will take the mound for the New York Yankees tonight, and there are some troubling metrics for him in this matchup. He was always going to regress from what we saw last season, and that's happened, seeing jumps in his expected batting average and barrel rate, amongst other items.\n\nThe key metric is how hard Cortes has been hit this season. He'll enter today with a rating that places him at the Bottom 20% of the sport in hard-hit rate and against a lineup like Baltimore, that is a significant concern.\n\nBaltimore will come in today with the best hard-hit rating in baseball and the second-best barrel rate. That makes them the only team in baseball amongst the Top 3 in both metrics. It also gives them a serious argument for the most potent offense in baseball, a title they'd compete directly with New York for. Getting them at plus money against a pitcher who has had issues giving up the hard-hit ball is difficult to pass on, and I won't do it.\n\nIf you look back at some of the worst games Cortes has had, they have, unsurprisingly, come against teams who hit the ball hard:\n\nThat's three of the five times he's allowed four earned or more this season, coming against teams that rank in the Top 10 of both metrics. I see no reason why the Orioles don't have a similar performance against Cortes to the one they had earlier this year.\n\nAdley Rutschman is one of the best hitters in baseball against left-handed pitching and he'll see one tonight in Cortes, so we're pairing him with our best bet.\n\nRutschman will enter today with the second-best batting average against left-handers in baseball, along with a Top-25 isolated power rating. He's among the few players in the sport in the Top 25 of both metrics, making him a perfect fit for this matchup.\n\nOutside of that, Rutschman has excellent power. He is fifth overall in hard-hit rate among the Orioles but comfortably above the league average. With that in mind, he should be well-suited to attack Cortes' main weaknesses.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nThe Yankees have covered the run line in 29 of their last 40 games (+22.55 Units / 48% ROI).

While he has to face a lefty-lefty matchup with Cortes on the bump, he's thrived in that spot, posting a .291/.424/.557 slash line against lefties this season.\n\nAaron Judge: Aaron Judge has been dominant this season, especially since the start of May. The former league MVP has been hitting .372 since May 1, and he comes into Tuesday's clash leading the American League in doubles, home runs, walks, slugging percentage, OPS, OPS+, and WAR.\n\nPretty good, huh?\n\nThe O's will look to keep Judge out of the hit column for just the second time in his last 10 games.\n\nThis is just the seventh start of the season for Suarez, who has also come out of the bullpen, but he's been extremely effective for the O's posting a sub-2.00 ERA and a 2.79 Fielding Independent Pitching.\n\nWhile I don't want to base this play strictly on him, I think Suarez is good enough to keep the O's in this game before handing things over to their bullpen, which ranks third in MLB with a 3.20 ERA this season.\n\nThe Orioles do have a key advantage on offense, as they rank third in MLB in OPS against left-handed pitching. That should make things tough on Cortes, who has led the Yankees to just a 6-9 record in his 15 outings in 2024.\n\nNew York has been the best team in baseball to this point of the season, but I'm backing the O's to at least cover the run line in this one.\n\nBaltimore is an impressive 11-2 on the run line as an underdog, and I think it can chase Cortes early on to potentially win this game outright.\n\nPick: Orioles +1.5 (-162)\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yankee Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_Cole", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gerrit Cole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_independent_pitching_statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defense independent pitching statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wins Above Replacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3600,h_2025,x_0,y_34/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j0nwbypfd378945xf9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659805", "eventUri": "eng-9659805", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 1331, "textEnd": 1336}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The Orioles! They did it again last night, with \"it\" in this case meaning that they played a game where a lot of awesome stuff happened, and also a lot of annoying and terrible stuff, with the game frustratingly going into extra innings after a Craig Kimbrel blown save, and with all of us in agony over how they were going to blow it in extra innings and let the Yankees win.\n\nThat's what it felt like, and then, they just... didn't blow it. The Orioles scored two tenth inning runs and although New York got its own Manfred Man across the plate in the bottom half of the inning, that wasn't enough. Dillon Tate closed it out as the O's won again. That's win #48 on the season, with the team now on pace for a 107-win season. They are back to 1.5 games behind the Yankees for the AL East lead.\n\nNotably satisfying in the middle of all of the drama was the fact that the whining loser Yankees intentionally hitting Gunnar Henderson burned them, their classless fans cheering the HBP and then briefly silenced after Henderson scored an ultimately crucial fifth Orioles run on a line drive misplayed by Juan Soto, who started all of this by weirdly running into Jordan Westburg on a routine ground ball on Tuesday.\n\nAfter all of that, the Orioles come into this afternoon's game against the Yankees needing a win to keep their remarkable \"consecutive series against division opponents without a loss\" streak alive, the new streak that has become the interesting one since the regular season sweepless one ended. The O's haven't lost a series against the AL East since these same Yankees beat them in April 2023. The streak ends unless the O's win this one.\n\nThere's no reason to think that they can't, except for our accumulated life experiences of the Orioles playing the Yankees, which have not been erased even as the O's went 7-6 against New York a year ago and even though they're 4-2 against the Yankees this year. They won a pressure-filled game last night where so many winds were blowing against them and they still did the darn thing.\n\nAlso, the regrettably (for me) excellent Luis Gil is making the start for the Yanks. Though it was annoying when Gil stymied the O's about six weeks ago, he's been on a crazy run since then and has a 2.03 ERA for the season. Cole Irvin, set to start the 4:05 game for the Orioles, has been pretty good overall. After watching Albert Su\u00e1rez and then Cade Povich walk a bunch of dudes, I hope Irvin can find some success and not hand out free passes.\n\nOh yeah, and even though it feels like it happened two days ago now, the Orioles announced before Wednesday's game that Kyle Bradish had Tommy John surgery. So now we can all really, really get to thinking about who might get traded and what that trade might bring back in terms of quality players who can help the Orioles win the AL East and advance in the postseason.\n\nOrioles add Maton to active roster and option Stowers (School of Roch)\n\nSome roster movement yesterday that wasn't connected to the Bradish news, with Norfolk infielder Nick Maton getting the call and Kyle Stowers sent back to the minors. This is probably connected to Jordan Westburg's bruised hip. Connor Norby was not eligible to return without an injured list placement.\n\nJim Palmer has COVID, causing him to miss MASN broadcasts (The Baltimore Sun)\n\nGet well soon, Jim! I'm hoping I can take a summer vacation this year without developing COVID while I'm on the trip, which happened to me each of the last two years. The virus still sucks.\n\nSome Jackson Holliday rookie cards pay tribute to infamous Billy Ripken card (The Baltimore Banner)\n\nApparently, you might be able to get your hands on a Jackson Holliday card where the knob of the bat says \"fun face.\" Being the particular kind of nerd I am, I'm reminded of when Dragon Ball Z was initially dubbed for the American audience and they changed garb that said \"HELL\" to read \"HFIL\" - which was called, in the dubbed dialogue, the Home For Infinite Losers. They could have just said Yankee Stadium.\n\nSeth Johnson is the Orioles prospect who's ready to climb the ladder (MLB Pipeline)\n\nThe folks at MLB Pipeline have a prospect with every team who's due for a promotion. They think Johnson, who the Orioles got as part of the three-team Trey Mancini trade in 2022, is due.\n\nHappy 29th birthday to F\u00e9lix Bautista! I'm looking forward to his return next season more than ever. A number of former Orioles were also born on this day: 2019-21 pitcher Thomas Eshelman, 2011-12 pitcher Kevin Gregg, 2008 infielder Juan Castro, 2007 catcher Paul Bako, 1985 pitcher Phil Huffman, and 1962-75 catcher Andy Etchebarren.\n\nIs today your birthday? Happy birthday to you! Your birthday buddies for today include: actor Errol Flynn (1909), Beach Boys co-founder Brian Wilson (1942), musician Lionel Ritchie (1949), and actress Nicole Kidman (1967).\n\nIn 1631, the village of Baltimore - that is, the Irish one - was attacked by Barbary pirates, resulting in a sack that saw more than 100 residents carried off to become galley slaves.\n\nIn 1863, West Virginia was admitted to the United States, becoming the 35th state of the Union.\n\nIn 1944, the American navy scored a decisive victory over the Japanese after the second day of the Battle of the Philippine Sea, which saw the American forces sink three Japanese carriers and destroy over 500 aircraft.\n\nIn 1972, President Richard Nixon had the conversation that later became the subject of a suspicious 18.5 minute gap in tape recordings after his involvement in the cover-up of the Watergate break-in was revealed.\n\nIn 1975, Jaws was released in theaters. The movie went on to become the highest-grossing film of all time. Today, Jaws doesn't even crack the top 50 (all of whom grossed over $1 billion,) but if you count only North American box and adjust for inflation, it's seventh, with an adjusted gross of $1.4 billion - behind The Ten Commandments and ahead of Doctor Zhivago.\n\n**\n\nAnd that's the way it is in Birdland on June 20.

Mandatory Credit: John E. Sokolowski-USA TODAY Sports / John E. Sokolowski-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAm I crazy to be fading the winningest team in baseball at home? Maybe. But, by now, you know my style, so stay with me for a bit. Our bankroll has been growing.\n\nYes, the Yankees are the best team in baseball right now and the only team with 50 wins. They will also be sending Nestor Cortes to the mound, and he's been stellar at home. When pitching at home this season, Cortes has a mere 1.77 ERA. That's dominant.\n\nJuan Soto is back in the lineup, and Aaron Judge is doing Aaron Judge things. He's batting .300 with 26 home runs, which is on pace to match and possibly eclipse his record-setting 62 home run MVP season.\n\nThose are just a few reasons to back the favorites in this game.\n\nNow, hear me out on the case for the underdogs tonight.\n\nMLB Best Bet Today\n\nThe Orioles are a frisky young team and just 1.5 games behind the Yankees in the AL East. This win would put them within half a game.\n\nThey will want this. Yankee Stadium is not an easy place to play, but it's worth noting that the Orioles have a better win percentage on the road this season (22-10) than they do at home (25-14). It's also worth noting that Baltimore has won three of four games played vs. the Yankees this year and that the Orioles have the second-best win percentage in MLB as away underdogs (6-3).\n\nAlbert Suarez takes the mound for the O's tonight.\n\nSuarez has been excellent in his seven starts for Baltimore this season, and he has allowed a minuscule .20 home runs per nine this season across 44 \u2154 innings pitched. He has an ERA of just 1.61, with a 35% ground ball rate and an 84% strand rate.\n\nBoth teams have been hitting well recently, but the Orioles have a league-leading 35 home runs in June and are, particularly good vs. left-handed pitching. The Birds have a .195 ISO vs. southpaws this season.\n\nLook for catcher Adley Rutschman to have success tonight vs. Cortes. The last time he faced Cortes on April 30th, he had a pair of hits, and he is hitting .420 vs. lefties this season.\n\nCortes allowed four earned runs in that game and took the loss.\n\nSo, there you have it. Will the Yankees (-155) win tonight? Maybe.\n\nBut it's not a sure enough thing to pay that juice. Give me the O's for plus money (+130).\n\nPick: Orioles Moneyline (+130)\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_piacenti@si.com", "name": "Jennifer Piacenti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Mountcastle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Mountcastle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adley_Rutschman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adley Rutschman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_Centre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rogers Centre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yankee Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_behind", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Games behind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juan Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_played", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Games played"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Residential_Housing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Residential Housing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2545,h_1431,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j0mt5gb6bbdttdz1tt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659805", "eventUri": "eng-9659805", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 2236, "textEnd": 2246}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

At the time there was consideration to a fourth rehab game in the minor leagues but it also coincided with the Yankees playing the Orioles in about as big of a series as baseball will see for the final days of spring and a few weeks before the All-Star break.\n\nThe Yankees officially made the announcement about Cole's return from right elbow inflammation Monday and penciled him in for the middle game of the three-game series with the Orioles, putting him potentially inline to start against the Mets next week.\n\nStill it had the feel of a spring training outing and one anyone would understand the Yankees for doing when Cole threw 62 pitches in four-plus innings. There was no exact amount but anyone knew a typical 100 pitches was off the table since his last outing facing major league hitters occurred in the opening days of March.\n\nBack then Cole dealt with some scary moments, thinking the worst about the elbow injury, which seems to be sending one pitcher after another out of commission this season. There was the second opinion he sought in Los Angeles to get the good news of it being inflammation and not anything worse and a little over three months later, he was warming up for a team with 51 wins in 75 games and in first place since May 14.\n\n\"We'll build him conservatively here to get him built up,\" manager Aaron Boone said about three hours before his ace warmed up to a montage of his highlights on the video board. \"And, frankly, with all our guys we'll kind of see where they're at and what we feel like makes the most sense. But I don't necessarily think it'll be extra moving forward. It'll just be conservatively getting [the pitches] up. But, then again, listening to each start, too, to see where he is.\"\n\nBy the time Cole finished fine-tuning himself against the second-best team in the American League, his outing was an afterthought in some regards because of how the rest of the night unfolded with a playoff type feel, though seeing the proper location of his pitches was reassuring for the ace.\n\n\"It was kind of a special game for me,\" Cole said. \"It's just been a long few months. A lot of emotions, so I wasn't too sure how I was going to feel out there. Locating the ball always quells the nerves a little bit, you know?\"\n\nThere was the matter of the Yankees hitting Gunnar Henderson and Colton Cowser in the seventh and eighth inning. It did not seem to be a set of purpose pitches but the possibility existed because Aaron Judge was hit in the hand by Albert Suarez in the third inning during a routine Yankee win in the series opener.\n\nJudge's injury cast a pall of anxiousness similar to his 2018 broken wrist and similar to Juan Soto exiting during a rain delay on June 6 due to forearm inflammation. It also created the thought process of some about how someone on the Orioles must pay with a pitch to the ribs or worse but Cole was not going to engage in those tactics, especially given where he still is in terms of building up.\n\nAnd although there were numerous opportunities to use Judge as a pinch hitter, the Yankees never came close to actually doing so, reminding everyone this is still June and if this was October the situation would be significantly different.\n\nThe outcome of Cole's season debut reminded everyone there's a long way to go before the Yankees engage in what they hope is a thrilling postseason that ends with their first title since 2009.\n\nStill there was an acknowledgment on both sides about the type of game it was, notably from the Orioles.\n\n\"It's a big win,\" Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde said. \"You know things were going well and then they weren't. That seventh inning, just a couple of misplays or plays that we normally make and Stanton hits the big homer there. But in the end we made some plays and they made some plays too.\n\n\"Really happy with how we battled, we competed. You can give up the lead and continue to fight offensively, it shows a lot about our club and it was a heck of a win.\"\n\nHyde's words were even more emphasized in how the defense was described, notably a throw by Adley Rutschman to get the Yankees out trying to steal second.\n\n\"That was the throw of the year right there, a big spot,\" Hyde said.\n\nAnd the Orioles and Yankees figure to meet in a few more games of the year the rest of the way, featuring all sorts of big spots and potential for big moments.\n\n\"It was a heck of a game against a heck of a team,\" Boone said.\n\nAnd it was the perfect summation of what will likely be the best divisional race in the sport. While Cleveland leads the AL Central by 5 1/2 games, the Mariners are owners of a nine-game lead. In the NL, the Phillies hold a seven-game edge, the Brewers are 7 1/2 games ahead and the Dodgers own a nine-game lead.\n\nCertainly, those leads can be overcome but the saga between the Yankees and Orioles has a more chapters left in a sprint to avoid playing in the wild-card round.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He was deemed unavailable, still trying to get the swelling and pain out of his left hand after being drilled Tuesday by O's starter Albert Suarez.\n\nThere's a chance Judge is in Thursday's lineup, but they could have used him Wednesday.\n\nInstead, the rarely used Jahmai Jones pinch-hit for Trent Grisham and flied out with the bases loaded to end the sixth.\n\nAnd in the 10, after Ben Rice's sac fly cut the lead to a run, another potential spot for Judge came up.\n\nThat's when Jones struck out looking with the tying run at first base to end it, after pinch-runner Oswald Cabrera was gunned out trying to steal second by the superb Rutschman.\n\n\"Kind of a special game'' for Gerrit Cole\n\nNow, the Orioles (48-25) have taken four of six games this year from the Yankees (51-25), with Luis Gil pitching Thursday to prevent Baltimore from taking another series.\n\nEntering Wednesday, the Yankees were charged up by the sight of Cole's return, following three months of rehabbing from right elbow nerve irritation.\n\n\"Kind of a special game for me a little bit,'' said Cole, who had \"a lot of emotions'' as he climbed the Stadium mound for the first time since claiming last year's AL Cy Young Award.\n\nBut he was limited in his pitch count (62), exited a 1-1 game in the fifth and watched Ron Marinaccio quickly hand Baltimore a 4-1 lead.\n\nYankees appear to retaliate against the Orioles\n\nIt was still 4-1 in the seventh, when Henderson absorbed Gonzalez's first pitch with one out and none on base.\n\nThat was more than suspicious, but no warnings were issued.\n\n\"Tried to execute a good pitch inside, and it slipped out,'' Gonzalez said through an interpreter.\n\nNo doubt, the Orioles processed that message on the field and answered back with more runs.\n\nHenderson didn't look pleased by Gonzalez's pitch, but he soon stole second base off Jose Trevino and Tommy Kahnle and scored on Ryan Mountcastle's double.\n\nYankees' comeback falls short\n\nGiancarlo Stanton tried bashing the Yankees back from there, with a 440-foot three-run homer to center in the seventh, and a sharp game-tying RBI single in the ninth.\n\nThat scored Anthony Volpe, who led off with a double against Baltimore closer Craig Kimbrel, but the O's tallied twice in the 10 off Holmes.\n\n\"I know I'm better than what I've been the last three (appearances) or so,'' said Holmes, and everyone chimed in again about the collective need to improve against the stolen base.\n\nMeanwhile, remember these dates...\n\nJuly 12-14 at Baltimore and especially September 24-26 in the Bronx, when the division title could be on the line, with Cole unharnessed from pitch limits and Judge up there swinging.", "source": {"uri": "app.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The Orioles and Yankees are the top two teams in not only the American League East, but the junior circuit at large. And if you dig into the numbers enough, you can pretty easily make an argument for these being the finest offenses and pitching staffs in the entire sport. There's still plenty of season to go from here, but what happens at Yankee Stadium this week will, at the very least, have a big impact on vibes in the immediate future.\n\nYou will note that this is not the first time that these teams will face off this season. The Orioles took three out of four from the Yankees during a series that ran from April 29-May 2 at Camden Yards. Since then, the two teams have both been on fire. And importantly, for the Yankees anyway, Aaron Judge has emerged from his early-season funk to become the frontrunner for MVP in the AL.\n\nNew York boasts a powerful, but somewhat top-heavy, lineup, led by Judge. His numbers are cartoonish, featuring a .299/.425/.686 line with a league-best 26 home runs and 210 OPS+. Juan Soto is right behind him with a .315/.433/.592 line that includes 18 home runs and a 189 OPS+.\n\nThere are several other big contributors on the New York offense, but the drop-off is steep. After Soto's 1.025 OPS, the next highest is Giancarlo Stanton and his .776 OPS. Stanton is also third on the team with 17 home runs. Anthony Volpe is their well-rounded shortstop that has a .728 OPS, 15 stolen bases, and stellar range at shortstop. He's a tier (or two) below Gunnar Henderson and Bobby Witt Jr., but a good player all the same. Outfielder Alex Verdugo (108 OPS+) and catcher Jose Trevino (116 OPS+) give the lineup some depth.\n\nNew York will be without Anthony Rizzo for a while as he suffered a fractured arm in the series finale against the Red Sox on Sunday. He had been struggling in June (.373 OPS), but brought a good veteran presence to the infield. DJ LeMahieu will probably take over his innings at first base in the meantime. Other familiar names that will not play in this series are pitcher Clarke Schmidt (lat strain), pitcher Nick Burdi (hip), and infielder Jon Berti (calf).\n\nOne area of New York's roster that could use an upgrade is its bullpen. Their 4.19 xFIP is in the bottom third of MLB. That is a reflection of their sub-par strikeout rates (8.53 K/9) and walk rates (3.87 BB/9). Their closer, Clay Holmes, is the closest thing they have to a lockdown reliever, but he has struggled a bit since the end of April and is posting the lowest strikeout rate of his career. Michael Tonkin's 0.81 ERA is lovely, but his 3.62 xFIP is less so. Even if the O's are trailing late, there should be opportunities to come back.\n\nRHP Albert Su\u00e1rez (3-0, 1.61 ERA) vs. LHP Nestor Cortes (3-5, 3.59 ERA)\n\nSu\u00e1rez makes his fifth straight appearance as a starter. Over his last four games he has a 1.40 ERA/2.74 FIP with 16 strikeouts and eight walks over 19.1 innings. Opponents are hitting just .214 in that time and he has not allowed any home runs. In fact, Su\u00e1rez has given up just one home run all season long. This powerful Yankees lineup will be his stiffest competition yet.\n\nThis will be Cortes' second time facing the Orioles this season. Back on April 30 he allowed four runs on eight hits, two walks, and five strikeouts over six innings. The southpaw has not been particularly good so far in June with a 4.86 ERA over three starts and a .894 OPS against, but he is coming off of a seven-inning, two-run outing against the Royals last week.\n\nLHP Cade Povich (0-1, 4.76 ERA) vs. RHP Gerrit Cole (season debut)\n\nWhat a spot for Povich to make his third career start. He was brilliant against the Braves last time out, keeping them off the board while striking out six over six innings. Suddenly, the Orioles will need to count on the rookie a lot more with so many veteran arms on the IL. At the same time, expectations should be tempered, and the Orioles need to put him in a position to succeed. Facing the top of the Yankees order three times might be out of the question here, but it will all depend on how he is looking.\n\nCole's return is huge for the Yankees, who have actually gotten steady production from their rotation in his absence. Reporting indicates that Aaron Boone won't push his ace beyond 80-85 pitches in his first big league start of the season. He maxed out at 68 pitches during his rehab, so that makes sense. That could also be a break for the Orioles, who should be able to get to the bullpen relatively early if things go well.\n\nLHP Cole Irvin (6-3, 3.03 ERA) vs. RHP Luis Gil (9-1, 2.03 ERA)\n\nIrvin has come back to earth a little bit in the month of June. Over three starts (17.2 innings) he has allowed nine runs (seven earned) on 25 hits, two walks, and 15 strikeouts. His contact-oriented approach does not feel like an ideal matchup against these Yankees, but he has made many of us look foolish with his output to this point in the season. Hopefully he can continue his effective, finesse approach this time out as well.\n\nGil may be the favorite for AL Cy Young right now. He has been terrific so far, posting a 198 ERA+ and striking out 96 over 80 total innings. Walks continue to be an issue though, no one has issued more than his 39 free passes, but he has limited all other damage to such a degree that it doesn't really matter. He tossed 6.1 shutout innings against the Orioles back on May 1, New York's only win in the series.", "source": {"uri": "camdenchat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Camden Chat"}, "authors":

More than a third of the way through the season they are, amazingly, on pace to win even more games than last year's AL-leading 101. Their biggest problem comes from the Bronx, where the Orioles begin a three-game series tonight: The Yankees are projected to win even more, at least 105 games, and with it the division and AL's best record.\n\nSome O's fans will contend that the Bombers are bound to cool off. Don't count on it. This Yankees team has seen the emergence of brilliant young stars like Anthony Volpe at shortstop and starter Luis Gil (6-0 with 0.70 ERA in May) along with established greats like Aaron Judge and Juan Soto. Add great pitching depth and a versatile bench, and you sense a Yankees team on its way to a truly special season.\n\nFor example, while the Orioles offense has been tremendous, first in runs per game in the MLB, they have an on-base-plus-slugging of .761, but the Yankees' OPS is a bit better at .767. The Orioles' pitching also has been terrific, getting brilliant starts from journeymen like Cole Irvin and Albert Su\u00e1rez. But the Yankees hurlers have been better, and are No. 1 in the MLB with a 3.02 ERA, while the O's are No. 2 at 3.07.\n\nPlus the Yanks haven't even had their ace Gerrit Cole yet this season; he is scheduled to rejoin them sometime in June following rehabilitation from an elbow injury. This year's NYY squad also has a new shutdown closer in Clay Holmes with electric stuff. Meanwhile, O's veteran closer Craig Kimbrel has been inconsistent and rarely overpowering even when getting outs.\n\nAnd so, as amazing as the Orioles have been so far, they must get better to have a good chance of winning the division and/or beating the Yankees in a postseason showdown.\n\nFirst, the Orioles must acquire a dominant closer to help the overworked bullpen. The argument in favor of the O's trading for Mason Miller of the Oakland A's is very compelling, since Miller routinely throws over 100 mph with a 1.35 ERA in April. Another lights-out closer worth considering in a trade would be the Cardinals' Ryan Helsley.\n\nSecond, the Birds must shore up their starting rotation, which has lost John Means, Tyler Wells (and now possibly Kyle Bradish) for the season and just getting Dean Kremer back from injury. One answer could be rookie Cade Povich who has made good starts his first few times out recently. But a trade for another proven starter will also be necessary.\n\nFinally, the O's must improve their lineup, which has suffered most of the year by relying on left fielder Austin Hays, who even with much better production recently, is still slugging a measly .365. He has looked lost at the plate for the equivalent of a full season -- since the middle of last year -- showing few signs as a right-handed pull hitter of having the power needed to hit balls over the super-deep Great Wall of Baltimore. For now, if he cools off again the O's should send Hays down to AAA to get him everyday at-bats and try to right the ship. Meanwhile, they should either trade for a better-hitting righty outfielder or promote one of their many talented AAA youngsters.\n\nSending down such a well-loved veteran like Hays will be painful, but is probably necessary to seize the rare opportunity this team has. Led by a stunningly consistent nucleus of young position players -- Gunnar Henderson at short, Adley Rutschman catching, Jordan Westburg at third, and Colton Cowser and Kyle Stowers in the outfield -- these baby birds are flying high. Just another boost or two could help them soar right into the World Series.\n\nNow is the time for Mike Elias and colleagues to make the tough choices needed to compete with New York, win the AL, and get to the Big Dance. The question is: Does the Orioles leadership have the guts to pull the trigger on such difficult decisions? I'm betting yes.", "source": {"uri": "baltimoresun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Baltimore Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type":

It was the first clunker of the season for Gil, as even after the performance he still has an ERA of just 2.77. He very well could be headed for his first All-Star Game selection also.\n\nThe streak really was incredible for New York as it pointed to consistently solid performances from starters and also meant that the Yankees weren't saddled with any early injuries as well. These two facts have helped limit bullpen usage and has certainly helped contribute to New York having the best record in the league through 76 games.\n\nAt the time of this posting, the Yankees trail the Orioles 8-1. If New York goes onto lose, they'll fall to 51-26 and will only be 0.5 games ahead of the Orioles in the American League East.\n\nIt's a difficult week for New York in terms of the schedule.

The upstart Baltimore Orioles come to the Bronx, sitting just a game and a half out of first place in the AL East.\n\nMeanwhile, New York will be without its manager, via Jomboy Media.\n\n\"Brad Ausmus will manage tonight's Yankees game, per @JimBowdenGM,\" they tweeted via their Talkin' Yanks account. \"Aaron Boone told us yesterday that he'd be missing tonight's game to attend his son's graduation.\"\n\nAusmus, the Yankees' bench coach, was drafted by the team in 1987 as a catcher. After working his way up the minor league system, he enjoyed an 18-year MLB career with the San Diego Padres, Detroit Tigers, Houston Astros, and Los Angeles Dodgers. The three-time Gold Glove winner managed the Tigers from 2014-17, and the Dodgers in 2019. After bench coaching the Oakland Athletics in 2022, he landed back in New York this season, where it all started.\n\nAusmus will be tasked with navigating a questionable first base situation after Anthony Rizzo's injury. Minor league prospect Ben Rice was called up in his place and will get a chance to prove himself in the big leagues. D.J. LeMahieu is a veteran option, but he is no longer reliable. The 35-year-old is hitting just .188, with no homers and four RBI.\n\nHow will the Yankees rebound after two straight losses in Boston?\n\nThis will be one of the Yankees' most important series of the season\n\nThere aren't too many legitimate championship contenders across the league this year. The Yankees, Dodgers, Orioles, and Philadelphia Phillies all have the talent to get it done, but the list is short after that. There are only eight other teams above .500, with the Cleveland Guardians, Seattle Mariners, and Milwaukee Brewers at the top of that group. However, those squads don't have the same level of depth as the top four.\n\nWith Baltimore being one of New York's only true challengers this season, it'll be paramount for the club to win the home series and maintain its slim division lead. The Orioles beat the Yankees 3-1 in their four-game series at Camden Yards earlier this year.\n\nBoone sounded off on the significance of the series, via the Associated Press's Noah Trister.\n\n\"I think both teams have clearly established themselves as really formidable, but at the same time, it is a marathon. We've got a long way to go,\" New York manager Aaron Boone said. \"I think right now all I can say is both teams are really good, really dangerous and have a lot of potential.\"\n\nBaltimore has the league's third-best record, at 47-24. This battle of heavyweights will also see the return of reigning Cy Young Award-winner Gerrit Cole, who's slated to start Wednesday for the Yankees.\n\nWhile there's plenty of season left, whoever wins this three-game tilt will have the inside track on the AL East crown.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The reigning AL Cy Young Award winner was still not quite built up - limited to just 62 pitches - but showed flashes of his vintage self despite allowing two earned runs on three hits and a walk over four innings.\n\nCole struggled in the first, allowing a leadoff double to Gunnar Henderson and an RBI double to Ryan O'Hearn. But the right-hander responded with a 1-2-3 second inning and then struck out the side in the third (which also included a walk to Henderson).\n\nHe struck out two more in the fourth, bringing his total to five on the night, but was lifted in the fifth after a leadoff single to Cedric Mullins.\n\n-Cole was attributed another run when Ron Marinaccio came in relief and immediately allowed Mullins to score on a two-run home run by Ramon Urias.\n\nThat was not the only blemish for Marinaccio, who entered the game with score tied at 1-1. The right-hander also allowed a single, walk and a double for the Orioles to go up 4-1 before he finally got out of the fifth inning.\n\n-Alex Verdugo saved the Yankees in the top of the ninth with an incredible defensive play that would have scored three runs and blown the game open. With the bases loaded and Anthony Santander at the plate, the Orioles slugger ripped a line drive to deep center field but Verdugo ran full speed and made the catch before crashing into the wall to end the inning.\n\nVerdugo appeared a little banged up on the play but ultimately walked off the field and stayed in the game.\n\n-Giancarlo Stanton continued to make his case for the All-Star Game on Tuesday with two clutch hits late in the game. In the seventh inning, Stanton crushed a 440-foot, three-run home run to narrow the score to 5-4.\n\nBut he was not done there. In the ninth, Stanton ripped a game-tying RBI single to left field with an exit velocity of 120 mph, scoring Anthony Volpe from second base as the Yankees forced extras.\n\n-After Aaron Judge was forced to leave Tuesday's game after being hit by a pitch in the left hand, the Yankees appeared to send a message to the Orioles. Yankees reliever Victor Gonzalez hit Baltimore star shortstop Gunnar Henderson in the right arm with a fastball in the seventh inning.\n\nHenderson took his base without any theatrics while the Yankees fans erupted in applause. Of course, it backfired putting Henderson on base as the Orioles extended the lead to 5-1 with a Ryan Mountcastle RBI double off of Tommy Kahnle later in the inning.\n\nHad the Yankees pulled thorugh perhaps it would be Stanton, instead it's the Orioles outfielder. Mullins went 2-for-5 and came through when it mattered most in the tenth inning, hitting a go-ahead RBI single to put Baltimore up 6-5 and giving them a needed insurance run by swiping third base, which resulted in a throwing error and allowed Mullins to score.\n\nThe Yankees wrap up their three-game series agains the Orioles on Thursday at 4:05 p.m. ET.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_Cole", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gerrit Cole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunnar_Henderson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gunnar Henderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yankee Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extra innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cy Young Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Mountcastle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Mountcastle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedric_Mullins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cedric Mullins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Santander", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Santander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Verdugo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Verdugo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Stanton_(left-handed_pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Stanton (left-handed pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_velocity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exit velocity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Kahnle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Kahnle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giancarlo_Stanton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giancarlo Stanton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_by_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hit by pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Error (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/sny_articles_235/2e5c8f41f01dfb8070fdba0fc0e6d693", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659805", "eventUri": "eng-9659805", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

The Orioles' offense proving relentless. Giancarlo Stanton doing damage. Batters plunked by pitches with questionable intents. Comebacks, stiff-arms and remarkable plays as the two best teams in the American League battled for supremacy.\n\nIf Wednesday were a preview at what Yankees-Orioles showdowns will look like for the rest of the season and perhaps postseason, it was a fun one -- and ultimately a disappointing one for the home crowd.\n\nThe Yankees roared back from a four-run hole beginning in the bottom of the seventh and sent the contest into extra innings, but the Orioles tagged Clay Holmes for a pair of runs in the 10th in a 7-6 Yankees loss in front of a sellout crowd of 47,155 in The Bronx.\n\nThe Yankees (51-25) dropped just a sixth game in their past 20 and watched their AL East lead get shaved to 1 \u00b9/\u2082 games before Thursday's series finale.\n\nAfter a thrilling seventh, eighth and ninth innings -- which included four Stanton RBIs that gave the Yankees life -- Holmes and Jose Trevino folded in the fateful 10th.\n\nHolmes, pitching for a second straight night, allowed a bloop single to Cedric Mullins that scored the ghost runner for the go-ahead run.\n\nMullins advanced to second on Alex Verdugo's throw home and then swiped third, with Trevino -- whose throwing arm suddenly has become a large problem -- throwing the ball into left field to add a tack-on run.\n\nThat would be enough for the Orioles, who finally put the Yankees away in the bottom of the 10th. DJ LeMahieu flared a single into center against Dillon Tate.\n\nBen Rice lined a would-be hit into right field, but a diving Anthony Santander took the hit away and turned it into a sacrifice fly.\n\nWith Trevino up, Baltimore catcher Adley Rutschman did what Trevino could not: throw out a runner at second base.\n\nPinch-runner Oswaldo Cabrera was nailed trying to advance into scoring position.\n\nTrevino then walked before Jahmai Jones -- taking the at-bat on a night Aaron Judge apparently was unavailable -- was punched out to end it.\n\nThe best development for the Yankees was Cole, shelved all season with nerve inflammation and edema, successfully retaking the mound and pitching into the fifth inning.\n\nThe reigning American League Cy Young Award winner appeared to get sharper as his outing lengthened, finishing with four-plus innings in which he was charged with two runs on three hits, a walk and five strikeouts.\n\nThere were worse developments.\n\nTrevino, in his first start since the steal-fest Sunday in Boston, allowed four more stolen bases that were not close.\n\nThe Yankees' offense was kept quiet until the seventh inning.\n\nAnd the Yankees' possible attempt at retribution may have backfired.\n\nA night after Judge was drilled in the hand with a fastball that kept him out of the lineup, the Yankees may have responded beginning in the seventh inning.\n\nVictor Gonzalez threw a first-pitch, 94.2 mph fastball that hit Baltimore star Gunnar Henderson in the back of the shoulder.\n\nThe crowd cheered, and Henderson calmly took first base.\n\nBut if the pitch were thrown with intent, the Yankees surely did not intend what came next.\n\nHenderson stole second then scored the Orioles' final run of the night on a triple from Ryan Mountcastle.\n\nThat run loomed large when the Yankees' offense awoke in the seventh inning.\n\nA few soft singles from Anthony Volpe and Juan Soto put two on for Stanton, who demolished a three-run home run against Baltimore fireballer Yennier Cano to bring the Yankees within one -- the one-run gap a result of the possible retribution.\n\nIn the eighth inning, another Oriole was plunked -- Colton Cowser, who slammed his bat down -- this time by Caleb Ferguson, but no warnings or ejections were issued.\n\nThe Orioles threatened to add on in the eighth, when they loaded the bases against recent call-up Anthony Misiewicz.\n\nWith two out, Santander crushed a deep drive to right-center on which makeshift center fielder Alex Verdugo made a tremendous over-the-shoulder catch before smashing into the wall.\n\nGiven momentum, the Yankees temporarily ran with it.\n\nAgainst Craig Kimbrel in the ninth, Volpe smacked a double before Stanton obliterated an RBI single at 120 mph that sent the game to extra innings, but that was where the momentum halted.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Yankees (51-24) opened a six-game homestand with a 14th win in their past 19 games and opened a hyped showdown against the rising juggernaut from Baltimore with crispness.\n\nAgainst an offense from the Orioles (47-25) that entered having scored the most runs in baseball, Cortes -- with velocity spikes that perhaps showed he was raising his game against this level of opponent -- scattered five hits and walked none in six strong frames that lowered his ERA to 3.36.\n\nThe Yankees provided the lefty a one-run lead in the second that would be enough for Cortes, who was at his best in the big moments.\n\nHe allowed two to reach with one out in the first, but stranded them by retiring Gunnar Henderson and Anthony Santander in succession.\n\nIn the sixth, Cortes received his loudest round of applause by throwing a 94.6 mph fastball -- his second-hardest pitch of the game -- up and in to Henderson, who spun safely out of the way.\n\nIf this were a response to Judge (and Torres, who was drilled in the hand, too), it only represented a threat, with no pitch plunking an Orioles batter.\n\nTorres then helped Cortes out by stealing a hit from Henderson with a dazzling dive to his left and a throw to first base, which moved Santander to second base before a passed ball moved him to third.\n\nBut again, Cortes rose to the moment and induced an inning-ending ground out from Santander on a night the Orioles went 0-for-5 with runners in scoring position.\n\nWithout Judge for the final five innings, the Yankees finished with just six hits -- but several were timely.\n\nAnthony Volpe drove a two-out, RBI single in the second to knock in Austin Wells and give the Yankees a lead that would not be threatened.\n\nTwo innings later, the Yankees loaded the bases on Judge's HBP, and he came around to score following singles from Alex Verdugo and Giancarlo Stanton.\n\nCall-up Ben Rice knocked his first career hit, a rope into right field, to load the bases before Torres' sacrifice fly added the Yankees' third run.\n\nAnother sac fly, this one off DJ LeMahieu's bat in the fifth, concluded their scoring.\n\nMichael Tonkin and Luke Weaver pitched scoreless innings before Clay Holmes surrendered a two-run shot to Santander, but that was all the Orioles could scratch across.\n\nThe closer clinched a victory that was as authoritative as it was concerning.", "source": {"uri":

Below we will continue our MLB odds series with an Orioles-Yankees prediction and pick. We will also let you know how to watch the game.\n\nLast Start: vs. Atlanta Braves: 6 innings, 5 hits, 0 runs, 0 walks, 6 strikeouts\n\n2024 Road Splits: 1 start, 5.1 innings pitched, 5 hits, 6 runs, 4 walks, 2 strikeouts\n\nCade Povich had a rough start in his MLB debut, but you can chalk that up to nerves. Povich was lights out in his second start, though. That was against a good offense in the Atlanta Braves, as well. He was able to shut down the Braves for six innings, and help the Orioles win that game. Povich proved he has what it takes, and he needs to do that again against the Yankees. If he can carry that start into this one, the Orioles will be able to come away with a victory.\n\nIn his two starts, despite giving up 10 total hits, Povich has an average exit velocity of 83.8. He does not allow a lot of hard contact, so teams are getting a little but lucky off him. Along with that, he has an xBA of .201, which is 26 points lower than his actual oBA. Those hits are going to stop falling at some point, and Povich will be dominant when that happens. As long as he keeps Aaron Judge and Juan Soto contained, the Orioles should win this game.\n\nWhy The Yankees Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nGerrit Cole is making his season debut in this game, and that is great news for the Yankees after there was some worry preseason. Having Cole back just makes the Yankees that much better. In his last rehab start, Cole struck out 10 over 4.1 innings. His stuff is back to being elite, and that is going to show in this game. What was even more impressive is Cole did not walk a single batter in his three rehab starts. His command is very good, and his stuff is elite. Do not expect him to go deep into this game as I am sure the Yankees will be closely monitoring his pitch count, but Cole should be his normal self.\n\nThe Yankees have a great offense this season. They are seventh in batting average, third in slugging percentage, second in home runs, first in barrel percentage, and third in average exit velocity. To go along with that, the Yankees rarely chase pitches, and they do not whiff a lot. Their offense is clicking in all facets of the game, so this going to be Povich's toughest matchup of his young career. As long as they keep hitting, the Yankees will win this game.\n\nFinal Orioles-Yankees Prediction & Pick\n\nIt is the long-awaited season debut for Gerrit Cole, and I am not expecting him to be any different. I think he will pitch like the Cy Young he is and lead the Yankees to a win. I will take New York to win this game straight up.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_zunkel@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Cameron Zunkel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_Cole", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gerrit Cole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_velocity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exit velocity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juan Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cy Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (baseball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Orioles-vs.-Yankees-prediction-odds-pick-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659805", "eventUri": "eng-9659805", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

{"uri": "8183554871", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-06-18", "time": "12:08:43", "dateTime": "2024-06-18T12:08:43Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-06-18T12:08:02Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5647059082984924, "url": "https://blogs.fangraphs.com/top-of-the-order-yankees-orioles-race-heats-up-as-deadline-looms/", "title": "Top of the Order: Yankees-Orioles Race Heats up as Deadline Looms", "body": "Welcome back to Top of the Order, where every Tuesday and Friday I'll be starting your baseball day with some news, notes, and thoughts about the game we love.\n\nNo division race is tighter than the AL East, with the Yankees leading the Orioles by just 1.5 games ahead of their three-game matchup that begins tonight in the Bronx. Both teams are virtual locks to make the playoffs, but securing the division title is crucial because of the almost-certain bye that would come with it. This is a fierce race that looks like it'll go down to the wire, but these head-to-head games might not be as important for their divisional hopes as their off-the-field showdown leading up to the trade deadline.\n\nWhile the Orioles and Yankees won't have much overlap in terms of trade needs -- and as such won't be competing for many of the same players -- they're obviously competing to get better and build more complete rosters so they can outlast the other and make a deep October run. The thing is, considering there are only five teams right now that are out of the playoff picture -- the White Sox, Marlins, Athletics, Rockies, and Angels -- actual upgrades available on the trading block might be in short supply. That means the Yankees and Orioles will need to capitalize on whatever improvements they can make. This environment could set the stage for New York and Baltimore to be among the most active teams over the next month and a half.\n\nThe Yankees have arguably the two best hitters in the entire league in Aaron Judge and Juan Soto, and though the rest of the lineup is good, it doesn't inspire nearly as much confidence. Anthony Volpe's flattened swing path has helped him cut down on his strikeout rate and spray more hits to the opposite field, but this month his strikeout rate is back up to 27% and he hasn't walked since May 30. Alex Verdugo has been solidly above average and stabilized left field, which had a cavalcade of players come through last year, and Giancarlo Stanton's streakiness has worked itself out to a 121 wRC+ and 17 homers, even though his on-base percentage is below .300. The catching duo of Jose Trevino and Austin Wells has come around too, though Trevino's throwing issues were firmly on display on Sunday, when the Red Sox stole nine (!) bases against him.\n\nAnd then there's the triumvirate of underperforming infielders: Anthony Rizzo, Gleyber Torres, and DJ LeMahieu. I'd be shocked if Torres didn't keep his job; after an anemic start, his bat has started to come around (112 wRC+ since May 12). But LeMahieu hasn't hit much at all since signing his six-year deal before the 2021 season, and Rizzo has struggled for a full calendar year now, though at least some of his 2023 woes can be attributed to the post-concussion syndrome that caused him to miss the final two months of last season. Further complicating matters is Rizzo's latest injury, a fractured right arm that won't require surgery but will keep him out for an estimated four to six weeks, according to The Athletic. In the short-term, the Yankees are expected to play Oswaldo Cabrera at third and LeMahieu at first, with catcher/first baseman Ben Rice likely to replace Rizzo on the roster. A bat like Rockies third baseman Ryan McMahon would go a long way toward lengthening the lineup while also improving the defense.\n\nThe Orioles, on the other hand, have gotten strong production up and down the lineup, with the exception of Cedric Mullins, who has made up for his offensive struggles with excellent defense. But their pitching -- widely viewed as a strength coming into the offseason -- has been hammered by injuries.\n\nThe Yankees weathered the loss of Gerrit Cole with aplomb -- so much so that I'm not sure they'll need to be in the market for starting pitching, even as Clarke Schmidt is expected to be out for a while with a lat strain. Cole is slated to be activated and make his season debut tomorrow night. Meanwhile, the sheer quantity of Orioles starters on the IL all but necessitates making an acquisition on that front. Dean Kremer will be back soon from triceps tightness, but Tyler Wells and John Means are out for the year, and Kyle Bradish could be destined for the same fate. He recently landed on the IL for a second time this year with a sprained UCL in his elbow. That leaves AL Cy Young frontrunner Corbin Burnes, Grayson Rodriguez, and Kremer as the top three starters of a playoff rotation, with the revelatory Albert Su\u00e1rez and Cole Irvin right behind and rookie Cade Povich potentially pushing for a spot as well.\n\nThere would certainly be worse playoff rotations around the league, but the O's would be doing a disservice to their deep offense if they neglected to improve their starting pitching, especially after they failed to address last year's rotation before the deadline and then were pounded by the Rangers and swept out of the ALDS. Their wealth of position player depth in the minor leagues should allow them to add at least one or two of the top available starters: Garrett Crochet, Erick Fedde, Tyler Anderson, Cal Quantrill, and Jes\u00fas Luzardo.\n\nThe one mutual need for the Yankees and Orioles is where all teams overlap at the deadline: the bullpen. Both teams have excellent back-end duos -- Baltimore has Craig Kimbrel and Yennier Cano, while New York boasts Clay Holmes and Luke Weaver -- but there's a steep dropoff after that. The shallow seller's market ought to create a lesser supply of available relief arms, which would likely inflate the cost that teams would ask for in return. This is where the strength of the New York and Baltimore farm systems (both of which are excellent) really come into play. These two organizations can afford to overpay for a third high-octane reliever -- such as Carlos Est\u00e9vez, Tanner Scott, Michael Kopech, and perhaps even Mason Miller -- without sacrificing their long-term outlook.\n\nThe final distinction is the two teams' disparate payroll situations. While it doesn't appear as if the Yankees have any restrictions for this season -- and the pursuit of keeping Soto surely will be unaffected -- owner Hal Steinbrenner certainly sounds like a man who wants to decrease payroll from the $302 million it's at this season. Next year's payroll is already at $182 million, and that's before factoring in arbitration raises to key players like Trevino, Schmidt, and Nestor Cortes -- not to mention the exorbitant price that'll be required to re-sign Soto. Torres and Verdugo are also set to hit free agency this offseason, and the current payroll figure for 2025 doesn't include what it will cost either to bring them back or backfill their positions. That could make them less interested in trading for players on guaranteed contracts beyond this season, even those who would fit well, like McMahon.\n\nOn the flip side, the Orioles have an extraordinary amount of flexibility under new owner David Rubenstein, who hasn't publicly commented on specific payroll plans but essentially can't do anything but spend more than the Angelos family did in the last several years of its ownership. Huge raises are coming for Adley Rutschman, Gunnar Henderson, Ryan Mountcastle, Bradish, and others, but Baltimore has a paltry $2 million committed to next season. That should give GM Mike Elias carte blanche to acquire anyone he wants at the deadline no matter how many years of club control the player has remaining, provided he's willing to give up the necessary prospects.\n\nAll of this will play out over the next six weeks before the deadline. In the meantime, the battle for the AL East begins in earnest tonight.", "source": {"uri": "blogs.fangraphs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "blogs.fangraphs.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

His fastball velocity was up at its normal heights during his rehab assignment, which saw him spin 12 1/3 innings of one-run ball with 19 strikeouts, and he continued to display expert command of the zone with no walks over the course of his outings.\n\nCole will meet a Baltimore Orioles team which has been good of late but very inconsistent, considering they've produced a spicy Isolated Power over .200 in the last two weeks but one which has come along with a strikeout rate near 24%. Given their strikeout rate and swing rate are both in the Top 10, we can safely classify Baltimore as a free-swinging bunch and reasonably project Cole to pitch deep enough in this game even on a pitch count.\n\nWith his strikeout prowess still incredibly evident, I think there's an easy way in for him to dominate Baltimore, just as he dominated almost about every opponent amidst his Cy Young Award-winning 2023.\n\nThe New York Yankees, meanwhile, will likely be without Aaron Judge here after he was hit by a pitch on the hand Tuesday, which will mean one of the worst hitters in baseball - Trent Grisham - will take his place in the outfield. The Yankees have been below .500 with Grisham in the lineup, due to the overwhelming delta between him and Judge or Juan Soto, and that should set things up nicely for Cade Povich.\n\nThe left-hander pitched a bit better than his line would indicate in his major-league debut, with walks ultimately doing him in. While this has been an issue for the prospect throughout his career, he did make it through six scoreless in his second start against Atlanta without issuing a free pass and generating more ground balls to boot.\n\nI believe in the left-hander's talent, and believe in him enough here to back the Under in a game which should feature some brilliance from Cole.\n\nIt's time to get a little creative here when it comes to this parlay given the pitcher-friendly nature I'm expecting here, and with the lines available on the total. I'll pay up for the 8.5 here with the eight runs unavailable as a parlay option, but to juice up the odds I'll be adding an additional leg.\n\nWe know Cole should dominate in the strikeout department given the recent run of form from the Orioles and his stellar rehab appearances, so let's move over to Povich. He did strike out six Braves over six frames last time out and put up a very impressive 32.5% punchout rate down in Triple-A this season, so I have no doubts about him hitting this alternative number. New York's been trending in the wrong direction with a 22.3% strikeout rate over the past week, has hit worse versus lefties, and will now be missing Judge on top of all that.\n\nI do like Jose Trevino in this lineup, however. He's quietly caught fire at the plate, hitting over .300 in his last 10 games, which even includes some pinch-hit appearances.

New York is 51-25 while Baltimore is 48-25. The Yankees have a 2.5 game lead in the division with Baltimore occupying the first wild card spot.\n\nGiancarlo Stanton had a game-tying single in the bottom of the ninth inning to force extra-innings for the Yankees. It eventually ended up not mattering as the Yankees lost but it was still a great moment for a heavily scrutinized player.\n\nStanton is having a very weird season as he has been productive at the plate (18 homers, 45 RBI), but really struggles getting on base (just a .301 OBP). That combination has put him in a position to accomplish something that has never happened before in Yankees history.\n\nPer @JayHayKid of the \"Baseball is Dead\" podcast:\n\nGiancarlo Stanton currently has a .301 OBP and a .494 SLG.\n\nHe'd be only the 3rd qualified player in the Wild Card era to have a season with a .500+ SLG and an OBP below .300, along with Rougned Odor in 2016 and Mike Jacobs in 2008. No Yankees player has ever done it.\n\nAll it would take for Stanton to get that slugging percentage over .500 is just a few more homers or a few more doubles.\n\nThe 34-year-old has 420 lifetime homers and also has 1,076 career RBI.\n\nThe Yankees and Orioles will play again at 4:05 p.m. ET on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giancarlo_Stanton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giancarlo Stanton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Stadium_(1923)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yankee Stadium (1923)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Jacobs_(first_baseman)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Jacobs (first baseman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rougned_Odor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rougned Odor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Guides", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5163,h_2904,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/fastball/01j0tvspb59sbqtbgm80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659805", "eventUri": "eng-9659805", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 157, "textEnd": 164}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

The two runs generated by Mullins were just enough for Dillon Tate in the bottom half, as the right-hander allowed the automatic runner to score but stranded the potential tying run for his first save of the season.\n\nKimbrel's blown save wasn't his typical one, as the veteran closer didn't walk a batter and often mixed in his knuckle curveball. Instead, Anthony Volpe and Giancarlo Stanton simply got the best of Kimbrel, the latter with a game-tying 120 mph single, but the 35-year-old closer gave up just the one run to give Mullins the opportunity for his heroics.\n\nLong before the excitement and angst of extra innings, youngster Cade Povich grinded through 4 2/3 innings, allowing only one hit and one run, to give the Orioles' offense a chance to bounce back from Tuesday's intense defeat.\n\nThe rookie southpaw didn't get the win, but his performance gave the Orioles' offense time to build a lead -- one just big enough for Baltimore's bullpen to stave off a fierce comeback attempt from the Yankees until it couldn't.\n\nRam\u00f3n Ur\u00edas' go-ahead two-run homer in the fifth was sandwiched between two RBI doubles by Ryan O'Hearn in the first and fifth. Ryan Mountcastle's RBI double to score Gunnar Henderson, who was hit by a pitch in his shoulder to further foment the animosity bubbling underneath this pivotal series, provided a key insurance run in the seventh.\n\nAfter Orioles pitchers hit two batters Tuesday, the Yankees threw up and in twice to Baltimore batters, including once to Henderson. New York then plunked two Orioles batters Wednesday, but the one to Henderson backfired. The 22-year-old shortstop stole second and scored on Mountcastle's double to right field to make it 5-1.\n\nIn the bottom half, Stanton clobbered a 440-foot home run off sinkerballer Yennier Cano to bring the Bronx Bombers within one, driving in two runners who reached base off left-hander Cionel P\u00e9rez.\n\nBaltimore is 48-25 and 1 1/2 games behind the American League East-leading Yankees (52-15). The win keeps the Orioles' streak of 21 straight AL East sets without a series loss alive, at least until Thursday. The streak is tied for the longest in MLB history since divisions were introduced in 1969.\n\nThe Orioles have gone 48-23 against the AL East during the streak, including 18-7 this year. The last time Baltimore lost an AL East series was versus New York in early April 2023.\n\nHyde didn't care that Povich's third MLB start would come under the brightest of lights at Yankee Stadium.\n\n\"I like watching Povich pitch wherever -- lights or no lights,\" Hyde quipped before Wednesday night's game.\n\nHyde just wanted to see his young starting pitcher command his six-pitch mix the way he did last week versus the Atlanta Braves. Povich didn't, as the southpaw walked four batters in his first two innings in what appeared to be an ugly, short start.\n\nBut Povich showed Hyde -- and the Yankees -- something even more than what's to be expected from a 24-year-old making his first career start in the Bronx.\n\nThe lone hit the Orioles' top pitching prospect allowed came to the first batter he faced, Volpe. He then issued two free passes and nearly walked in a run, but he worked out of the self-induced jam, giving up only one run on a sacrifice fly by Gleyber Torres.\n\nHe walked two more in the second but escaped that pickle, too, and then retired nine in a row before walking Juan Soto with two outs in the fifth. Hyde pulled him for right-hander Jacob Webb, whose success versus the Yankees continued Wednesday with a scoreless inning.\n\nOrioles executive vice president and general manager Mike Elias spoke highly of Povich before the game.\n\n\"The bumps and bruises and adjustments are very likely ahead of him, and we understand that, but he had that game against the Braves, now he's in Yankee Stadium,\" Elias said. \"This is a pretty big stage for him. I think he's a really good talent. He's got six pitches. He's got a real nice delivery.\"", "source": {"uri": "capitalgazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Capital Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_calvin_meyer@capitalgazette.com", "name": "Jacob

There's gonna be watchful eyes on him because we certainly want Gerrit Cole for the entire season. This is a great first step.\"\n\nWednesday's start is set to come about three months after Cole was diagnosed in spring training with inflammation and edema in his right elbow. He resumed playing catch on April 8 and returned to throwing off of a mound on May 4.\n\nCole then made three minor-league rehab starts between June 4 and last Friday, pitching to a 0.73 ERA with 19 strikeouts and zero walks over 12.1 innings. The first two outings came with Double-A Somerset.\n\nIn his third rehab appearance, Cole totaled 10 strikeouts over 4.1 innings for Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Friday, throwing 70 pitches.\n\n\"I feel really good today, and I felt really good last night,\" Cole, 33, said Saturday in Boston.\n\n\"It feels like it's coming together,\" he said. \"The closer and closer you get, the more excited you get.\"\n\nA typical progression would see Cole throw 80-85 pitches on Wednesday as he continues to build his pitch count back up at the MLB level.\n\n\"The main thing is you want to get him through it healthy,\" Ausmus said. \"Certainly, we want to win the game. ... But with Gerrit Cole, I think the big picture [is] we want him the entire year.\"\n\nCole's return adds to a major boost to a Yankees starting rotation that entered Tuesday's series opener against the Orioles in the Bronx with a 2.90 ERA -- the best among MLB staffs.\n\nNow in the fifth season of a nine-year, $324 million contract with the Yankees, the right-handed Cole pitched to a 15-4 record, a 2.63 ERA and 222 strikeouts over 209 innings in 2023 en route to his first Cy Young Award.\n\nHis return comes against an Orioles team that entered Tuesday only 1.5 games behind the Yankees in the AL East standings and tied in the loss column with 24. The Orioles took three of four from the Yankees in Baltimore during their first meeting of the season from April 29-May 2.\n\nCole replaces right-hander Cody Poteet, who has pitched to a 2.14 ERA over four MLB starts this season. Poteet went to the 15-day injured list on Tuesday with a right triceps strain, though Cole was already set to slot into his spot in the rotation.\n\nDuring his recovery, Cole maintained a presence in the Yankees' clubhouse and embraced a mentor role with others on the staff.\n\n\"We need him back in the rotation, and it's good to have him here,\" Ausmus said of Cole. \"Although we're gonna miss his coaching abilities in the dugout one day a week.\"", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_sblendorio@nydailynews.com",

Yankees relief pitcher Victor Gonzales drilled Orioles shortstop Gunnar Henderson with a fastball in the seventh inning Wednesday night, which some thought may have been a retaliation for Baltimore hitting Aaron Judge and Gleyber Torres on Tuesday.\n\n\"No, not at all,\" Gonzalez said through an interpreter. \"You're trying to execute pitches when you're out there and competing. You're trying to execute an inside pitch there. Every time you're out there, you're trying to execute the best pitch you can. Like I said, it just slipped out there.\"\n\nGonzalez did admit, though, that the level of competition between the teams has been intense.\n\n\"You have two teams that are battling for the division,\" he continued. \"Everybody's competing at a high quality, and like I said, you want to execute and do the best you can to give your team the best shot possible.\"\n\nHenderson eventually scored on a fielding error after getting plunked, which ended up being the difference in the game. Baltimore took a 5-1 lead after his run, and it won 7-6 in 10 innings.\n\nThe Orioles broadcast notably took issue with the Yankees' pitching Wednesday night, saying \"shame on them\" after Henderson got plunked, via @FourSavages.\n\nWhile players will rarely admit it in interviews, pitchers at the MLB level know what they're doing. There's little doubt that New York adopted an \"eye for an eye\" mentality after Baltimore injured Judge Tuesday.\n\nWere the Yankees immature, or were they well within their right to hit back?\n\nIt's surprising how upset Baltimore's broadcasters were. Baseball teams have been petty about hit-by-pitches since the game was invented, and it won't stop anytime soon. Nobody is trying to kill each other, but once a team hits multiple batters in the same game, all bets are off.\n\nThat rule of thumb applies even more when the pitchers hit them at or above the hands. The closer the ball is to the face, the more sensitive the situation gets. Getting hit by major-league fastballs is painful, and it's okay to not always take the high road.\n\nAt the same time, New York should be careful. It could've won the game if it didn't intentionally put Henderson on base Wednesday night, and now its division lead over the Orioles is back to a slim one-and-a-half games. The Yankees would be smart to end the petty subplot here and focus on winning the rubber match on Thursday without any extracurricular activities.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joshua_valdez@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Joshua Valdez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_by_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hit by pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleyber_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gleyber Torres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Error (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Victor-Gonzalez-gets-real-about-plunking-Gunnar-Henderson.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659805", "eventUri": "eng-9659805", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Trevino entered Wednesday's game with the slowest arm out of 62 catchers in MLB. Last year, Trevino's average throw was 75 mph; this season, it's down to 71.6 mph. This week alone, the lack of arm strength has been a problem in two divisional games.\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles stole four bases in Wednesday's 7-6 win in 10 innings over the New York Yankees. This comes after Sunday's fiasco in Boston where the Red Sox set a franchise record with nine stolen bases against Trevino and the Yankees.\n\nIn Wednesday's game, Orioles outfielder Cedric Mullins stole third base in the 10th inning off Yankees closer Clay Holmes. Trevino launched the ball into left field, allowing Mullins to score, which turned out to be the deciding run in the game. Yankees manager Aaron Boone said Trevino didn't get a good transfer on the play. Trevino said he should not have thrown the ball at all.\n\nTrevino would not elaborate on why he thinks his arm speed has dropped by 3.4 mph since last season and simply answered \"no\" when asked if he was concerned by that fact. Boone also downplayed his catcher's arm being an issue.\n\n\"That throw where he doesn't have a good grip on it and still tries to force it anyways is going to register as bad miles per hour,\" Boone said. \"He's never been a miles-per-hour guy. It's on all of us to make sure we're controlling those things and making sure he's got to be really efficient and rely on exchange and getting the ball out and being accurate. We got to keep trying, as best as we can, to work on those things, work when we can on arm strength and keeping that as good as it can be. It's a group effort.\"\n\nBoone added that he thinks what has transpired on the basepaths lately hasn't changed opposing teams' plans for how they attack the Yankees. Mullins told reporters the Orioles weren't taking advantage of a perceived weakness behind the plate; stealing bases is just part of their team's identity.\n\nThe stolen-base issue that has crept up this week isn't solely on Trevino's arm. Pitchers are at fault, too. In Sunday's game, the Red Sox took advantage of Yankees starter Marcus Stroman being one of the easier pitchers to steal off of with his high leg kick to home plate and his lack of velocity. But controlling the running game has to improve. It's easily exploitable in October by teams that have speed.\n\n\"It's a team effort in that regard,\" said Gerrit Cole, who made his season debut Wednesday. \"It's about mixing up timings, strategic pickoffs -- obviously with that being limited, it's another element now. I guess awareness, too, of who's trying to steal when you can give up a bag or when you can focus more on the hitter and whatnot. It's something that opposing teams with speed are always challenging you on.\"\n\nNeither Trevino nor backup Austin Wells have good arms, but both rank inside the top five in framing. They're constantly stealing strikes for Yankees pitchers, which impacts the game more often than stolen base attempts. The organization as a whole has prioritized framing as the No. 1 skill for catchers. With the Yankees committing to Trevino and Wells, their lack of arm strength is just something that they'll have to live with for the time being. It's not the biggest problem facing the Yankees.\n\nThe Yankees bullpen for the last month has been one of the worst units in MLB.\n\nSince May 20, the Yankees' 4.81 ERA ranks 25th in the league. They're 21st in fWAR with 0.0; 22nd in FIP and K-BB%; and 28th in BB/9. Before May 20, the Yankees' 2.49 ERA was the best in baseball. Part of the problem has been Clay Holmes not being as crisp as he was to begin the season. In Holmes' first 20 innings of the season, he allowed zero runs. In his last 12 innings, Holmes has given up nine runs, including five in his last three outings.\n\n\"Definitely not where I want to be the last three outings,\" Holmes said. \"I think there's a little bit of a mixture there of not being able to put guys away when I need to on that swing and miss. I really haven't been beating myself. It's just a matter of putting guys away. Obviously, there's been some soft contact that's kind of led to some traffic. I have the pitches to do it. It's just a matter of making those pitches, reading swings and knowing what spots to go to with it. I know there's improvement there. I kind of know where I'm at. I know I'm better than what I've been in the last three outings.\"\n\nHolmes pitches to contact, and the risk of that is what happened Wednesday. Mullins hit a bloop single to center, allowing the Orioles' automatic runner on second to score. He was burned last month in a blown save against the Seattle Mariners where they registered weak contact but scored four runs against him.\n\nThe lack of strikeouts from the bullpen is an issue that needs solving. The Yankees came into Wednesday's game tied for 20th in bullpen strikeout percentage. No legitimate World Series contender ranks lower than the Yankees.\n\nThey'll need to solve this issue by the trade deadline. Scott Effross made his rehab assignment debut with Low-A Tampa on Wednesday and could help with the lack of swing-and-miss when he's back with the Yankees. JT Brubaker, acquired by the Pittsburgh Pirates earlier in the season, could also help, but he's being built up as a starter. Prospect Jack Neely, who was promoted to Triple A on Wednesday, had 52 strikeouts in 32 Double-A innings this season. It wouldn't be surprising to see him in the majors later in the season.\n\nBut, realistically, the Yankees should look externally for help to shore up the bullpen's lack of swing-and-miss. Several high-strikeout relievers could switch teams by the end of next month, such as Michael Kopech of the Chicago White Sox; Jake Diekman of the New York Mets; Lucas Erceg of the Oakland A's; Yimi Garc\u00eda of the Toronto Blue Jays; and Andrew Nardi and Tanner Scott of the Miami Marlins.\n\nPlugging this hole could be the difference between a short and long October.", "source": {"uri":

At the time, it didn't seem like it would matter much in the grand scheme of the things, but as it turns out, it would have a huge impact on the game's outcome.\n\n\"It's hard for us to know what's in Victor Gonzalez's mind,\" the broadcast booth said after seeing the pitch. \"So, we cannot sit here and say, with 100% certainty, that he hit Gunnar Henderson [on purpose], but here's what we can say. If the Yankees were thinking about doing something like this - down three in the seventh with the bases empty is the time they might do it.\n\n\"And if they did throw up and in intentionally to Gunnar Henderson, frankly, shame on them.\"\n\nHenderson trotted down to first base after that hit by pitch, then subsequently stole second. He was knocked in two batters later by Ryan Mountcastle to put the O's up 5-1.\n\nNew York's bats then came alive in the bottom half of the frame as they scored three runs to close the deficit to just one. They'd tack on the tying run in the bottom of the ninth before losing 7-6 in extra innings.\n\nThat Baltimore run proved important!\n\nHad Henderson not been plunked, and not gotten on base, that fifth run might never have crossed the plate. That would've allowed the Yankees to tie things up with that three-run seventh, before walking things off in the bottom of the ninth.\n\nOuch!\n\nNow, there's always the possibility that Henderson would've found his way to first base by way of a single or walk but simply hitting him made the job all the easier!\n\nTuesday night, both Aaron Judge and Gleyber Torres were hit by pitches in the hand, the first of which forced Judge to leave the game.\n\nThe slugger wasn't happy about being pitch, saying it was one of a number of \"up and in\" deliveries.\n\n\"I was definitely p -- ed, there were a couple of balls up and in... They like to throw in. That's part of it.\"\n\n-Aaron Judge on being hit by Baltimore pitching.\n\nHe wasn't the only one upset with the Orioles in that series opener. After seeing a second teammate plunked a few innings later, New York outfielder Alex Verdugo was seen threatening Baltimore players from the dugout.\n\nInterestingly enough, warnings were not handed out after Henderson was hit on Wednesday, despite what had transpired the night before. While he certainly had the right to be angry, the Orioles star kept his cool and walked down to first base without issue.\n\nHe'd make them pay on the scoreboard as opposed to with a reaction.

They also transferred Tyler Wells to the 60-day IL after his UCL surgery per Roch Kubatko of MASN.\n\nThis is an interesting decision.\n\nStowers has played well in his 17-game sample size, slashing .286/.278/.486 with a homer, four doubles and nine RBI across 45 at-bats.\n\nThis was easily the best he's looked during his time in the Majors after getting two previous opportunities and looking overwhelmed.\n\nMaton was acquired by Baltimore this offseason in a trade with the Detroit Tigers for cash considerations, and he's spent the entire year in the minors slashing .292/.390/.481 with their Triple-A affiliate.\n\nMaton gives the Orioles a bit more experience at the plate with his 180 career games and 438 at-bats. Plus, he has defensive versatility playing in both the outfield and infield.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriole_Park_at_Camden_Yards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oriole Park at Camden Yards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cy Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_Cole", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gerrit Cole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Maton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Maton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MASN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MASN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wells", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Wells"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2045,h_1150,x_0,y_102/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_orioles/01j0rr4jrbezx3k3a1fe.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659805", "eventUri": "eng-9659805", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

After all, if states intend, as they must, to comply with the Outer Space Treaty, they shouldn't be preparing to breach it.\n\nThe detonation of even a single nuclear weapon in space could destroy or permanently damage a significant proportion of satellites in orbit around Earth. The resultant radiation and debris would render many orbits unusable for a very long time. There would be highly disruptive and possibly life-threatening consequences for those essential applications, maps, weather, risk-monitoring, which would affect all states, not least developing nations.\n\nThe UK therefore voted in favour of this resolution.\n\nThere was nothing in this resolution that any law-abiding state committed to peace and the prevention of an arms race in outer space could reasonably object to.\n\nAnd yet Russia did.\n\nThis is not the first, but the second draft Council resolution on nuclear non-proliferation which Russia has vetoed in just one month.\n\nRussia vetoed the DPRK Panel of Experts' mandate - despite, or rather, because of the Panel's proven track record of exposing DPRK's dangerous nuclear and missile programmes, in violation of Security Council resolutions.\n\nRussia's actions cannot be interpreted any other way. They are seeking to undermine the global non-proliferation architecture, and this should be of grave concern to us all.\n\n/Public Release.

The draft resolution was introduced by United States and Japan, and co-sponsored by over 60 nations.\n\nAssembly Vice-President Ahmad Faisal Muhamad opened the debate by reading a message from Dennis Francis, President of the General Assembly.

A negative vote from any of these countries automatically causes a resolution or decision to fail.\n\nRussia: Serious legal doubts\n\nVasily Nebenzya, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Russia, explained why his delegation voted against the American draft resolution.\n\nHe stated that despite its \"beautiful sounding title\", the text failed to address its declared goal because that objective was already covered by existing international agreements and voiced concern the resolution could have had \"far-reaching consequences\" for disarmament processes.\n\n\"During the negotiations on this draft, we attempted in vain to get an answer from the authors on why they were trying to use the Security Council to reaffirm already existing international obligations in the area of outer space exploration,\" he said.\n\nHe referenced the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which unequivocally prohibits placing weapons of mass destruction in outer space and suggested that discussions on this topic should take place in specialized forums that include all General Assembly members.\n\nAmbassador Nebenzya criticized the draft for attempting to introduce new restrictions through the Security Council that were not previously established in any international instruments, including the 1967 Treaty, raising \"serious doubts from a legal point of view\" about these new restrictions.\n\n\"Imposing such obligations without preliminary, expert, legal and technical discussions is inadmissible,\" he emphasized.\n\nEU: Concern over hostile activities\n\nHedda Samson, Ambassador and Deputy Head of Delegation of the European Union (EU), responded to the Russian veto by emphasizing that it does not exempt Russia from its international legal obligations, including those outlined in the UN Charter, the 1967 Treaty, and international humanitarian law.\n\nShe emphasized the importance of enhancing space security, given that all nations increasingly depend on systems in orbit and beyond, for addressing climate change, disaster management, and sustainable development.\n\n\"Rising challenges and threats from outer space to our common security merit our full attention, including at the level of the Security Council,\" she added.\n\nIn closing, Ambassador Samson also voiced EU's concern over rising unfriendly and hostile activities in outer space.\n\n\"In this context, the European Union is actively engaged in promoting a safe, secure and sustainable space environment and the peaceful use of outer space on an equitable and mutually acceptable basis for all, for present and future generations,\" she said.\n\nJapan: Not an arena for a nuclear arms race\n\nKazuyuki Yamazaki, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Japan, urged delegates to consider the catastrophic consequences if a nuclear weapon were detonated in outer space, resulting in the destruction of satellites and critical space infrastructure with irreversible impacts on people's lives worldwide.\n\n\"The draft Security Council resolution on weapons of mass destruction in outer space, co-drafted by US and Japan, was intended to avoid such a nuclear catastrophe for humankind,\" he added.\n\nHe highlighted the broad support for the draft, with 13 votes in favour and 65 co-sponsors.\n\n\"Regrettably, one permanent member decided to silence the critical message we wanted to send to the present and future people of the world: outer space must remain a domain free of weapons of mass destruction,\" he lamented.\n\nHe said preventing nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in outer space \"must remain our priority\".\n\n\"Outer space must never be an arena for a nuclear arms race,\" he said.\n\nChina: Draft not comprehensive or balanced\n\nFU Cong, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of China, emphasized that outer space is the \"global commons and embodies the shared aspirations of all humanity\".\n\n\"The world today is not at peace.

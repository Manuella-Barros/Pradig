{"id": 223754716, "title": "Adam Armstrong breaks Leeds' hearts to fire Southampton to Premier League - 6 talking points", "text": "Southampton have sealed an instant return to the Premier League after beating Leeds United 1-0 in the Championship play-off final. The most lucrative match in world football, rumoured to be worth \u00a3180million no less, was contested at Wembley stadium between two of the three teams who were relegated from the top-flight last year. But it will be Southampton, not Leeds, who will rub shoulders with England's elite once more. After a tense start it was the Saints who drew first blood: top-scorer Adam Armstrong produced a picture perfect finish beyond Illan Meslier to silence the east side of Wembley. Leeds failed to respond to that hammer blow in the remainder of the first-half but rallied after the break. Crysencio Summerville led the charge and had two shots blocked in quick succession as Daniel Farke's men went in search of an equaliser. Ultimately Leeds came up short, though, and were forced to watch from the Wembley turf as Southampton celebrated promotion. Here are Mirror Football's talking points... Saints' main man delivers...again Cometh the hour, cometh the man. Southampton's main man, no less. With 23 goals to his name in all competitions prior to Sunday's seismic showdown at Wembley, Armstrong has, both figuratively and literally, led from the front for Russell Martin's side this season - so it was fitting that he plundered the goal which propelled the Saints back into the Premier League. Armstrong has proven too hot to handle for Championship defences this year but, like Southampton, he has a point to prove in the Premier League. The 27-year-old managed just four league goals during his two years in the top-flight with the Saints but has been a player reborn under Martin in the Championship. Saints' main man signed off the 2023/24 campaign by notching his 24th goal of the season, rather poetically, in the 24th minute. And he'll fancy his chances of doing himself justice in the Premier League next year. The Leeds curse continues It doesn't make defeat any easier, but Leeds are no stranger to the bitter sting of play-off heartbreak. Prior to Sunday, their play-off resume made grim reading: five campaigns, five defeats. From Jack Marriott to Jimmy Abdou, they've been there, done it and got the t-shirt. And unfortunately for Leeds fans, that rotten 100 per cent record was still in tact at the final whistle after they failed to breach a resolute Southampton backline. Only the three other teams in the top four managed more than the 81 goals Leeds notched during the regulation season but they never really troubled Alex McCarthy after Armstrong's tremendous opener. Leeds have been looked a cut above at times this season and were well worth their place in this promotion shoot-out - but they failed to fire on the biggest stage. Martin outfoxes Farke Russell Martin knows all about Daniel Farke's record in the Championship - he played under the German at Norwich City. But while Farke has two Premier League promotions to his name, Martin had none as a manager prior to Sunday's showdown under the arch. Favouring a possession-based game, Martin found a different way to win as Southampton actually gave up the majority of the ball to Leeds, who shaded enjoyed 57.5 per cent possession. Not everyone was convinced when Martin landed the Southampton job in the summer given modest league finishes with MK Dons and Swansea, but in winning promotion he has silenced some of those critics. Martin admitted himself in the build-up to the play-off final that he would be deemed \"a huge failure\" if he didn't get the job done at Wembley. Instead, he was left toasting promotion. Smallbone stars on the big stage After growing up in Basingstoke, homegrown midfielder Will Smallbone could only watch from afar as his beloved Southampton were relegated last year. Smallbone was on loan in the Championship with Stoke while his hometown club struggled in the top-flight, but he's played an influential role on the south coast this term. It turns out the Irish midfielder saved his best performance for last; he covered every blade of grass on the daunting Wembley pitch thrice times over and teed up Armstrong for the all-important winning goal. After being consigned to a watching brief last year, Smallbone had a starring role in Southampton's redemption story - and nobody in red and white will have savoured the moment more than him. Bad news for Leeds - and the Championship Given both Leeds and Southampton both headed into Sunday's match with star-studded squads, whoever ended up losing was always likely to be left vulnerable ahead of the summer transfer window. And it's now Leeds who face a fight to hang onto some of their biggest and brightest stars before the Championship kicks off again in August. The likes of Crycensio Summerville, Georginio Rutter, Wilfried Gnonto and Archie Gray have already been linked with transfers and could be lured away if top-flight interest materialises. But on the flip-side, few in the Championship will fancy taking on Leeds next year if they can retain the nucleus of their squad - and even fewer would bet against them being in the promotion mix again. Bridging the gap The gap between the Premier League and the Championship feels more like a chasm these days. It's no coincidence that the three promoted teams from last year all succumbed to the drop while two of the three who were relegated from the Premier League last year have booked an instant return. Ipswich Town are the anomaly in this scenario and they, Leicester, Southampton and Leeds have been significantly better than the rest of the teams in the second-tier. But three of those four were effectively chewed up and spat out by the Premier League. Southampton, like the other two promoted sides, will be able to invest heavily should they wish after leaving Wembley with the coveted nine-figure bounty. But as last year's promoted teams can attest, reaching the Premier League and staying there are two very different things. And it's getting harder and harder to achieve them both.

Hockey India's appeal against this decision was turned down on Monday, making Rohidas ineligible for the crucial semifinal match. India has already had some experience playing without Rohidas, as they managed three quarters without him against Great Britain but his absence might prove crucial.\n\nIndia Pumped Up\n\nIndia's defense, which struggled earlier in the pool matches, has improved significantly, passing the Great Britain test with flying colors. They will be keen to maintain this resilience and composure against Germany, who have scored the most goals and won five out of six matches so far.\n\nIndia defeated Germany in the bronze medal match at the Tokyo Olympics, and while they had a win and a loss against Germany during the FIH Pro League in June, those matches were part of the buildup phase when teams were experimenting. The intensity of the Olympic semifinals is expected to be much higher.\n\nManpreet performed well as Rohidas' substitute in defense and is likely to take on that role again. However, India will need to manage with one fewer player on the bench, which might affect their rolling substitutions.\n\nThe team will focus on maintaining their coordination and safeguarding their goal against a German team that has scored 14 field goals. India, in contrast, has netted eight of its 11 goals from penalty corners or strokes, making drag-flicker Harmanpreet a key player in Rohidas' absence. Rohidas also plays a crucial role as a penalty corner specialist and blocker.\n\nGermany, benefiting from prolific scorers like Christopher Ruhr and Justus Weigand, will aim to continue their strong performance and put India under pressure following their quarterfinal victory over Argentina.\n\nWhen and Where\n\nThe India Vs Germany men's hockey semifinal at Paris Olympics 2024 will be played on Tuesday, Aug 6 at Yves-du-Manoir Stadium.\n\nThe India Vs Germany men's hockey semifinal at Paris Olympics 2024 begins at 7 pm (local time), 1pm ET, 6:30pm BST and 10:30pm IST.\n\nHow to Watch/ Livestream\n\nUnited States: The India Vs Germany men's hockey semifinal at Paris Olympics 2024 will be broadcast on Peacock, NBC Sports, Universo while live streaming will be available on Fubo.\n\nUnited Kingdom: The India Vs Germany men's hockey semifinal at Paris Olympics 2024 will be broadcast on Discovery+, EuroSport Player UK.

However, Germany's solid defence blocked India captain and drag-flicker Harmanpreet Singh's shots. India maintained pressure deep inside Germany's circle, with Vice Captain Hardik Singh showcasing his exceptional dribbling skills.\n\nIndia's relentless attacking approach earned them a series of penalty corners, with Harmanpreet Singh converting the fourth one in the 7th minute to give India a well-deserved lead. This goal marked his eighth in the tournament. Meanwhile, Germany switched to a possession-based game to relieve the pressure, but they couldn't mount any significant threats, ending the first quarter with India leading 1-0.\n\nAlso Read | Real Madrid vs Chelsea, Club Friendly 2024 Live Streaming Online in India: How To Watch Pre-Season Football Match Live Telecast on TV & Football Score Updates in IST?.\n\nGermany began the second quarter strongly, matching India in the early exchanges. Within the first three minutes, they earned a penalty corner, which Gonzalo Peillat converted in the 18th minute to level the score.\n\nDespite this, India continued to apply relentless pressure. In the 20th minute, Abhishek had a powerful shot on goal from inside the D, but Germany's defender Mathias Mueller deflected it wide. A few minutes later, Lalit Kumar Upadhyay had a chance to score, but his shot went over the goalpost.\n\nGermany then won a penalty corner against the run of play, and Peillat's shot struck Jarmanpreet Singh's foot, resulting in a penalty stroke. Christopher Ruehr quickly converted the stroke in the 27th minute, flicking it to the right of India's goalkeeper PR Sreejesh. At halftime, the score was 2-1 in favour of Germany.\n\nDetermined to bounce back, India started the third quarter aggressively, winning consecutive penalty corners. However, Harmanpreet Singh's shot was saved by Jean-Paul Danneberg. Undeterred, India continued to press for an equalizer, which they found in the 36th minute when a penalty corner flick by Harmanpreet was deflected in by Sukhjeet Singh.\n\nWith the score tied, both teams intensified their attacks, frequently testing each other's defences. Despite the increased efforts, neither team could break the deadlock, and the third quarter ended with the score level at 2-2.\n\nThe fourth quarter began with Germany making swift passes and penetrating India's defence to win a penalty corner, but Sanjay made a stunning goal-line save to prevent Germany from taking the lead. However, Germany continued their relentless attacks and finally broke through in the 54th minute when Marco Miltkau scored after receiving an assist from Teo Hinrichs on the left flank. This goal eventually proved decisive, as Germany won the match 3-2 to make it to the Final.\n\nIn the bronze medal match, India will lock horns against Spain on Thursday.

Germany took a 2-1 lead over India at the break in the mega semi-final at the Paris 2024 Olympics. India completely dominated the first quarter with a goal from Harmanpreet Singh but Germany came back in style in the second quarter and scored a couple of times to take the lead in the game.\n\nHarmanpreet Singh and co. have played incredible hockey in the current campaign, beating the likes of Australia and Great Britain en route to the semi-finals. India have a rich history at the Olympics, but they have not won a gold medal in over 40 years. India won the last of their eight Olympic gold medals in the 1980 Games in Moscow, but they have a chance to end their drought in Paris and given their form, the chances of that happening are high.\n\nIndia and Germany also share a lot of history in sports. Germany is a familiar opponent for India in high-stakes tournaments, the most famous of which is the bronze medal match in Tokyo, where India secured a thrilling 5-4 victory, thanks to a stunning last-second save by PR Sreejesh.\n\nThe Germans defeated Argentina 3-2 in the quarter-finals to set up the semi-final with India, who put up a spirited performance against Great Britain in their last match. Down a man, India fought hard for over 40 minutes and took the match to the penalty shootout with the score at 1-1. PR Sreejesh made some great saves in the penalty shootout, which saw India beat Great Britain 4-2 in the shootout.\n\nSreejesh, playing his last international tournament, was a strong scorer for India, saving numerous goals in the last two quarters to deny Britain several chances to take the lead.\n\nSreejesh made 10 spectacular saves from field shots. As if that wasn't enough, he saved 10 penalty corners.\n\n\"When I stepped onto the field today (Sunday), there were two options for me. This could be my last match or I get a chance to play two more matches and I think, yes, I have two more matches now,\" Sreejesh said later.\n\nHowever, it will not be easy for India to replace Amit Rohidas in the defensive line as he was shown a red card against Great Britain.

Not only did they overcome the mighty Australians in the group stage, they took down Great Britain in the quarterfinals after being reduced to a 10-man side. On Tuesday, India did take the early lead against Germany in the Paris Olympics semifinal, before the Germans regrouped themselves to take the lead twice in the match. India eventually set themselves up for a dramatic final second equaliser, but fell agonisingly short of making the final for the first time in 44 years as they went down 2-3 in the match.\n\nThe Harmanpreet Singh-led India went all guns blazing in the opening quarter as they pressed the German defence hard and, in the process, scored the first goal of the match through the skipper himself. But the three-time Olympic champions, known for their steely resolve, roared back strongly in the second quarter. Gonzalo Peillat pulled off the equaliser from a penalty corner, before Christopher Ruhr helped them take the lead lead through a penalty stroke conversion. Six minutes into the second half, India levelled the score after Sukhjeet Singh nicely deflected in a variation from Harmanpreet's flick.\n\nThe Germans attacked with intensity in the fourth and final quarter, and with just six minutes from the final hooter, they scored the winner when Marco Miltkau deflected in a cross to shatter Indian hearts. India eventually set themselves up for one final chance when Harmanpreet picked out an unmarked Shamsher, but the short was sent wide of the mark by just millimeters.\n\nThe Indians had their chances in the match. They earned as many as 11 penalty corners but converted just one. Germany, on the other hand, secured only four penalty corners and converted two of them.\n\nFollowing the loss, coach Craig Fulton was left distraught at the missed opportunity from Shamsher, while the players were left crestfallen with captain Harmanpreet and the veteran Sreejesh fighting back tears.\n\nIt was a great opportunity for India to enter the final Olympics for the first time since the 1980 Games, but Germany dashed their hopes. India will now take on Spain in the bronze medal match, while Germany will face Netherlands in the final.\n\n\"This is extremely disappointing as we came here to win a gold medal. But, having said that, it's better to go home with bronze than nothing,\" Harmanpreet told Jio Cinema after the match. \"When you lose in the semifinal game, it's not that easy to take as reaching the final is a dream of any athlete,\" the captain added.\n\nThe captain and Sreejesh, however, agreed that the side did commit a few mistakes that cost them in the semifinal match.\n\n\"We made a few errors in defence and we missed a few chances,\" Harmanpreet, who put India ahead with his seventh minute strike, said.\n\nSreejesh added, \"We can't commit such silly mistakes during the match.

However, Germany's solid defence blocked India captain and drag-flicker Harmanpreet Singh's shots. India maintained pressure deep inside Germany's circle, with Vice Captain Hardik Singh showcasing his exceptional dribbling skills.\n\nIndia's relentless attacking approach earned them a series of penalty corners, with Harmanpreet Singh converting the fourth one in the 7th minute to give India a well-deserved lead. This goal marked his eighth in the tournament. Meanwhile, Germany switched to a possession-based game to relieve the pressure, but they couldn't mount any significant threats, ending the first quarter with India leading 1-0.\n\nGermany began the second quarter strongly, matching India in the early exchanges. Within the first three minutes, they earned a penalty corner, which Gonzalo Peillat converted in the 18th minute to level the score.\n\nDespite this, India continued to apply relentless pressure. In the 20th minute, Abhishek had a powerful shot on goal from inside the D, but Germany's defender Mathias Mueller deflected it wide. A few minutes later, Lalit Kumar Upadhyay had a chance to score, but his shot went over the goalpost.\n\nGermany then won a penalty corner against the run of play, and Peillat's shot struck Jarmanpreet Singh's foot, resulting in a penalty stroke. Christopher Ruehr quickly converted the stroke in the 27th minute, flicking it to the right of India's goalkeeper PR Sreejesh. At halftime, the score was 2-1 in favour of Germany.\n\nDetermined to bounce back, India started the third quarter aggressively, winning consecutive penalty corners. However, Harmanpreet Singh's shot was saved by Jean-Paul Danneberg. Undeterred, India continued to press for an equalizer, which they found in the 36th minute when a penalty corner flick by Harmanpreet was deflected in by Sukhjeet Singh.\n\nWith the score tied, both teams intensified their attacks, frequently testing each other's defences. Despite the increased efforts, neither team could break the deadlock, and the third quarter ended with the score level at 2-2.\n\nThe fourth quarter began with Germany making swift passes and penetrating India's defence to win a penalty corner, but Sanjay made a stunning goal-line save to prevent Germany from taking the lead. However, Germany continued their relentless attacks and finally broke through in the 54th minute when Marco Miltkau scored after receiving an assist from Teo Hinrichs on the left flank. This goal eventually proved decisive, as Germany won the match 3-2 to make it to the Final.\n\nIn the bronze medal match, India will lock horns against Spain on Thursday.

pressure.\n\nHarmanpreet (7th) and Sukhjeet (36th) scored for India while Gonzalo Peillat (18th) Christopher Ruehr (27th) and Marco Mitcau (54th) found the net for the winners.\n\nHardik entered the circle from the left and in no time created a penalty corner by landing a ball on the foot of a German defender but Jean-Paul Dannesburg blocked Harmanpreet's attempt.\n\nHowever, Hardik collected the rebound ball to earn one more chance but German custodian Jean-Paul Dennerberg again made a save.\n\nA Harmanpreet long hit touched the foot of a German defender, resulting in another penalty corner for India but it also went in vain.\n\nIndia continued to attack, getting three more chances and finally got on board on the sixth.\n\nHarmanpreet fired his shot that deflected off Martin Zwicker and ballooned into the goal post.\n\nJarmanpreet Singh then raised his stick in the air to stop a scoop from a German player, which was resulted in a penalty corner for dangerous play in the second quarter.\n\nAnd Germany were quick to neutralise the lead through Peillat's precision strike from a penalty corner.\n\nSoon after receiving a pass, Sumit made a terrific run from the left but was blocked by two German defenders.\n\nLalit Upadhyay also had a chance to double India's lead after receiving a ball from Abhishek, but he hit over the bar.\n\nIndia continued to attack as Mandeep Singh flew with the ball from the centre of the pitch, and passed it to Gurjant Singh inside the striking circle but he lost possession of the ball.\n\nThe Germans did not miss their chances when they got a penalty corner, which was converted into a penalty stroke as the goal-bound ball touched Jarmanpreet's foot.\n\nAnd Ruehr made no mistake in getting past Sreejesh's defence, firing one on his right side.\n\nIndia got a chance to level the score but fluffed two more penalty corners.\n\nHarmanpreet's shot was blocked by Dannerberg with his left hand and Hardik hit the rebound wide.\n\nA 10th penalty corner came India's way but it went abegging.\n\nThe score-levelling goal finally came from the stick of Sukhjeet, who deflected the dragflick of Harmanpreet from the team's 11th penalty corner.\n\nGermany got their chance to move ahead with their third penalty corner early into the fourth quarter when Harmanpreet obstructed a rival player.\n\nBut Sreejesh saved the chance, the rebound ball was again fired towards the Indian post but Ruehr's shot from the left was saved by Sanjay.\n\nThe Germans did not have to wait for their next chance but India's stout defence averted the danger.\n\nSreejesh's defence was, though, breached when Miltkau deflected a pass from Peillat from the right.\n\nIndia made several attempts to get the equaliser and even took Sreejesh off the field to inject one more player but it was not meant to be.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He also hoped that the players would come back after conceding a defeat in the semis.\n\n\"I wouldn't say it was a close match because we got a lot of chances to score a goal...It is due to our own mistake that we could not reach the finals. It is our bad luck...I have faith that the players will make a comeback after this match...,\" Dilip said.\n\nThe Indian team was quick off the blocks with their relentless attacking approach which earned them a series of penalty corners.\n\nHarmanpreet Singh converted the fourth one in the 7th minute to give India a well-deserved lead. This goal marked his eighth in the tournament.\n\nGermany began the second quarter strongly, matching India in the early exchanges. Within the first three minutes, they earned a penalty corner, which Gonzalo Peillat converted in the 18th minute to level the score.\n\nGermany eventually led but India equalised, keeping the fans on the edge of their seats. With the score tied, both teams intensified their attacks, frequently testing each other's defences. Despite the increased efforts, neither team could break the deadlock, and the third quarter ended with the score level at 2-2.\n\nThe fourth quarter began with Germany making swift passes and penetrating India's defence to win a penalty corner, but Sanjay made a stunning goal-line save to prevent Germany from taking the lead.\n\nHowever, Germany continued their relentless attacks and finally broke through in the 54th minute when Marco Miltkau scored after receiving an assist from Teo Hinrichs on the left flank. This goal eventually proved decisive, as Germany won the match 3-2 to make it to the final.

AP\n\nThe Harmanpreet Singh-led India men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hockey team suffered a heart-breaking defeat to Germany in the semi-finals of the 2024 Paris Olympics on Tuesday. Germany defeated India 3-2 in the second semi-final to set up a title clash against Netherlands, whereas India will now face Spain in the bronze medal match on Thursday.\n\nIndia had taken an early 1-0 lead on the back of a Harmanpreet Singh goal in the first quarter, but in the second quarter, India found themselves on the back foot after Germany responded via goal from Gonzalo Peillat in the 18th minute. Germany scored yet another goal in the 27th minute on the back of Christopher Ruhr, but their lead did not last long.\n\nIn the 36th minute, India won a penalty corner and as usual Harmanpreet was on the drag flick. Sukhjeet got a deflection off Harmanpreet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drag flick to slot the ball past German goalkeeper Jean-Paul Daneberg.\n\nGermany, however, were more aggressive as the game progressed and tested India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defensive skills as much.

In Tokyo, the Manpreet Singh-led team had ended India's 41-year-old wait for an Olympic medal in hockey by winning bronze with a 5-4 victory against Germany. Three years later, the same opposition inflicted a painful defeat against Harmanpreet Singh's Indian men's hockey team to book a spot in the final against the Netherlands and extend India's long wait for hockey gold at the Games for another four years at least. The last time India advanced to the final was in 1980. That, incidentally, was India's last hockey goal medal (8th) at the Olympics.\n\nThe Germany vs Netherlands final will take place on August 8 (Thursday). India, on the other hand, will go into the bronze medal match against Spain on the same day.\n\nIndia started the match perfectly, applying immense pressure on the German defence. The result showed in India earning their first penalty corner as early as the second minute of the match. But captain Harmanpreet Singh's below-par conversation rate became a cause of concern for India as it took them seven attempts (four of them from rebound) to finally convert a penalty corner into a goal to draw first blood. Credit must also be given to the German defence, who applied double-rusher tactics to narrow Harmanpreet's drag flick angle.\n\nIndia dominated the first quarter in every department. The Germans hardly penetrated the circle, but things changed drastically after the first 15 minutes. Germany came roaring back in the second quarter. They got a penalty corner in the third minute, and Gonazo Peillat, the former Argentine Olympian, scored the equalizer from the rebound.\n\nIndia had the chance to take the lead back from a counter-attack, but Abhishek's shot went wide. The easiest chance, however, was squandered by the experienced Lalit Upadhyay in the 23rd minute. He had a clear shot at goal, but his poor first touch allowed the ball to bounce a bit more than expected, which carried his stroke way above the goalpost.\n\nIndia paid the price for wasting chances as Germany applied pressure to earn their third penalty corner of the match. The absence of star defender Amit Rohidas, who is also the Indian side's first rusher, was felt dearly as Peillat once again had a free flick at the goal, evading the Indian defenders. The ball was destined for the goal, but it hit Jarmanpreet Singh's foot, resulting in Germany getting a penalty stroke. Christopher Ruehr made no mistake to put Germany in the lead at halftime.\n\nIndia's attacking instincts were once again in full show after the break.

India's brilliant run at the Paris Games suffered a big stomp after their 44-year-old long hunt for an Olympics gold was left spoilt by a late goal from Germany's Marco Miltkau on Tuesday.\n\nWith PR Sreejesh playing his last tournament for India, all eyes of the Indian fans were hoping for their side to clinch their spot in the final. Specifically, after beating the likes of New Zealand and even their long-rivals Australia for the maiden time, fans and former players alike were hoping for the Indian team to turn their Tokyo Olympics bronze medal into Gold in Paris. However, some costly defensive errors and a clinical lack of finishing snatched away those dreams.\n\nParis Olympics 2024: India Schedule | Full Coverage | Medal Tally\n\nSpeaking to JioCinema, PR Sreejesh reflected upon the heavy nature of losing a semi-final, but how it is important for his side to move on from the loss and focus on winning the bronze medal for their country.\n\n\"See when you lose in a semi-final game, it's not that easy, because once you are in the finals, you are fighting for the gold, and that's a dream of any athlete. That's what we were here for. The last three years, every day, when we were on the field, we worked really hard to change the colour of that medal which we got last time. We just missed that opportunity. So it's heartbreaking because those days were very hard. It was not easy. But see, now it's done. We got the opportunity. We missed it. Now it's the time to get something,\" Sreejesh said.\n\nWhile handling the emotions of missing out on a chance to fight for gold in his final international tournament, PR Sreejesh also explained how his team's priority lies first than his own individual mark.\n\n\"See, rather than my situation, the team's situation is more important. I think that rather than working ourselves up too much about today. The emotions which we are going through today, we need to just forget about that and move on, bounce back, prepare for the next one and do well in the other match,\" Sreejesh added.\n\nIndia skipper Harmanpreet Singh found it difficult to process the weight after the loss. However, Harmanpreet did not fail to acknowledge the importance of returning to India with atleast a medal.\n\n\"It's unbelievable. It's a very hard moment. Last time we were here, and we went home with the bronze medal. We did all that we could but maybe it just wasn't our day. But now we need to focus so that we don't go home empty-handed,\" Harmanpreet told JioCinema.\n\nDespite India taking the early lead, Germany pounced on every defensive error made by the harmanpreet-led side and completed an ecstatic turnaround. Harmanpreet gave India an early lead in the first quarter, only for Gonzalo Peillat to equalise for Germany in the second.\n\nA clumsy body block by Jermanpreet Singh during a Germany penalty-corner, resulted in Christopher Ruehr giving his side a lead from a penalty stroke. India did draw level with Sukhjeet Singh flicking a Harmanpreet penalty-corner into the German goal, only for Miltkau to restore the lead in the dying minutes of the game.

India's hunt for their first gold medal in 44 years came to a heartbreaking end as Shamsher Singh shot over the crossbar with what was the last hit of the day, missing the equaliser by inches. India were hoping to reach the final for the first time since the 1980 Games in Moscow.Tokyo Olympic Games bronze medallists are out of contention for the top two spots but have the chance to redeem themselves in the bronze medal match against Spain on Thursday. The country is the leading medallist in hockey at the Olympics and has the chance to win its 14th medal at the Games (eight golds, one silver, three bronze). India will be hoping to win back-to-back medals in the Olympics after the 1972 edition in Munich.\n\nIndia once again relied on their prolific skipper Harmanpreet Singh for the goals as the 28-year-old opened the scoring through yet another penalty corner in the seventh minute.\n\nIndia's decision to go on the defensive once they got the lead worked in favour of the Germans as they unleashed a flurry of attacks in response. The response was swift and immediate as they levelled the game through defender Gonzalo Peillat's penalty corner in the 13th minute.\n\nAs the game neared half-time, a German attempt from a penalty corner hit defender Jarmanpreet Singh's leg which resulted in a penalty stroke for the World Champions. Christopher Ruehr to take a 2-1 lead into half-time. India kept their nerves going into the all-important second half and kept knocking at the German defence. A penalty corner in the 37th minute saw Harmanpreet Singh strike it hard and low, Sukhjeet Singh followed the ball and got to the end of it to deflect it into the goals and level the score for the side.\n\nGermany earned a penalty corner in the 46th minute which was saved by Sreejesh, however, the ball fell to the Germans who had a clear sight of an empty goal. But an amazing goal-line save by substitute Sanjay kept the game on level terms.\n\nGermany's repeated attempts at goal finally saw them breach the Indian defence in the 54th minute as Marco Miltkau scored the first field goal of the night.\n\nWhen all hope seemed lost, a last-ditch attempt by India saw the ball fall to substitute Shamsher Singh who had a clear shot at goal with only the goalkeeper to beat. But his attempt sailed over the goalpost ahead of the final whistle.\n\nIndia have lost their second successive semifinal at the Olympic Games having lost 2-5 to eventual champions Belgium at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. They had then gone on to beat Germany 5-4 in the bronze medal match to end a four-decade-long drought.\n\nThe players will hope that history repeats itself in Paris and they bag another bronze medal.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_corner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Penalty corner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamsher_Singh_(field_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shamsher Singh (field hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_men's_national_field_hockey_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India men's national field hockey team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmanpreet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harmanpreet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_turf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial turf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarmanpreet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jarmanpreet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzalo_Peillat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gonzalo Peillat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shootout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shootout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-time", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Half-time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Miltkau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marco Miltkau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://weeklyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Untitled-design-2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795381", "eventUri": "eng-9795381", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 12}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

They had earlier beaten the mighty Australians and then overcame Great Britain in the quarterfinal with 10 men. Yet, the semifinal against Germany, the world champions, needed something more.\n\nINDIA'S OLYMPIC MEDAL TALLY | INDIA AT PARIS OLYMPICS | LATEST OLYMPIC NEWS | KEY DATES AT PARIS 2024\n\nHarmanpreet Singh's team kept pushing, created chances, scored goals, conceded, and defended valiantly. In the end, even the best against the best proved insufficient. The Germans had a little more quality in the ranks and eventually won the match 3-2. Once again for India, it's the fight for the bronze, this time against Spain on August 8.\n\nGermany, like any world champion hockey team, started strongly. India knew that if they allowed the Germans to dictate the terms right from the first quarter, it would become a long, frustrating evening. Craig Fulton's men deserve credit for stopping their opponents from following their plan. This time, it was India who started well.\n\nIn the second minute itself, Hardik Singh entered the circle from the left and won a penalty corner. It didn't result in a goal, but it was a statement.\n\nThe goal came in the seventh minute, captain Harmanpreet, maintained his scoring touch and converted a penalty corner, via a deflection. It was a deserving lead. But this is Germany, the best team at this Olympics, with more than a few game-changers in their team. Gonzalo Peillat, already a gold medal winner with Argentina, equalised in the second quarter with a powerful dragflick.\n\nJust before the half-time break, Christopher Ruhr gave his team the lead via a penalty stroke. It seemed the ball hit Jarmanpreet Singh on the foot while on target, although the replays showed it was not going in for certain. Six minutes after the break, India were back on level terms after Sukhjeet Singh deflected in a dragflick from Harmanpreet. A well-worked penalty corner variation to beat the German rushers and the keeper. It was 2-2 going into the final quarter. Both teams deserved their goals and not much to separate the two.\n\nIt was in the final quarter though, when the Germans raised their level and pushed a little bit more than their opponents. India were on the back foot but did not make big errors. The ever-reliable PR Sreejesh pulled off a couple of saves while Sanjay prevented a certain goal with an on-the-line block.\n\nSix minutes before full-time, Peillat found the space on the left, passed it to the centre and Marco Miltkau came up with a perfect deflection to make it 3-2. The relentless pressure and the quality on the ball paid off.\n\nEven then, a one-goal deficit with over five minutes to go was not an uphill task. India removed Sreejesh in search of the equaliser but the Germans frustrated them by not allowing them to take control. The same Germans won the World Cup not so long ago and the experience of playing big matches showed.\n\nThe golden chance for India came in the dying seconds of the match. Harmanpreet's aerial ball found Shamsher Singh in the D. All he had to do was find the target without the defenders in front of him. The take was perfect but the finish flew over goalkeeper Jean-Paul Dannerberg. The Germans celebrated the miss as the hooter went off. The world champions will now fight for the Olympic gold against the Netherlands.\n\nA tough loss for India but there's also a chance to win the bronze. Spain had beaten the Germans and later the Olympic champions Belgium to reach the semifinals. At this level, no opponent is easy to play against, but India's performances have only been improving after each match.\n\nThey still have players who are in form and almost made it to the final. They have a legendary goalkeeper who will be playing his last international match. There's no reason why they cannot end the campaign with a medal.", "source": {"uri": "espn.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anish_anand@espn.in", "name": "Anish Anand", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmanpreet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harmanpreet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_corner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Penalty corner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_men's_national_field_hockey_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India men's national field hockey team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarmanpreet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jarmanpreet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzalo_Peillat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gonzalo Peillat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shootout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shootout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Fulton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Craig Fulton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamsher_Singh_(field_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shamsher Singh (field hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men's_FIH_Hockey_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Men's FIH Hockey World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Miltkau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marco Miltkau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Field_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Field Hockey", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0806%2Fr1369536_1023x682_3%2D2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795381", "eventUri": "eng-9795381", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 722, "textEnd": 730}], "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

They started on absolute fire in the first quarter, led by the irrepressible Hardik Singh, who had a fine game in midfield.\n\nThe goal that India deserved came in the 7th minute, as Harmanpreet Singh's dragflick took a deflection and looped over German goalkeeper Jean-Paul Danneberg.

And then he struck another fierce dragflick at Jarmanpreet Singh's foot on the line for a penalty stroke, which Christopher Ruhr converted comfortably.\n\nHowever, losing the lead late in the first half despite a performance that didn't warrant trailing didn't make India lose their bearings. They stuck to their attacking game plan, with Hardik, Abhishek and Sukhjeet prominently featuring. The equaliser came when Abhishek won a penalty corner, which Harmanpreet rolled into Sukhjeet's path for him to deflect over Danneberg.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, though, Germany upped the ante and the pressure on the Indian defence was beginning to tell, as they started making a few mistakes at the back. Eventually, they left Miltkau unmarked right in front of goal, Peillat found him with a peach of a pass, and India's dream of gold was ended.\n\nThe performance should give them hope and confidence as they move into that last match in the Olympics to bring home another medal for India.", "source": {"uri": "espn.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aaditya_narayan@espn.in", "name": "Aaditya Narayan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_corner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Penalty corner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Miltkau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marco Miltkau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmanpreet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harmanpreet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzalo_Peillat", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gonzalo Peillat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shootout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shootout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_at_the_2014_Commonwealth_Games_\u2013_Men's_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hockey at the 2014 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalit_Upadhyay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lalit Upadhyay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarmanpreet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarmanpreet Singh"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Militaria", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Militaria", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0806%2Fr1369493_1024x576_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795381", "eventUri": "eng-9795381", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

AP\n\nIndian hockey revived memories of their gallant stick-work on the Olympic platform, but also betrayed the shortcomings that had caused their slump when they faltered in advancing to the final of the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nDishing out a gallant display against reigning world champions Germany, misfiring India faltered to a 2-3 loss in the semi-finals, and would now need to work hard to retain the bronze medal they had clinched in Tokyo.\n\nIndia were prodigious, even when one short on the bench; they tested the resolve of the fancied World champions; caused them trouble galore; muffed several scoring opportunities; yet in the end were left to rue their lapses. This is the repeat of an old story \u00e2\u20ac\" which Tuesday denied them a stirring victory in the Olympic semi-finals against Germany.\n\nAlso read | Netizens disappointed after India lose to Germany in hockey semi-finals\n\nThis isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a strange new twist to the tale. This is an exact repetition of what India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s teams have gone out and done earlier, time and again. That India could match Germany until six minutes from the close was credible. That India took the initial lead and then rallied to equalise for 2-2 was also credit-worthy.\n\nBut what hurt India was the misfiring strikers who failed to fire on target and the inability to make full use of the penalty corners earned by them.\n\nAt the Tokyo Olympics, India had defeated Germany to clinch the bronze medal, earning them a place on the medal podium after a gap of 41 years. On Tuesday, a slightly improved marksmanship would have put India in the final \u00e2\u20ac\" and truly marked the return of the prodigals.\n\nGermany are not a team that concedes too many scoring opportunities to their rivals. Their defence is famed the world over. Once Germany take the lead, they grind you into the turf and yet deny even a shot at the goal. The packed Germany defence has for decades frustrated the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best teams \u00e2\u20ac\" and often it was Germany who carried the day.\n\nWhat may occasionally unnerve Germany is when they are trailing, and the gaps their leave in their defence when going all out in the search of goals.\n\nAgainst Germany, one has to play like a miser, but the Indian strikers played like millionaires \u00e2\u20ac\" wasting chances galore. In the second quarter, Abhishek and Lalit Upadhyay went for rushed attempts that sprayed the ball wide in wasting chances that could have given India a sound lead \u00e2\u20ac\" after captain Harmanpreet Singh had converted a penalty corner to open the scoring in the seventh minute.\n\nAnother of Harmanpreet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shots was deflected into the net for India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second goal, but India had to pay a heavy price for wasting nine other penalty corners \u00e2\u20ac\" and that too against a top side like Germany.\n\nCompare it with the clinical show of Germany, who initially were bent on keeping Indian shots out of their goal. When they moved up, they made their few chances count. From four German penalty corners came two goals, one via a penalty stroke.\n\nThe German coach also used his Argentina import Gonzalo Peillat as the trump card \u00e2\u20ac\" reviving memories of the World Cup final last year, when he had dashed the hopes of Belgium in the final.\n\nMigrating to Germany after winning the 2016 Olympic gold medal for Argentina, Peillat played a crucial role in his new team winning the World Cup in Bhubaneshwar. Now, he has engineered Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entry into the Olympic final. Piellat not only converted the first penalty corner and earned a penalty stroke with his next show, but he was the striker who sent in the defence splitting pass from which the match-winner emerged.\n\nOn Tuesday, India paid a heavy price for missing the first-choice first runner Amit Rohidas, under suspension for the Red Card he had received in the quarter-finals against Great Britain. India tried their best to get him reinstated for the semifinal, filing an appeal against the decision to debar him from the semi-final as well. But the Jury of Appeal decided to support the umpire and the ban stayed.\n\nIndia seemed to have committed a tactical error in deciding to fall back and defend in the last quarter. Hoping to repeat the act of the quarter-final against Britain was not an ideal plan. India may have managed to hold Britain from scoring by packing their defence, but the Germany had analysed the Indian tactics minutely. When falling back to defend, India yielded ground that benefitted Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cause.\n\nIt was still credible that India did not go down without a fight even till the final hooter. The last two minutes could have showcased India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fightback, but the misfiring strikers could not carry the day.\n\nTrailing by a goal, India took off their goalkeeper PR Sreejesh with just two minutes of play left. But they had to then face a penalty corner without the padded Sreejesh in the goal. India performed well by managing to defend that penalty corner shot for Germany \u00e2\u20ac\" even without a goalkeeper with pads on.\n\nGermany are not a team that will yield an inch when they have 11 players defending in their territory, yet India managed to create two chances in the very last minute of play \u00e2\u20ac\" only Shamsher Singh taking a wild swings and sending the ball ballooning over the cross-bar when the goalkeeper was stranded at the far post.\n\nThis defeat has the potential of leaving India rattled, but they need to regroup quickly to take on Spain in the bronze medal match.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_corner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

India enjoyed better possession in the first quarter, earning as many as seven penalty corners but could convert only one. Gradually the Germans seized the momentum.\n\nIndia had beaten Germany at the Tokyo Games bronze play-off to end a 41-year wait for an Olympic medal.\n\nThe last time time Indian hockey team reached the final of the Olympic Games was in 1980 Moscow Games.\n\nDespite not having key defender Amit Rohidas in the line-up, the Indian team fought hard and never looked like fizzling or succumbing to pressure.\n\nHarmanpreet (7th) and Sukhjeet (36th) scored for India while Gonzalo Peillat (18th) Christopher Ruehr (27th) and Marco Mitcau (54th) found the net for the winners.\n\nHardik entered the circle from the left and in no time created a penalty corner by landing a ball on the foot of a German defender but Jean-Paul Dannesburg blocked Harmanpreet's attempt.\n\nHowever, Hardik collected the rebound ball to earn one more chance but German custodian Jean-Paul Dennerberg again made a save.\n\nA Harmanpreet long hit touched the foot of a German defender, resulting in another penalty corner for India but it also went in vain.\n\nIndia continued to attack, getting three more chances and finally got on board on the sixth.\n\nHarmanpreet fired his shot that deflected off Martin Zwicker and ballooned into the goal post.\n\nJarmanpreet Singh then raised his stick in the air to stop a scoop from a German player, which was resulted in a penalty corner for dangerous play in the second quarter.\n\nAnd Germany were quick to neutralise the lead through Peillat's precision strike from a penalty corner.\n\nSoon after receiving a pass, Sumit made a terrific run from the left but was blocked by two German defenders.\n\nLalit Upadhyay also had a chance to double India's lead after receiving a ball from Abhishek, but he hit over the bar.\n\nIndia continued to attack as Mandeep Singh flew with the ball from the centre of the pitch, and passed it to Gurjant Singh inside the striking circle but he lost possession of the ball.\n\nThe Germans did not miss their chances when they got a penalty corner, which was converted into a penalty stroke as the goal-bound ball touched Jarmanpreet's foot.\n\nAnd Ruehr made no mistake in getting past Sreejesh's defence, firing one on his right side.\n\nIndia got a chance to level the score but fluffed two more penalty corners.\n\nHarmanpreet's shot was blocked by Dannerberg with his left hand and Hardik hit the rebound wide.\n\nA 10th penalty corner came India's way but it went abegging.\n\nThe score-levelling goal finally came from the stick of Sukhjeet, who deflected the dragflick of Harmanpreet from the team's 11th penalty corner.\n\nGermany got their chance to move ahead with their third penalty corner early into the fourth quarter when Harmanpreet obstructed a rival player.\n\nBut Sreejesh saved the chance, the rebound ball was again fired towards the Indian post but Ruehr's shot from the left was saved by Sanjay.\n\nThe Germans did not have to wait for their next chance but India's stout defence averted the danger.\n\nSreejesh's defence was, though, breached when Miltkau deflected a pass from Peillat from the right.\n\nIndia made several attempts to get the equaliser and even took Sreejesh off the field to inject one more player but it was not meant to be.

Despite playing a gallant game against reigning world champions Germany, India fell one goal short in the Olympic Games semi-final at the century-old Yves-du-Manoir Stadium. The Germans rode on a late goal to prevail 3-2 and advance to the title clash against The Netherlands, who outlayed Spain 4-0 in the other semi-final on Tuesday.\n\nGermany clinched victory through an open field deflection by Marbo Miltkau just six minutes from the hooter. Waiting for a cross from the left from Argentine import Gonzallo Peillat, which managed to split the defence that India had put up valiantly.\n\nIndian captain Harmanpreet Singh had opened the scoring with a penalty corner in the seventh minute, only to see Germany fire in two goals through Peillat's penalty corner conversion in the 27th minute and a penalty stroke conversion by Christopher Ruehr in the 27th. India rallied to equalise with Sukhjeet Singh's penalty corner deflection in the 36th minute, but the late field goal shattered their dream of playing the final.\n\nIndia continue to be in the hunt for their second successive bronze medal when they take of Spain in the play-off on Wednesday.\n\nIndia played without first rusher and defender Amit Rohidas after their efforts to get him reinstated for the semi-finals failed. India, however, took it in their stride and put up a brave fight.\n\nStarting on an attacking note, India forced two penalty corners within the initial two minutes. On the first penalty corner, Harmanpreet's firm grounder was looking for the left corner of the goal, but custodian Jean-Paul Hanneburg dived to clear with his outstretched stick. The next penalty corner flick posed no danger as the first rusher took away the sting from the shot.\n\nIndia then forced four penalty corners in a row in the seventh minute and finally breaching the German defence when Harmanpreet's rasping drag-flick went off a defender's stick into the net - to the delight of a stadium packed predominantly by Indian fans, who burst into celebrations.\n\nHarmanpreet directed the next shot wide of the post before Germany launched two brisk raids into the Indian circle, but did not get much leeway. India also came out to cause some concern to the German defence in the 11th minute when three strikers were trying to find a clear view of the goal, but were denied space.\n\nTrailing in the first quarter, Germany charged out to earn their first penalty corner in the 18th minute. Up stepped Germany's Peillat, who had immigrated from Argentina after winning them the 2016 Olympic gold medal with his deadly penalty corners. Peillat's first shot sounded the boards for the 1-1 equaliser.\n\nAt the other end, Abhishek muffed a good chance by shooting just wide to the right with the goalkeeper at his mercy. Soon after, Lalit Upadhyay could have put India ahead but scooped high over the cross-piece from the goalmouth. India were wasting chances that German defence rarely concedes, and they paid a penalty for it when a second German goal came through a penalty stroke conversion by Ruehr in the 27th minute.\n\nThe penalty stroke came off another dangerous drag-flick from Peillat, which struck defender Jarmanpreet's foot on the goalline.\n\nWithin six minutes of half-time, India had forced three penalty corners, pushing Germany to fall back. India could have equalised in the first minute after the interval when Harmanpreet's penalty corner flick rebounded off the goalkeeper. The ball went to Hardik Singh, who was under no time pressure, but his stinging shot went wide of the right post.\n\nIndia managed to draw 2-2 level in the 36th minute when Sukhjeet deflected Harmanpreet's penalty corner shot into the net, leaving the German defenders guessing.\n\nIndia were feeling the absence of the first-choice first rusher against Peillat, but they still managed to ward off three shots at the citadel on Germany's third penalty corner in the 46th minute, which India had challenged and lost their referral.\n\nThe Indian defence held their ground on Germany's next penalty corner, but was breached by Peillat's cross from the left in the 54th minute, which was deflected in by Miltkau.\n\nDesperate for an equaliser, India went all out, even took off the goalkeeper with two minutes left and also managed to defend a penalty corner without P.R. Sreejesh in the goal, But Germany held on to the lead, even when India had a last-gasp shy at their citadel in the dying seconds - only for the ball to go just wide.\n\nNetherlands win\n\nThe Netherlands stayed in the hunt for the top honours after a gap of five Olympic Games when they hammered Spain 4-0 under a scorching afternoon sun. Winners of back-to-back gold medals at Atlanta (1996) and Sydney (2000), The Netherlands have mounted their strongest challenge since losing the final at London (2012). The dominant Netherlands show in the semi-finals steamrolled the Spaniards, who had promised a keen contest after knocking out defending champions Belgium in the previous outing. The Dutch, however, repeated their dominance of the league encounter when they prevailed 5-3 against Spain.\n\nAfter two early raids by Spain, which saw Marc Reyne and Borja Lacalle take shots at the Dutch goal in the initial five minutes, the fast overlapping Netherlands laid seize on the Spanish citadel in the 12th minute. After the custodian blocked one shy at the goal, the scrimmage led to a penalty stroke due to a stick-check in the goalmouth. The penalty stroke was duly converted by Lars Balk with a firm shot to the boards.\n\nDutch captain Thierry Brinkman scored a peach of a goal when pounced on a ball in the circle and sent a rasping shot that went into the net to the left of goalkeeper Luis Calzado in the 20th minute. Spain forced the first of their five penalty corners in the last minute before half-time, but Dutch goalkeeper Pirmin Blaak dived to his right to deny the flick from Jose Maria Basterra.\n\nThe Spaniards were finding it tough to keep pace with the Netherlands. Even as they tried hard to build up attacks, Spain's own defence frequently kept crumbling. Two minutes into the second half, Spain's attempts to bounce back were dashed by Thijs van Dam when he picked a short pass in the circle and placed the ball in the left corner of the goal. This bolstered the Netherlands lead to three goals, which Spain never looked to neutralise today.\n\nThe Spanish performance was sub-par compared to the way they had played when knocking out title holders Belgium in the quarterfinals. Spain were awarded a penalty corner in the 48th minute when Ignacio Rodriguez was pushed down after collecting a diagonal back-pass in the goalmouth. The Dutch defensive wall, however, was not to be breached by two successive penalty corner shots.\n\nDuco Telgenkamp rounded off the Dutch scoring in the 51st minute by shooting home after receiving a square pass in the circle from Thijs van Dam.\n\nWith a humiliating defeat staring them in the face, Spain mounted a series of all-out raids, but failed to produce a goal-bearing shot as Netherlands tightened their defence. Despite participating in the most number of Olympics, Spain hunt for their first title remains unfulfilled.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"},

The world champions defeated India 3-2 to qualify for the gold medal match on August 6, Tuesday. India had taken the lead in the 7th minute only to see Gonzalo Peillat and Christopher Ruhr turn the tide of the game.\n\nSukhjeet would restore parity for India, before Marco Milktau would score the winner in the dying moments of the game to seal the win and progress to the final against Netherlands on August 8. India will be playing Spain in the bronze medal match.\n\nIndia started off the game early on and looked to be the better side in the first half having attack after attack on the German circle. India got a PC early on in the second minute as they were piling on the early pressure. While the first one was saved Hardik would get another one for India. That one would also get saved as Germany would look to launch an attack and the shot from Miltkau was saved by Sreejesh.\n\nThe pressure wasn't being reduced by the Indian team, who got 4 PCs in a row. The first 3 were saved by the first rusher but Harmanpreet, with a stroke of luck, put India in the lead in the 7th minute. India would then continue their dominance with another PC as the German defence was feeling the heat. Harmanpreet's shot was then dragged wide as Germany were looking for a way out.\n\nWhile the game did settle down a bit, India seemed like the team likely to score the next goal. When the first quarter came to an end, India had 66 percentage of the possession, 7 circle penetrations to Germany's 2 and 7 PCs as the world champions couldn't muster even one.\n\nThe second quarter needed to be a different one for Germany and they started on the attack and almost got a ball into the D which Kauffmann struggled to control. They would get their first PC in the 18th minute and Gonzalo Peillat made no mistake as the score was all level.\n\nIndia quickly shook off the cobwebs and started to be on the offensive once again and it was Abhishek who would get his signature shot at the German goal but it went well wide.\n\nLalit Upadhyay found himself in a glorious position to restore India's lead in the 23rd minute as he had just the goalkeeper in front of him. But his shot was well over the bar.\n\nGermany would get their second PC of the half in the 27th minute and the shot was stopped by Jarmanpreet with his foot and after a referral, it was awarded as a penalty stroke.\n\nRuhr would then make it 2-1 to turn the semi-final around.\n\nThe third quarter began with India putting the pressure back on and they got a PC early in the 31st minute. Harmanpreet's first attempt was blocked as India got another one. It was also stopped and Hardik's shot on the rebound went just wide.\n\nRajkumar with some good stick work earned another PC for India in the 34th minute and Harmanpreet continued to be denied by the German defence.\n\nAbhishek would get another PC as the count went to 12 for India. But this time a variation worked for India as Sukhjeet got the deflection into the net in the 36th minute to level things up at 2-2.\n\nGermany would be wakened up by India's equaliser and they would start to attack the Indian circle. They would have couple of chances which wouldn't trouble Sreejesh in goal.\n\nThere was Indian pressure in the final few minutes but nothing came of it as the hooter went off and we headed into the final quarter.\n\nGermany got a PC in the first minute of the 4th quarter after a slight fumble from Harmanpreet. There was commotion from the shot and Sanjay made an incredible block to keep the scores level in the 47th minute.\n\nThe match was really stretched and both teams were exchanging blow for blow as we slowly approached the final 10 minutes. India would lose possession and Wellen would almost make them pay. But Sreejesh was strong to make the save. Germany would take the referral and got a PC in the 51st minute.\n\nIndia were able to defend it well after Sreejesh made another big save but the possession still remained with the world champions. The pressure was on India and it paid off as Milktau was able to deflect the ball past Sreejesh after some good work on the left wing in the 54th minute.\n\nWith 5 minutes remaining, India decided to throw caution to the wind and go for the equaliser by committing more men forward. India would pull off Sreejesh and bring on a flying goalkeeper.\n\nIndia would launch one final attack and Lalit would fire his shot wide. Shamsher had the chance to be the hero, but his shot was inches wide as Germany returned to the gold medal match for the first time since 2012.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmanpreet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harmanpreet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzalo_Peillat", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gonzalo Peillat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhr", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ruhr"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Miltkau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marco Miltkau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_men's_national_field_hockey_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India men's national field hockey team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarmanpreet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jarmanpreet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalit_Upadhyay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lalit Upadhyay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shootout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shootout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Wellen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Niklas Wellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202408/paris-olympics-2024-064833111-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=XMbC7L31e2Y7I154O.dPY.VC8nBouflN", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795381", "eventUri": "eng-9795381", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 290, "textEnd": 298}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 612, "textEnd": 620}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

This victory is especially noteworthy as it marks India's first Olympic win over Australia in hockey since 1972.\n\nThe match saw striker Abhishek Nain score the opening goal in the 12th minute, putting India ahead 1-0. Harmanpreet Singh further solidified India's lead with a penalty corner goal and then converted a penalty stroke, ending the game with a final score of 3-2 in favor of India.\n\nHarmanpreet Singh: India's Wealthiest Hockey Player\n\nHarmanpreet Singh, celebrated as one of the world's premier drag flickers, is currently captaining the Indian field hockey team at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. This is his third Olympic appearance. Singh made his senior debut for India in 2015 against Japan and subsequently represented the nation at the 2016 Rio Olympics. His key contributions include helping India secure a bronze medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, a silver at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, and a gold medal at the 2022 Asian Games.\n\nNamed captain ahead of the 2022-2023 Pro League season, Singh has led the Indian team with distinction. He is recognized as the wealthiest hockey player in India, with an estimated net worth of $5 million (approximately Rs 42 crore), according to Zee News and publicly available data.\n\nSources of Income\n\nHarmanpreet Singh's wealth primarily stems from his international hockey career and his participation in the Hockey India League. In the 2015 league season, he was acquired by Dabang Mumbai for $51,000 (about Rs 42 lakh). Singh made a notable impact by scoring five goals and was honored with the 2015 Ponty Chadha Award for being the 'most promising player' of the tournament.\n\nUnlike some sports, Indian national hockey players do not have central contracts. Instead, they are compensated by the teams and organizations they represent. Additionally, players receive prize money for their achievements in major tournaments. For example, each member of the Indian hockey team that won a bronze medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics was awarded Rs 15 lakh by the Petroleum Sports Promotion Board, along with various other accolades.", "source": {"uri": "financialexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Financial Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fe_lifestyle@financialexpress.com", "name": "Fe Lifestyle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmanpreet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harmanpreet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_men's_national_field_hockey_team", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India men's national field hockey team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_corner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty corner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_hockey_at_the_2022_Asian_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Field hockey at the 2022 Asian Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_sevens_at_the_2022_Commonwealth_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rugby sevens at the 2022 Commonwealth Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shootout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shootout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's_singles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Badminton at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's singles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dabang_Mumbai", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dabang Mumbai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_India_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hockey India League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zee_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zee News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Field_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Field Hockey", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Roller_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Roller Hockey", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Hockey", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/hockkkeeeyyy.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795381", "eventUri": "eng-9795381", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Spain's Bruno Font suffered a muscle injury hours before the start of the game ruling him out from playing.\n\nAlthough they have not won the Gold, Spain has reached its first Olympic semi-final in this sport in 16 years. Now they will go head-to-head for the bronze medal.\n\nFans were enthusiasts of Captain Thierry Brinkman and accompanied his team from the Netherlands, where grass hockey is very popular. Women are also qualified and will compete in the semi-finals this Wednesday against Argentina.\n\nIf we take into account the results of Tuesday, the Netherlands is very well positioned, as their victory was 4-0, while the German margin was smaller: it beat India 3-2.\n\nFrom Germany, Gonzalo Peillat, Christopher Ruehr and Marco Miltkau scored as much; and in India were players Harmanpreet Singh and Sukhjett Singh. While the first quarter highlighted India, Germany soon topped the other quarters.\n\nThe final between Germany and the Netherlands will be played on Thursday at 2 p.m. and will be preceded by the bronze medal match between the losers of both, Spain, led by the Argentine Max Caldas, and India.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Argentine Leones will face the Netherlands in the semi-finals, a shock they face with a hunger for revenge against the team they fell within the last five Olympic dates. It will be an anticipated 'final' between the current world and Olympic champions, which are the Dutch, against the current sub-champions in both tournaments, the Argentine, which in turn are the first two teams in the world ranking.\n\nIt was precisely the Dutch women who deprived Argentina of glory in the final of Tokyo 2020 (3-1). Five years earlier, in Rio - the only of the last six Olympic events in which the Argentines did not play metal - the Netherlands was once again on its way to the quarterfinals (3-2).\n\nThe 'Orange' had already erected itself as an Argentine winner in women's lawn hockey by winning the final in the British capital in 2012, four years after being their winner in the semi-finals in Beijing-2008, and eight after being in the same round in Athens.", "source": {"uri": "insidethegames.biz", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.insidethegames.biz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "karate@insidethegames.biz", "name": "Karate", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombes", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colombes"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colombes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Miltkau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marco Miltkau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Brinkman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thierry Brinkman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmanpreet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harmanpreet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzalo_Peillat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gonzalo Peillat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIH_Men's_World_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIH Men's World Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximiliano_Caldas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maximiliano Caldas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Field_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Field Hockey", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Street_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Street Hockey", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Hockey", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://cdn.dmcl.biz/media/image/301602/o/Fans+inside+the+stadium+celebrate+following+Netherlands+victory+in+the+Men%27s+Semi+Final+match+against+Spain.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795381", "eventUri": "eng-9795381", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Sreejesh said the Indian team should grab its second chance to win a medal in the Paris Olympics instead of worrying about the 3-2 loss to World champion Germany in the semifinals of the hockey competition at the Yves du Manoir Stadium here on Tuesday.\n\nSreejesh, who would play his last international match in the third place encounter against Spain on Thursday, said winning a medal should be the team's priority.\n\n\"It's a medal match and it's not about me, it's about the country. It's about those 19 players and the staff. We will get a last opportunity to play, to get a medal for our country (and should focus on that) rather than worrying about what happened today,\" said Sreejesh.\n\nALSO READ | India's 'God in the goal' PR Sreejesh keeps the fire burning for hockey gold\n\nThe seasoned custodian admitted that India could not utilise its chances, including several penalty corners. \"We got our chances but did not convert many of those. You can see it in the scoreline. It's a matter of homework. They did a wonderful job against Harman (Harmanpreet Singh), how to tackle him. Because he's one of the best drag-flickers in the world and definitely that's what they've done against us.\n\n\"They fought like champions and I think (there was) some luck with them and they got it. But my players have done a wonderful job. They fought back, they really stood tall. Unfortunately, we couldn't finish it the way we wanted. It's not an easy deal.\"\n\nSreejesh was confident that the team would do well against Spain in the bronze medal match.\n\n\"We are tough. I believe we will bounce back in a better way. This consultation will have to be about how to fight that bronze medal match more than discussing this loss. We need to look at this match also because from there we will realise what went wrong and what we can do better. Because a lot of the opposition look into these kinds of matches, they learn how they can hurt us in certain ways. So, we need to find that out and we need to block that. Spain is not an easy team. They are real fighters. The way they played in the quarterfinals showed that we can't be in a relaxing chair,\" said Sreejesh.\n\nLatest on SportstarParis Olympics: PR Sreejesh urges India to fight for medal after semifinal loss to Germany Y.

Prize,\" Bhagwant Mann posted on X.\n\nA brace from skipper Harmanpreet Singh and PR Sreejesh's effortless saves secured a bronze medal for India at the Paris Olympics with a 2-1 win over Spain at the Yves du Manoir Stadium on Friday.\n\nIn an electrifying atmosphere, the Indian team added a fourth medal to their tally at the Paris Olympics, after being down 0-1 in the first quarter. Sreejesh, who was playing his last game for India, went to the ground, filled with emotions, as the rest of the team joined him to celebrate the momentous occasion in India's hockey history.\n\nIndia won consecutive bronze hockey medals for the first time in 52 years, since the 1972 Munich Games. Under the guidance of coach Craig Fulton, India made history by securing back-to-back bronze medals at the Olympics. Goals from Harmanpreet Singh (30', 33') were enough to see India across the finish line. For Spain, Marc Miralles (18') was the sole goal scorer.\n\nIndia had an upper hand in their head-to-head record against Spain at the Olympics. In their ten meetings, India had defeated the Spanish side seven times. Emotions ran high as India goalkeeper PR Sreejesh played his final international game. Hockey India honored him with the title of the 'God of Indian Modern Hockey' before the bronze medal match.\n\nWith the chants of 'India' echoing throughout the stadium, India tried to break down Spain's defense at the beginning of the first quarter.India had the first opportunity in the bronze medal match when Hardik passed the ball to Sukhjeet, who sent it wide of the goalpost.\n\nIndia punished Spain for not capitalizing on their chances and equalized before the second quarter. Captain Harmanpreet Singh converted a penalty corner with his trademark drag flick, passing the ball through Calzado and Rodriguez to make the score 1-1.\n\nIndia took the lead for the first time moments into the third quarter. It was yet another penalty corner for India, and Harmanpreet once again converted the opportunity to make it 2-1.\n\nIn the final 40 seconds, Spain earned a last-gasp penalty corner, giving them a chance to equalize, but Sreejesh stepped up with a flying save to seal the bronze medal for India.", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsX"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagwant_Mann", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bhagwant Mann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmanpreet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harmanpreet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chief_ministers_of_Punjab_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of chief ministers of Punjab (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_men's_national_field_hockey_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India men's national field hockey team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Miralles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marc Miralles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_pentathlon_at_the_1972_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Modern pentathlon at the 1972 Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_at_the_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain at the Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Fulton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Craig Fulton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goal (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_flick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drag flick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_corner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty corner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hockey India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(armed_forces)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (armed forces)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic_and_Regional", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic and Regional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/CH-4.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795381", "eventUri": "eng-9795381", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 460829369, "relevance": 2}

deaths being reported in Assam on Sunday.\n\nIn Uttarakhand, a girl was killed and her parents are missing following a landslide yesterday that buried their house.\n\nA massive landslide, triggered by a cloudburst, in Himachal Pradesh last night, buried two state roadways buses, killing at least 46 people and injuring several others at Kotpuri near Padhar on the Mandi-Pathankot national highway.\n\nAccording to officials, the toll may cross 50.\n\nRescue operations in Himachal after a massive landslide buried two state roadways buses.\n\nThe highway have been closed stranding hundreds of vehicles, they said, adding the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), the Army and the police were rushed to the spot.\n\nChief minister Virbhadra Singh, who visited the site, said the

The Army contingent from Ranchi would move to Purnia.\n\nBesides, 10 additional teams, each comprising 40-45 personnel of the NDRF, were also being deployed in flood-hit districts of Kishanganj, Purnia and Araria to strengthen the existing nine, NDRF battalion in Patna. A team each of the NDRF has already been deployed in East and West Champaran, Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, Supaul and Purnia districts, while two teams have been positioned at Kishanganj.\n\nThe Centre's help follows Bihar chief minister's talk with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Rajnath Singh and defence minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday. The chief minister also spoke to public representatives of these areas to assess the situation there.\n\nAddressing mediapersons on Sunday, Bihar chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh said the state government had also requested the Centre for choppers to assist in evacuation and rescue of the marooned. Airlifting of the marooned would begin from Kadamkhadi in Baisa block of Purnia district.\n\nOf the 10 NDRF teams being moved, he said four were expected to land at the Purnia Air Force base by Sunday afternoon. The teams were being moved from Mundali in Bhubaneswar.\n\nThe unprecedented rain in Nepal and its catchment areas during the last 72 hours had worsened Bihar's flood situation, as rivers such as the Mahananda, Gandak and Kankai were in spate.\n\nSingh said 1.75 feet rainfall was recorded in Kishanganj district due to the unprecedented rainfall in Nepal and Himalayan catchment areas in Bihar during the last three days. Kankai river, which did not have any water for the last 50 years, was also in spate in Kishanganj. The unprecedented rain had severely hampered communication, as most of the blocks and subdivisions were cut off with their district headquarters in Kishanganj.\n\nFlood waters had also entered the 60 relief camps opened in Kishanganj. \"These would now have to be moved to higher places,\" he added.\n\nThe chief secretary said it was a huge challenge for the state government to move the marooned to safer places and ensure safety of individuals and their belongings.\n\nPrincipal secretary, disaster management department, Pratyaya Amrit, said the state government was also evacuating people from Supaul who were trapped between embankments. Arrangements had also been made to airdrop food packets in flood-hit areas, he added.\n\nDirector-general of police P K Thakur, DG (homeguards) P N Rai, and principal secretaries Amir Subhani (home), Arun Kumar Singh (water resources) and Chanchal Kumar (chief minister's secretariat) were also present on the occasion.", "timeCrawl": "15:58:00", "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8936422", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "id": 253, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "id": 1182, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

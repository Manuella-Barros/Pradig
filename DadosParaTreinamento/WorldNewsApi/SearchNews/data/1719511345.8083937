The famous Golden Buzzer can be pressed by a judge or host when they want a particular act to go straight through to the live shows, meaning they skip past the boot camp stage of the competition, automatically giving them a head start. But rather than having one each, judge Amanda Holden revealed there are nine Golden Buzzers in this year\u2019s series alone, as she joked \u201cthe rule book has definitely gone out of the window\u201d. And BGT legend Paul - who won the very first series of the show in 2007 and is now an opera super star around the world \u2013 is not impressed, particularly as the Golden Buzzer wasn\u2019t even a thing when he entered the competition, as it wasn\u2019t introduced until series eight. Saying it \u201ctakes the shine off the show\u201d, the 53-year-old shared: \u201cThe more they put through on the Golden Buzzer, the less spots available in the semi-final, so it does take the shine off the Golden Buzzer a little bit..\" He continued in an interview with Sky Bingo: \u201cIt\u2019s awkward for the judges because of course they haven\u2019t seen all the acts, so they have to decide, do I use it now? Or do they end up giving it to someone who may not have deserved it as much. If it ends up being left to the last show, they might end up giving it to someone who may not have deserved it as much as someone else. \"It\u2019s a difficult decision to make. You\u2019re always going to have that situation, no matter how many Golden Buzzers you give them, because they are always going to hit their maximum. Personally, I think it should be one Golden Buzzer per judge, and obviously for Ant and Dec too, because otherwise it takes the shine off it a little.\u201d In the same interview, Paul also accused TV bosses of using a new format on Britain\u2019s Got Talent and \u201ctrying to turn it into Gogglebox\u201d. The newer format sees members of the audience microphoned up and asked to give their opinion on the acts performing on stage. But Paul thinks \u201cit\u2019s a little off-putting\u201d, as he explained: \u201cSuddenly they start talking and it takes away from stage time and actually viewing the acts.I don\u2019t know whether they are hoping to make it like Gogglebox. It\u2019s something they have done for four or five seasons now and it grates on me a little. It\u2019s one thing to mic people up the people with the acts \u2013 but to mic up a random person? I\u2019m not sure how natural that is.\u201d This weekend and the next week is huge for Britain\u2019s Got Talent fans. Saturday and Sunday is the last round of auditions and the live semi-finals start from Monday May 27, leading up to this year\u2019s winner finally being announced on Sunday June 2. The Golden Buzzer acts already in the semi-finals are West End singer and performer Sydnie Christmas, 28, who wowed the judges with her rendition of Tomorrow from the musical Annie. South Korean martial arts group, Ssaulabi Performance Troupe, received a standing ovation for their impressive audition. Japanese impressionist Nabe, who uses hair and props to make his creations of famous people and figures, also got a Golden Buzzer, as did music teacher for special needs, singer Taryn Charles. The other Golden Buzzer winners so far are eight-year-old brain tumour patient Ravi, who performed with his Dream Team choir including his sister, fellow patients and medical professionals, robot-style Japanese dance group, Cyberganet Legit, and dance group, Phoenix Boys. So does that mean there are more Golden Buzzers to be won this weekend? Sounds like there could be... *Britain\u2019s Got Talent continues on Saturday from 7.30pm and Sunday from 8pm on, with the semi-finals taking place the week starting Monday 27 May before the winner is announced on Sunday June 2 Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTubeand Threads Do you have a story to sell?

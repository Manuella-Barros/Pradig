manager Bruce Bochy said he wouldn't hesitate using reliever Hunter Strickland against Bryce Harper this weekend.\n\nStrickland said it wouldn't be an issue facing Harper for the first time since their May 29 brawl in San Francisco.\n\n\"I've got a job to do against whatever hitter's in the box,\" Strickland said Friday.\n\nStrickland served a six-game suspension for throwing at Harper in the last series between the teams, and Harper served three games for charging the mound. The incident came three years after Harper screamed at Strickland after hitting a home run in the 2014 NL Division Series.\n\n\"I think everybody's past it,\" Strickland said. \"We did the consequences and moved forward. Both teams are here to play ball.\"\n\nNationals manager Dusty Baker was asked about possible carryover.\n\n\"That's a long time, but it was a long time between the (2014) playoffs and the last time (in May), so who knows?\" Baker said. \"It's kind of on (Strickland). Bryce, he's not pitching. There's nothing we can do to him. He probably won't get an at-bat. So what are you going to do? You just play.\"\n\nStrickland drilled Harper with a first-pitch fastball, and Harper ran toward Strickland and threw his helmet. They exchanged haymakers, each connecting. Both got ejected.\n\nAs the combatants faced off, Giants teammates Michael Morse and Jeff Samardzija rushed to the scene and accidentally knocked heads, and Morse has had continuing concussion symptoms as a result.\n\nMorse hasn't played since and will visit the Giants' clubhouse in Miami on Tuesday and get checked out by the medical department. It's likely he won't play again.\n\nMelancon's return: Reliever Mark Melancon (pronator strain) is expected to be activated from the disabled list Saturday, but he won't immediately return to the closer's role.\n\nBochy plans to use Melancon, who hasn't pitched since June 27, in a lower-leverage situation at first.\n\nIn Melancon's absence, the closer's role has belonged to Sam Dyson, who was acquired from the Rangers and debuted with the Giants June 11.\n\nIn 23 games, Dyson has a 2.22 ERA with eight saves in nine opportunities.\n\nCueto throws: Right-hander Johnny Cueto played catch on flat ground for the first time since he was shut down with a strained flexor in his elbow during his July 31 rehab start.\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Nationals kept their fans wondering and waiting. And wondering and waiting. In the meantime, Giants players and coaches packed up and exited Nationals Park.\n\nFinally, more than a half hour after word got to the Giants' clubhouse that Friday night's game was rained out, the Nationals made the announcement to fans who had stuck around hoping they were going to watch baseball.\n\nThe game will be made up as part of a Sunday split double-header, the opener starting at 10:05 a.m. and the nightcap at 4:05 p.m.\n\nChris Stratton, who was supposed to pitch Friday, will start Saturday night. The Giants' Jeff Samardzija and Matt Moore will pitch the doubleheader.\n\nTeams can add a 26th player for the second game of doubleheaders, and it's possible the Giants will activate reliever Mark Melancon, who was scheduled to come off the disabled list anyway.\n\nFriday's rain started about 4 p.m., shortly before the scheduled first pitch, and the teams were informed more than two hours later that no game would be played.\n\nThe Nationals took a PR hit when failing to immediately tell fans, many of whom booed when the announcement was made.", "timeCrawl": "04:41:00", "sim": 0.8745098114013672, "extractedDates": [{"date": "-05-29", "textStart": 221, "amb": false, "textEnd": 227}, {"textStart": 1871, "date": "2017-06-27", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1878}, {"date": "-06-11", "textStart": 2051, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2058}, {"textStart": 2293, "date": "2017-07-31", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2300}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8743943", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "id": 134, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "id": 137, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Abstract", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Abstract", "id": 751, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Yard,_Deck,_and_Table_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Yard, Deck, and Table Games", "id": 1063, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

They have been without Adam Eaton since late April because of a torn ACL in his left knee that ended his season, Jayson Werth since early June because of a bruised left foot and Michael Taylor since July with a right oblique strain.\n\nThe Nationals lead the NL East by 14 games despite those injuries and more to starters Stephen Strasburg and Joe Ross, relievers Shawn Kelley and Koda Glover and shortstop Trea Turner, but a long-term injury to Harper would be far more trouble to Washington's postseason hopes.\n\nHarper is under contract through next season and can be a free agent in the winter of 2018.\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball", "timeCrawl": "03:27:00", "sim": 0.8588235378265381, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8867075", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities", "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "id": 143, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "id": 319, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "id": 811, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

"body": "Washington's Bryce Harper was helped in the dugout after he was injured during the first inning.\n\nWASHINGTON >> Bryce Harper injured his left knee when he slipped on a wet first base, a potentially devastating blow to the NL East-leading Washington Nationals.\n\nManager Dusty Baker said Harper hyperextended his left knee and was scheduled to have an MRI on Sunday.\n\n\"We just ask for prayers that it's not serious,\" Baker said after his team's 3-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants that was overshadowed by the injury to one of baseball's top players. \"He was in obvious pain, and he was praying and I was praying, too.\"\n\nHarper was limping but walking after the game. He was not made available to speak to reporters.\n\nStarter Edwin Jackson was upbeat that Harper was walking around. General manager Mike Rizzo is expected to provide an update on Sunday morning.\n\n\"Fortunate that he's up and walking,\" Jackson said. \"He's definitely one of those guys that you can't replace on a team. It's crazy but it's definitely great to see him up in spirit and walking around and know that he won't be significantly out for a period of time or just hurt period. He's doing great.\"\n\nWhile running out a ground ball to the right side of the infield in the first inning, Harper avoided contact with first baseman Ryder Jones and his left foot slipped on the base. His leg buckled, he went airborne and fell to the ground as his helmet went flying.\n\n\"I think (starter Jeff Samardzija) said he tried to extend the knee a little bit and try to catch the corner of the bag, and I think he might've slipped on the top,\" Jones said. \"It was a little wet. It didn't look good. I hope he's all right. It's just one of those freak plays where you kind of thought there would be a collision and there wasn't and that might be part of it, too.\"\n\nHarper clutched at his left knee after going down and was attended to by trainers. The star outfielder put no weight on his left leg as he was helped off the field by hitting coach Rick Schu and head athletic trainer Paul Lessard.\n\n\"He looked like he was in pretty good pain,\" Jones said. \"You never want that to happen to a player. ... Hopefully he's all right.\"\n\nBaker said his first reaction was to think about last September, when catcher Wilson Ramos tore the ACL in his right knee on a noncontact play after a rain delay. Baker said he hopes that's not the case with Harper.\n\nThe game began just after 10 p.m. following a 3-hour rain delay. It was raining steadily when Harper's injury happened.\n\nMajor League Baseball was in control of weather decisions because it's the Giants' final trip to Washington this season. The series opener Friday was postponed after a lengthy rain delay to be a part of a day-night doubleheader Sunday, adding to baseball's incentive of getting the game in today.\n\nBaker refrained from criticizing the league, saying the teams \"were kind of at the mercy of the schedule.\"\n\nBut the game is unlikely to have an impact on the playoff race, as the Nationals lead the NL East by 14\u00bd games and the Giants are out of contention. At the most, it could have an effect on home-field advantage in October.\n\nEven though first baseman Ryan Zimmerman is having an All-Star season, Washington's title hopes hinge largely on Harper's health. The 2015 MVP is having another spectacular season, hitting .327 with 29 home runs and 87 RBIs while playing in 105 of the Nationals' first 113 games.\n\nHarper didn't last long in his 106th game and was replaced by Andrew Stevenson, who took over in center field with Brian Goodwin moving to right. Despite many fans waiting out the delay, the stadium went eerily silent in the minutes after Harper's injury.\n\nBecause of a bevy of injuries, the Nationals have used 12 outfielders this season. They have been without Adam Eaton since late April because of a torn ACL in his left knee that ended his season, Jayson Werth since early June because of a bruised left foot and Michael Taylor since July with a right oblique strain.\n\nThe Nationals are running away with the division despite those injuries and more to starters Stephen Strasburg and Joe Ross, relievers Shawn Kelley and Koda Glover and shortstop Trea Turner, but a long-term injury to Harper would be far more trouble to Washington's postseason hopes.\n\nHarper is under contract through next season and can be a free agent in the winter of 2018.\n\n\"The good thing is he's young and strong,\" Baker said. \"I'm very optimistic that he'll be at least fine shortly.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball", "timeCrawl": "07:17:00", "sim": 0.8549019694328308, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8883851", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "id": 35, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "id": 36, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "id": 223, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "id": 381, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

(AP) -- Bryce Harper injured his left knee when he slipped on a wet first base, a potentially devastating blow to the NL East-leading Washington Nationals.\n\nManager Dusty Baker said Harper hyperextended his left knee and was scheduled to have an MRI on Sunday.\n\n\"We just ask for prayers that it's not serious,\" Baker said after his team's 3-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants that was overshadowed by the injury to one of baseball's top players. \"He was in obvious pain, and he was praying and I was praying, too.\"\n\nHarper was limping but walking after the game. He was not made available to speak to reporters.\n\nStarter Edwin Jackson was upbeat that Harper was walking around. General manager Mike Rizzo is expected to provide an update on Sunday morning.\n\n\"Fortunate that he's up and walking,\" Jackson said. \"He's definitely one of those guys that you can't replace on a team. It's crazy but it's definitely great to see him up in spirit and walking around and know that he won't be significantly out for a period of time or just hurt period. He's doing great.\"\n\nWhile running out a ground ball to the right side of the infield in the first inning, Harper avoided contact with first baseman Ryder Jones and his left foot slipped on the base. His leg buckled , he went airborne and fell to the ground as his helmet went flying.\n\n\"I think (starter Jeff Samardzija) said he tried to extend the knee a little bit and try to catch the corner of the bag, and I think he might've slipped on the top,\" Jones said. \"It was a little wet. It didn't look good. I hope he's all right. It's just one of those freak plays where you kind of thought there would be a collision and there wasn't and that might be part of it, too.\"\n\nHarper clutched at his left knee after going down and was attended to by trainers. The star outfielder put no weight on his left leg as he was helped off the field by hitting coach Rick Schu and head athletic trainer Paul Lessard.\n\n\"He looked like he was in pretty good pain,\" Jones said. \"You never want that to happen to a player. ... Hopefully he's all right.\"\n\nBaker said his first reaction was to think about last September, when catcher Wilson Ramos tore the ACL in his right knee on a noncontact play after a rain delay. Baker said he hopes that's not the case with Harper.\n\nThe game began just after 10 p.m. following a 3-hour rain delay. It was raining steadily when Harper's injury happened.\n\nMajor League Baseball was in control of weather decisions because it's the Giants' final trip to Washington this season. The series opener Friday was postponed after a lengthy rain delay to be a part of a day-night doubleheader Sunday, adding to baseball's incentive of getting the game in Saturday.\n\nBaker refrained from criticizing the league, saying the teams \"were kind of at the mercy of the schedule.\"\n\nBut the game is unlikely to have an impact on the playoff race, as the Nationals lead the NL East by 14\u00bd games and the Giants are out of contention. At the most, it could have an effect on home-field advantage in October.\n\nEven though first baseman Ryan Zimmerman is having an All-Star season, Washington's title hopes hinge largely on Harper's health. The 2015 MVP is having another spectacular season, hitting .327 with 29 home runs and 87 RBIs while playing in 105 of the Nationals' first 113 games.\n\nHarper didn't last long in his 106th game and was replaced by Andrew Stevenson, who took over in center field with Brian Goodwin moving to right. Despite many fans waiting out the delay, the stadium went eerily silent in the minutes after Harper's injury.\n\nBecause of a bevy of injuries, the Nationals have used 12 outfielders this season. They have been without Adam Eaton since late April because of a torn ACL in his left knee that ended his season, Jayson Werth since early June because of a bruised left foot and Michael Taylor since July with a right oblique strain.\n\nThe Nationals are running away with the division despite those injuries and more to starters Stephen Strasburg and Joe Ross, relievers Shawn Kelley and Koda Glover and shortstop Trea Turner, but a long-term injury to Harper would be far more trouble to Washington's postseason hopes.\n\nHarper is under contract through next season and can be a free agent in the winter of 2018.\n\n\"The good thing is he's young and strong,\" Baker said. \"I'm very optimistic that he'll be at least fine shortly.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball", "timeCrawl": "07:09:00", "sim": 0.8352941274642944, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8883095", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "id": 35, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "id": 36, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "id": 381, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

His leg buckled , he went airborne and fell to the ground as his helmet went flying.\n\nHarper clutched at his left knee after going down and was attended to by trainers. The star outfielder put no weight on his left leg as he was helped off the field by hitting coach Rick Schu and head athletic trainer Paul Lessard.\n\nThe game began just after 10 p.m. following a 3-hour rain delay. It was raining steadily when Harper's injury happened.\n\nMajor League Baseball was in control of weather decisions because it's the Giants' final trip to Washington this season. The series opener Friday was postponed after a lengthy rain delay to be a part of a day-night doubleheader Sunday, adding to baseball's incentive of getting the game in Saturday.\n\nBut the game is unlikely to have an impact on the playoff race as the Nationals lead the NL East by 14 games and the Giants are out of contention. At the most, it could have an effect on home-field advantage in October.\n\nEven though first baseman Ryan Zimmerman is having an All-Star season, Washington's title hopes hinge largely on Harper's health. The 2015 MVP is having another spectacular season, hitting .327 with 29 home runs and 87 RBIs this season and played in 105 of the Nationals' first 113 games.\n\nHarper didn't last long in his 106th game and was replaced by Andrew Stevenson, who took over in centre field with Brian Goodwin moving to right. Despite many fans waiting out the delay, the stadium went eerily silent in the minutes after Harper's injury.\n\nBecause of a bevy of injuries, the Nationals have used 12 outfielders this season. They have been without Adam Eaton since late April because of a torn ACL in his left knee that ended his season, Jayson Werth since early June because of a bruised left foot and Michael Taylor since July with a right oblique strain.\n\n\"There aren't many organizations that have 12 outfielders that they can really rely on and count on,\" manager Dusty Baker said Friday. \"Boy, that is a lot, especially when you only play three at a time. I'm just glad we have them.\"\n\nThe Nationals are running away with the division despite those injuries and more to starters Stephen Strasburg and Joe Ross, relievers Shawn Kelley and Koda Glover and shortstop Trea Turner, but a long-term injury to Harper would be far more trouble to Washington's post-season hopes.\n\nHarper is under contract through next season and can be a free agent in the winter of 2018.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball", "timeCrawl": "04:12:00", "sim": 0.8235294222831726, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8870791", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "id": 134, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "id": 135, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "id": 137, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "id": 205, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "id": 206, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "id": 641, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

(Ben Margot/Associated Press)\n\nThis weekend's three-game series at Nationals Park was supposed to be a possible playoff preview, a headline matchup to enliven August's dog days. But it will not be that. It will be a meeting between a first-place club not facing a real threat to its playoff chances (the Nationals) and a division doormat light years from the postseason picture with the third-worst record in baseball (the Giants).\n\nThe Nationals (68-45) returned home to beat the Marlins three out of four times this week to build a season-high 15-game lead in the National League East. The Giants (46-70) spent their off-day Thursday in Washington after taking two of three games from the Cubs in San Francisco. The series victory pulled them to within 35.5 games of the first-place Dodgers in the National League West and 19.5 games of the Diamondbacks for the second wild card spot.\n\nANY BAD BLOOD LEFT?\n\nThere's a strong chance Bryce Harper and Hunter Strickland will stand 60 feet, 6 inches from each other at some point this weekend. The question is whether Harper will feel the need to run the distance to confront Strickland with haymakers again.\n\nMost likely, no. Most likely, if the two face off, Strickland will not throw the baseball at Harper. He probably ejected that yearning from his system back on Memorial Day, when, nearly three years after Harper admired a long home run he hit off Strickland in the 2014 NLDS, he intentionally plunked Harper at AT&T Park. Harper sprinted at Strickland, sparking a brawl. Harper was originally suspended four games, but the ban was reduced to three games after appeal. Strickland was suspended for six games. His wasn't reduced.\n\nThe two combatants have gone on to continue standout seasons. Harper is a contender for his second NL MVP in three years with 29 home runs and a 1.036 on-base-plus-slugging-percentage. Strickland, meanwhile, has been one of the few positives in San Francisco's nightmare season. The right-hander has a 2.09 ERA in 48 appearances.\n\nJeff Samardzija, whose attempt to spear Harper during the fiasco was sabotaged by a violent collision with teammate Michael Morse, will pitch Saturday. Morse, a former National, suffered a concussion ramming into Samardzija and hasn't played since.\n\nMELANCON COULD RETURN\n\nThe Giants prioritized upgrading their disastrous bullpen over the offseason above all, and emerged with Mark Melancon, one of the three big-name closers on the market. The right-hander was signed away from the Nationals for $62 million over four years. It was the largest contract ever given to a closer until the Yankees signed Aroldis Chapman for five years, $86 million a few days later.\n\nMelancon became a free agent at the right time -- just after revolutionary bullpen usage was one of the postseason's main story lines -- and was rewarded for a dominant four-year stretch, which included a 1.64 ERA and 47 saves for the Pirates and Nationals last season. He was to shore up the back end of San Francisco's awful bullpen. Instead, he's compiled a 4.35 ERA in 22 games, and hasn't pitched since June 22 because of a pronator strain in his pitching elbow. San Francisco is reportedly expected to reinstate him this weekend, perhaps as early as Friday.\n\nSam Dyson has assumed the bulk of the closing duties in Melancon's absence. The right-hander, acquired from the Rangers in June, has a 2.22 ERA in 22 games since joining the Giants.\n\nGIANT FREEFALL\n\nIt's difficult to fathom that the Giants were a catastrophic bullpen collapse away from pushing the Cubs to the brink in the NLDS last fall. Or maybe it isn't. While the Giants tested the eventual World Series champions last season, they floundered in the second half, which, in hindsight, may have been a precursor this season's stunning downfall. Since the 2016 all-star break, the Giants are 76-112 during the regular season. They haven't been good for over a year.\n\nMajor injuries haven't helped their chances of turning things around. Right-hander Johnny Cueto (finger) and first baseman Brandon Belt (concussion) are on the disabled list. Ace Madison Bumgarner spent much of the season on the DL after injuring his shoulder in a dirt-bike accident in Colorado in April. He has made six starts since returning on July 15, pitching to a 2.52 ERA. The Nationals will not see him this weekend.\n\nBut injuries don't mask the letdowns across the roster. While the rest of baseball is clubbing home runs at a historic rate, the Giants are last in the majors with 92, which is 16 fewer than the next-lowest total. Their third basemen were so bad they brought back Pablo Sandoval, whom the Red Sox discarded despite owing him roughly $50 million. They rank 17th in team ERA even though they play half their games in the pitching-friendliest park in the majors. The misery culminated in AT&T Park's sellout streak ending at 530 games last month. The problems, in short, run deep for the last-place club.\n\nPITCHING PROBABLES\n\nFriday: RHP Chris Stratton vs. RHP Edwin Jackson\n\nSaturday: RHP Jeff Samardzija vs. RHP Max Scherzer\n\nSunday: LHP Matt Moore vs. RHP A.J.

Bryce Harper injured his left knee when he slipped on a wet first base, a potentially devastating blow to the NL East-leading Washington Nationals.\n\nManager Dusty Baker said Harper hyperextended his left knee and was scheduled to have an MRI on Sunday.\n\n\"We just ask for prayers that it's not serious,\" Baker said after his team's 3-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants that was overshadowed by the injury to one of baseball's top players. \"He was in obvious pain, and he was praying and I was praying, too.\"\n\nHarper was limping but walking after the game. He was not made available to speak to reporters.\n\nStarter Edwin Jackson was upbeat that Harper was walking around. General manager Mike Rizzo is expected to provide an update on Sunday morning.\n\n\"Fortunate that he's up and walking,\" Jackson said. \"He's definitely one of those guys that you can't replace on a team. It's crazy but it's definitely great to see him up in spirit and walking around and know that he won't be significantly out for a period of time or just hurt period. He's doing great.\"\n\nWhile running out a ground ball to the right side of the infield in the first inning, Harper avoided contact with first baseman Ryder Jones and his left foot slipped on the base. His leg buckled , he went airborne and fell to the ground as his helmet went flying.\n\n\"I think (starter Jeff Samardzija) said he tried to extend the knee a little bit and try to catch the corner of the bag, and I think he might've slipped on the top,\" Jones said. \"It was a little wet. It didn't look good. I hope he's all right. It's just one of those freak plays where you kind of thought there would be a collision and there wasn't and that might be part of it, too.\"\n\nHarper clutched at his left knee after going down and was attended to by trainers. The star outfielder put no weight on his left leg as he was helped off the field by hitting coach Rick Schu and head athletic trainer Paul Lessard.\n\n\"He looked like he was in pretty good pain,\" Jones said. \"You never want that to happen to a player. ... Hopefully he's all right.\"\n\nBaker said his first reaction was to think about last September, when catcher Wilson Ramos tore the ACL in his right knee on a noncontact play after a rain delay. Baker said he hopes that's not the case with Harper.\n\nThe game began just after 10 p.m. following a 3-hour rain delay. It was raining steadily when Harper's injury happened.\n\nMajor League Baseball was in control of weather decisions because it's the Giants' final trip to Washington this season. The series opener Friday was postponed after a lengthy rain delay to be a part of a day-night doubleheader Sunday, adding to baseball's incentive of getting the game in Saturday.\n\nBaker refrained from criticizing the league, saying the teams \"were kind of at the mercy of the schedule.\"\n\nBut the game is unlikely to have an impact on the playoff race, as the Nationals lead the NL East by 14 1/2 games and the Giants are out of contention. At the most, it could have an effect on home-field advantage in October.\n\nEven though first baseman Ryan Zimmerman is having an All-Star season, Washington's title hopes hinge largely on Harper's health. The 2015 MVP is having another spectacular season, hitting .327 with 29 home runs and 87 RBIs while playing in 105 of the Nationals' first 113 games.\n\nHarper didn't last long in his 106th game and was replaced by Andrew Stevenson, who took over in centre field with Brian Goodwin moving to right. Despite many fans waiting out the delay, the stadium went eerily silent in the minutes after Harper's injury.\n\nBecause of a bevy of injuries, the Nationals have used 12 outfielders this season. They have been without Adam Eaton since late April because of a torn ACL in his left knee that ended his season, Jayson Werth since early June because of a bruised left foot and Michael Taylor since July with a right oblique strain.\n\nThe Nationals are running away with the division despite those injuries and more to starters Stephen Strasburg and Joe Ross, relievers Shawn Kelley and Koda Glover and shortstop Trea Turner, but a long-term injury to Harper would be far more trouble to Washington's post-season hopes.\n\nHarper is under contract through next season and can be a free agent in the winter of 2018.\n\n\"The good thing is he's young and strong,\" Baker said. \"I'm very optimistic that he'll be at least fine shortly.\"", "timeCrawl": "06:37:00", "sim": 0.8078431487083435, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8880409", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "id": 36, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "id": 134, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "id": 381, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "id": 641, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "id": 811, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The incident came three years after Harper screamed at Strickland after hitting a home run in the 2014 Division Series.\n\n\"I think everybody's passed it,\" Strickland said. \"We did the consequences and moved forward. Both teams are here to play ball.\"\n\nNationals manager Dusty Baker was asked about possible carryover.\n\n\"That's a long time, but it was a long time between the (2014) playoffs and the last time (in May), so who knows?\" Baker said. \"It's kind of on (Strickland). Bryce, he's not pitching. There's nothing we can do to him. He probably won't get an at-bat. So what are you going to do? You just play.\"\n\nAfter Harper's Game 1 homer off Strickland in the NLDS, Strickland said he wouldn't be afraid to throw Harper another fastball. Harper homered again off Strickland in Game 4, admired it and yelled at Strickland while rounding the bases.\n\nThe next time they faced, May 29, Strickland drilled him with a first-pitch fastball. Harper ran toward Strickland and threw his helmet. They exchanged haymakers, each connecting. Both got ejected.\n\nAs the combatants faced off, Giants teammates Michael Morse and Jeff Samardzija rushed to the scene and accidentally knocked heads, and Morse has had continuing concussion symptoms as a result.\n\nMorse hasn't played since and will visit the Giants' clubhouse in Miami on Tuesday and get checked out by the medical department. It's likely he won't play again.\n\nHarper is hitting .327 with 29 homers and 87 RBIs.

Giants players were already leaving the stadium several minutes before the announcement was made, a half-hour lag in Major League Baseball informing the teams and fans getting the notice.\n\nGiants manager Bruce Bochy was informed around 9:15 of the postponement, which was announced on the Nationals' Twitter account and in the press box at 9:47 and in the stadium at 9:52.\n\n''If I put nine guys out there, do I win?'' Bochy said, jokingly.\n\nGiants players were already in street clothes talking to family and friends and walking toward the team buses before the game was announced as postponed. Bochy spoke to reporters before the announcement was made.\n\nThe latest bizarre weather situation comes at Nationals Park, which famously had a three-hour, no-rain rain delay against the Atlanta Braves on July 6. That game started after 10 p.m., with a sparse crowd in attendance, a repeat that was spared Friday night.\n\nBochy was set to give catcher Buster Posey a rare day off Friday and said he'll keep him out of the lineup Saturday.\n\nThe Nationals and Giants will play at 1:05 and 7:05 p.m. Sunday.\n\nBAKER AND BOTCHY\n\nAs a result of the rainout, Nationals manager Dusty Baker will have to wait another day to catch Bochy on the all-time wins list. Bochy leads all active managers with 1,835 victories, and though Baker has a higher regular-season winning percentage, Bochy has three World Series rings.\n\nAlong with being rivals, Baker and Bochy are friends. Baker said Bochy was the first one to call him when he was fired by Cincinnati, and Baker called in April when Bochy had a heart procedure.\n\n''I don't think he has any fear,'' Baker said. ''He knows what he's doing. He's got some brains in that big ol' head he's got. He's a smart man.''\n\nBochy succeeded Baker as Giants manager in 2007 and has enjoyed facing him for the better part of two decades.\n\n''We enjoy our battles and being competitive against each other,'' Bochy said.

But it's been 2 1/2 months since then, and it really didn't stem from any beef between the Nats and Giants as a whole, but rather from San Francisco reliever Hunter Strickland, who three years after serving up two playoff homers to Bryce Harper decided to intentionally drill him with a fastball.\n\nThus, Baker doesn't expect emotions to be running too high tonight or over the remainder of the weekend ... as long as Strickland doesn't instigate anything else.\n\n\"I didn't even think about it, really,\" Baker said this afternoon. \"I mean, that's a long time. But there was a long time between the playoffs and last time. So who knows? It's kind of on him. Bryce, he's not pitching. There's nothing that we can do to him, because he probably won't get an at-bat. So what are you going to do? You just play.\"\n\nBoth players have already served suspensions for their actions in the May 29 brawl at AT&T Park. Harper served a three-game suspension later that week after his appeal reduced Major League Baseball's original penalty by one game. Strickland's appeal of his six-game suspension was denied, and so he served it in its entirety earlier this summer.\n\nJeff Samardzija does start Saturday night's game, which could possibly provoke some emotions out of the Nationals, given the right-hander's reaction to the fight. Samardzija was the most aggressive member of the Giants charging out of the dugout and appeared to be making a beeline for Harper before teammate Michael Morse got in his way. The two Giants collided, banging heads, and Morse suffered a concussion in the process.\n\nMorse, hugely popular in Washington even five years after he last played here, has remained on the disabled list ever since, and Giants manager Bruce Bochy suggested to reporters today that Morse is unlikely to return to play this season. Given the fact he nearly retired before, this could prove the end of his career.\n\nMeanwhile, closer Mark Melancon is set to be be activated off the DL on Saturday, giving the right-hander a chance to pitch at Nationals Park. Melancon, who spent the last two months of 2016 as the Nationals closer before signing a four-year, $62 million contract with the Giants over the winter, has been out with a pronator strain in his elbow. He has a 4.35 ERA in 22 appearances this season.\n\nUpdate: \"Approaching inclement weather\" has prompted the Nationals to delay the start of tonight's game. The team has not yet predicted a new start time.\n\nUpdate II: Tonight's game is postponed due to rain.

"isDuplicate": false, "body": "Hunter Strickland and Bryce Harper could meet again this weekend. (Kelley L Cox'/USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe Nationals and Giants will begin a three-game series Friday night at Nationals Park, which means, with very little at stake between first-place Washington (68-45, 15-game lead in the NL East) and last-place San Francisco (46-70, 19 games out of a playoff spot), one of the prevalent story lines is the animosity between Hunter Strickland and Bryce Harper.\n\nOdds are the two face will each other at some point this weekend. The last time they met, on Memorial Day at AT&T Park, Strickland plunked Harper because he didn't appreciate Harper's long admiration of a home run in the 2014 NLDS. Harper knew it was intentional and charged the mound, throwing his helmet at Strickland before the two exchanged haymakers in a rare legitimate baseball brawl. Harper received a four-game suspension, which was later reduced to three games upon appeal. Strickland was suspended for six games.\n\nSo will any tension carry over? Nationals Manager Dusty Baker said that's up to Strickland.\n\n\"I didn't think about it really,\" Baker said. \"That's a long time, but it was a long time between the playoffs and the last time. So who knows, it's kind of on him. Bryce, he's not pitching, so there's nothing that we can do to him because he probably won't get an at-bat. So what are you going to do? You just play.\"\n\nStrickland has been one of the very few bright spots in a lost season for the Giants. He has a 2.09 ERA in 48 games, though he's walking 5.2 batters per nine innings for a bullpen that hasn't allowed an earned run in its last 18 2/3 innings.\n\nHis performance has helped San Francisco better absorb the loss of closer Mark Melancon, who hasn't pitched since June 22 because of a strained elbow.

Harper needed help getting up and was carried off the field by hitting coach Rick Schu and trainer Paul Lessard, the Nationals' postseason hopes resting largely on the All-Star right fielder.\n\nThe base was slippery following a 3-hour, 1-minute rain delay. Friday's scheduled opener was postponed because of rain, so the first pitch of the series, Edwin Jackson to Denard Span, was delivered 27 hours late.\n\nJones beat Harper to the base, and pitcher Jeff Samardzija lunged out of the way at the last moment to avoid contact.

Giants players were already leaving the stadium several minutes before the announcement was made, a half-hour lag in Major League Baseball informing the teams and fans getting the notice.\n\nGiants manager Bruce Bochy was informed around 9:15 p.m. local time of the postponement, which was announced on the Nationals' Twitter account and in the press box at 9:47 and in the stadium at 9:52.\n\n\"If I put nine guys out there, do I win?\" Bochy said, jokingly.\n\nGiants players were already in street clothes talking to family and friends and walking toward the team buses before the game was announced as postponed. Bochy spoke to reporters before the announcement was made.\n\nThe latest bizarre weather situation comes at Nationals Park, which famously had a three-hour, no-rain rain delay against the Atlanta Braves on July 6. That game started after 10 p.m., with a sparse crowd in attendance, a repeat that was spared Friday night.\n\nBochy was set to give catcher Buster Posey a rare day off Friday and said he would keep him out of the lineup Saturday.\n\nThe Nationals and Giants will play at 10:05 a.m. and 4:05 p.m. Sunday, Pacific time.\n\nBAKER AND BOTCHY\n\nAs a result of the rainout, Nationals manager Dusty Baker had to wait another day to catch Bochy on the all-time wins list. Bochy was leading all active managers with 1,835 victories. Though Baker has a higher regular-season winning percentage, Bochy has three World Series rings.\n\nAlong with being rivals, Baker and Bochy are friends. Baker said Bochy was the first one to call him when he was fired by Cincinnati, and Baker called in April when Bochy had a heart procedure.\n\n\"I don't think he has any fear,\" Baker said. \"He knows what he's doing. He's got some brains in that big ol' head he's got.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass)\n\nHarper was limping but walking after the game. He was not made available to speak to reporters.\n\nStarter Edwin Jackson was upbeat that Harper was walking around. General manager Mike Rizzo is expected to provide an update on Sunday morning.\n\n\"Fortunate that he's up and walking,\" Jackson said. \"He's definitely one of those guys that you can't replace on a team. It's crazy but it's definitely great to see him up in spirit and walking around and know that he won't be significantly out for a period of time or just hurt period. He's doing great.\"\n\nWhile running out a ground ball to the right side of the infield in the first inning, Harper avoided contact with first baseman Ryder Jones and his left foot slipped on the base. His leg buckled , he went airborne and fell to the ground as his helmet went flying.\n\n\"I think (starter Jeff Samardzija) said he tried to extend the knee a little bit and try to catch the corner of the bag, and I think he might've slipped on the top,\" Jones said. \"It was a little wet. It didn't look good. I hope he's all right. It's just one of those freak plays where you kind of thought there would be a collision and there wasn't and that might be part of it, too.\"\n\nHarper clutched at his left knee after going down and was attended to by trainers. The star outfielder put no weight on his left leg as he was helped off the field by hitting coach Rick Schu and head athletic trainer Paul Lessard.\n\n\"He looked like he was in pretty good pain,\" Jones said. \"You never want that to happen to a player. ... Hopefully he's all right.\"\n\nBaker said his first reaction was to think about last September, when catcher Wilson Ramos tore the ACL in his right knee on a noncontact play after a rain delay. Baker said he hopes that's not the case with Harper.\n\nThe game began just after 10 p.m. local time following a 3-hour rain delay. It was raining steadily when Harper's injury happened.\n\nMajor League Baseball was in control of weather decisions because it's the Giants' final trip to Washington this season. The series opener Friday was postponed after a lengthy rain delay to be a part of a day-night doubleheader Sunday, adding to baseball's incentive of getting the game in Saturday.\n\nBaker refrained from criticizing the league, saying the teams \"were kind of at the mercy of the schedule.\"\n\nBut the game is unlikely to have an impact on the playoff race, as the Nationals lead the NL East by 14\u00bd games and the Giants are out of contention. At the most, it could have an effect on home-field advantage in October.\n\nWashington Nationals' Bryce Harper, second from right, is helped off the field after he was injured during the first inning of a baseball game against the San Francisco Giants, Saturday, Aug. 12, 2017, in Washington.

Stevenson, a six-foot outfielder from LSU, had just 15 at-bats this season under his belt before the Harper injury.\n\nThere's no telling how long Harper could be out as of now.

Samardzija tossed in an 0-2 offering, which Harper pulled to the right side. Giants first baseman Ryder Jones dove and stopped the play. He then began a foot race against Harper. Jones reached the base first for the out, but as soon as Harper's left foot touched the bag, he went airborne. His legs twisted awkwardly underneath his body and he catapulted past the base, landing in the dirt. Harper clutched his left knee in agony as trainers came out to assist.\n\nNationals manager Dusty Baker came out of the dugout with his hands sitting on his cap in disbelief.\n\n\"We just ask for prayers that it's not serious,\" Baker told reporters after the game, according to MLB.com. \"We're just urging everybody out there that are Nationals fans and baseball fans to say a prayer for him tonight because he was in obvious pain out there. We're just hoping for the best.\"\n\nNationals general manager Mike Rizzo said Sunday that an MRI revealed no structural damage is Harper's knee.\n\n\"Although we feel we've dodged a bullet a bit here with any long-term ligament and tendon damage, the bone bruise is something of significance,\" Rizzo said, according to the Washington Post. \"And we're going to treat him cautiously and hopefully have him back later on this season.\"\n\nThe Bryce Harper injury #Nats #MLB @dcsportsbog pic.twitter.com/mMiI5S3rJe -- Brad P (@TheBradParker)\n\nAugust 13, 2017\n\nThe Nationals currently have \"no timeline whatsoever\" for Harper's return, according to Rizzo.

It is hard to forget the last moment of your major league career.\n\nMichael Morse sustained a concussion when he tried to separate Harper and Strickland, and ended up knocking heads with Giants pitcher Jeff Samardzija.\n\nMorse was diagnosed with the concussion the day after the May 29 fight, and placed on the disabled list. That is where he remains, out of sight and out of mind after going back to his family in the Miami area.\n\nBochy said he tried to call Morse earlier this week, and he heard from the training staff that the former World Series hero would visit the team at Marlins Park on Tuesday.\n\nThere has been no discussion of putting Morse on the active roster as a September call-up, Bochy said. It appears his career is over at this point.\n\nThe collision with Samardzija ended a second act that probably wouldn't have lasted much longer, anyway. The Giants conceded the season in the following weeks, and as great a story as Morse was when he came out of retirement to bash the ball in spring training, he wouldn't have served much purpose on a team that is looking to the future with younger players.\n\nStill, for a player who was hugely popular in both Washington and San Francisco, it is a sad and unfortunate way for things to end. Awkward, too.\n\nIn the aftermath of the fight, Harper thanked Morse, a former teammate, for preventing him from getting sucker punched.\n\n\"I'm kind of thankful that Mikey Mo and Samardzija collided, because Samardzija saw blood a little bit, I thought,\" Harper said at the time. \"I'm very thankful for Mikey Mo.\"\n\nWas Morse coming to the defense of a former teammate instead of supporting his current mates? Was he ostracized as a result?\n\nIt's hard to make that claim when so many other Giants wanted nothing to do with Strickland's assault to avenge a three-year-old grudge that dated back to the 2014 NL Division Series. Catcher Buster Posey stood behind the plate and watched as Harper charged the mound and sidearm-chucked his helmet. Giants infielders kept their distance, too.\n\nSamardzija was the first to reach the two combatants - and he appeared to have a clenched fist guided at Harper's jaw before he and Morse knocked heads in a swirl of waving, brown hair.\n\nThere probably won't be any escalation of tensions in this three-game series at Nationals Park. The Giants and Nats played two games after the Harper-Strickland fight without incident, even though Samardzija started one of them. Both Strickland and Harper served their suspensions.\n\nMost likely, it'll be business as usual - and while it could get interesting if Strickland faces Harper, I'd wager that Bochy won't let that happen. His pitcher went rogue on him once already. Managers do not like to have their authority challenged.\n\nFor Morse, though, the consequences of that fight continue to linger.", "timeCrawl": "22:21:00", "sim": 0.7490196228027344, "extractedDates": [{"date": "-05-29", "textStart": 738, "amb": false, "textEnd": 744}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8711318", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "id": 32, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Individual_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Individual Parks", "id": 235, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "id": 566, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic", "id": 653, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

rained out Friday night, meaning the start of the series is pushed back to Saturday.\n\nFriday's game will be made up as part of a day-night doubleheader on Sunday.\n\nThe Giants (46-70) are making their only trip of the year to Washington. The Nationals are 68-45.\n\nEdwin Jackson (2-2, 3.75 ERA with Washington) was slated to face Chris Stratton (0-2, 6.63) of the Giants in the pitching matchup Friday, and both will start Saturday.\n\nJackson is 4-4 with a 5.03 ERA in 11 games (10 starts) against the Giants. He was 2-0 with a 2.92 ERA in two starts last year against San Francisco. Stratton will face the Nationals for the first time.\n\nJeff Samardzija (7-11, 4.75 ERA), originally slated to pitch for the Giants on Saturday, would most likely pitch one of the games Sunday.\n\nThe rain delayed for a day a possible meeting between Giants right-handed reliever Hunter Strickland and Washington right fielder Bryce Harper.\n\nStrickland drilled Harper with a pitch in April and Harper charged the mound, resulting in a brawl and suspensions for both players.\n\n\"I didn't even think about it, really,\" Nationals manager Dusty Baker said Friday. \"I mean, that's a long time. But there was a long time between the playoffs and last time. So who knows? It's kind of on him. Bryce, he's not pitching. There's nothing that we can do to him, because he probably won't get an at-bat. So what are you going to do?\"\n\nBaker was referring to the 2014 playoffs when Harper went deep against Strickland.\n\nGiants manager Bruce Bochy said Friday that he would not hesitate to use Strickland to face Harper if need be this weekend.\n\nWhat about the April fight?\n\n\"I forgot about it before you brought it up,\" Bochy told a reporter Friday.\n\nGiants closer Mark Melancon (right pronator strain) was with the team Friday in Washington and Bochy said \"he could be activated Saturday.\"\n\nThe former Washington closer threw one inning and fanned two on Wednesday for Class A Advanced San Jose in a minor league rehab outing.\n\nIt was his fourth rehab appearance overall, with three coming with San Jose and one with Triple-A Sacramento. He is 1-2 with a 4.35 ERA with 11 saves in 22 games this year for the Giants.\n\nSan Francisco first baseman Brandon Belt (seven-day concussion) did not travel with team this weekend and there is no timetable for his return, according to the Giants. He is hitting .241 in 104 games with 18 homers. Belt is eligible to come off the disabled list on Saturday.\n\nGiants left-hander Matt Moore (3-12, 5.88) was originally slated to start Sunday against the Nationals. He could now pitch one of the two games Sunday.\n\nWashington has benefited in the last few weeks from new relievers Sean Doolittle, Ryan Madson and Brandon Kintzler. \"You feel a lot more comfortable,\" Baker said of the trio, all of whom having closing experience.\n\nGame notes\n\nGiants LF Jarrett Parker was set to play in his first game at Nationals Park before the rainout. He grew up in nearby Stafford, Va., and played at the University of Virginia. ... Giants manager Bruce Bochy spent part of his youth in Falls Church, Va. ... Washington manager Dusty Baker was the skipper of the Giants from 1993 to 2002 and won 840 games there. ...

several decades, as both have strong California roots.\n\nBochy also played and managed the San Diego Padres and Baker played for the Los Angeles Dodgers and was the manager of the Giants from 1993 to 2002.\n\n\"I have tremendous respect for Dusty,\" Bochy said this weekend.\n\n\"When I lost my job in Cincinnati (in 2013) he was the first one to call -- wanted to know what happened because we had just gone to the playoffs,\" Baker said.\n\nTheir current teams will meet for the last time this season when the Nationals host a day-night doubleheader against the Giants on Sunday. The second game will be a makeup of the game that was rained out Friday in the nation's capital.\n\nBochy and Baker both have 1,835 career wins following the first game of the series, which the Nationals won, 3-1. Lou Piniella also won 1,835 games as a manager.\n\nNot everything about Saturday's game was positive for Washington, as Bryce Harper left the game with a knee injury in the first inning.\n\n\"We know he hyperextended it when he slipped going across the bag. He's going to get an MRI,\" Baker said of Harper. \"We just ask for prayers that it's not serious. We're just urging everybody out there that are Nationals fans and baseball fans to say a prayer for him tonight because he was in obvious pain out there. We're just hoping for the best.\"\n\nThe Nationals announced Sunday that Harper avoided structural damage in his injured left knee, but he will be out indefinitely because of a significant bone bruise. The team placed Harper on the 10-day disabled list with a hyperextended left knee.\n\nFirst-place Washington (69-45) will send right-handers A.J. Cole (1-2, 5.63 ERA) and Max Scherzer (12-5, 2.23) to the mound Sunday while the last-place Giants (46-71) counter with righty Chris Stratton (0-2, 6.63) and left-hander Matt Moore (3-12, 5.88).\n\n\"We enjoy our battles and being competitive against each other,\" said Bochy, whose team was swept by the Nationals in April in San Francisco and is 0-4 against Washington this year.\n\nBochy has won three World Series titles as a manager. Baker won two as a player and is trying to get his first as a manager in the final year of his two-year contract in Washington.\n\n\"We know each other real well because we were in the same division for a number of years when he was in San Diego and I was in San Francisco,\" Baker said. \"I don't think he has any fear. And he knows what he's doing. He's got some brains in that big old head he got. He's a smart man.\"\n\nScherzer is 3-4 with a 4.76 ERA in seven career starts against the Giants. He pitched a complete-game victory in his start against the Giants this year, giving up one run and five hits.\n\nCole, making the fourth start of the season, has never faced the Giants. In his previous start, at home against the Miami Marlins, he gave up a three-run homer to Giancarlo Stanton and took the loss Tuesday.\n\nMoore is 0-1 with a 3.00 ERA in two starts against Washington and Stratton has never faced the Nationals. In his only start against Washington this season, Moore allowed two runs and six hits in seven innings and took the loss.\n\nHarper, the National League MVP in 2015, left the game in the last of the first inning Saturday after his left foot slipped on the first base bag as he tried to beat out a groundball to first baseman Ryder Jones.\n\nOn the play, Jones fielded the ball and beat Harper to the bag as pitcher Jeff Samardzija raced over to cover the bag just in case. Harper fell to the ground and held his left knee for several minutes. He was helped off the field and did not put any weight on his left leg as athletic trainer Paul Lessard and hitting coach Rick Schu helped him to the clubhouse.\n\nHarper was walking under his own power in the Washington clubhouse at about 1:45 a.m. on Sunday.\n\nThe start of the game was delayed 3 hours, 1 minute by rain Saturday and there was a light rain falling as Harper batted in the first.", "timeCrawl": "16:35:00", "sim": 0.7411764860153198, "extractedDates": null, "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8940974", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities", "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "id": 143, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Multiplayer", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Multiplayer", "id": 1009, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

It does not look good, though when it comes to injuries, it's always best to wait for the doctor's diagnosis rather than make guesses. The team has not yet made any announcements about the injury.\n\nEarlier this year the Nationals lost Adam Eaton on a similar play at first base. He lunged for the bag and suffered a serious knee injury that ended his season. Washington is also without Jayson Werth (foot), Ryan Raburn (trap), and Michael Taylor (oblique), so they're running short on outfielders at the moment.\n\nHarper, 24, is a top NL MVP candidate this season.

(Greg Fiume/Getty Images)\n\nBryce Harper exited the Nationals' series opener against the Giants at Nationals Park late Saturday night with an apparent left knee injury during the first inning. The injury occurred when Harper attempted to beat out a groundball to first. The right-fielder lunged for first base and slipped on the bag. He immediately grabbed his left knee while falling to the ground and writhed in pain behind first base.\n\nHarper remained on the ground for a few minutes as the ballpark went silent. Hitting coach Rick Schu and trainer Paul Lessard then helped him off the field. Harper didn't put any weight on his left leg and had his head down as he was assisted off the field and through the Nationals dugout. It was reminiscent of the scene in the same area behind first base on April 29, when Adam Eaton sustained a season-ending knee injury, also trying to beat out a groundball.\n\nThe play occurred minutes into a game that started at 10:06 p.m. -- after a three-hour, one-minute rain delay. The rain slowed from its earlier levels, but continued through the first inning. Wet conditions could've played a factor in Harper slipping. Last season, Nationals catcher Wilson Ramos suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament after a rain delay one week before the playoffs started.\n\nFor all of the Nationals' injuries, and there have been plenty of them, they've been able to avoid anything catastrophic since Eaton tore his anterior cruciate ligament The big boppers in the middle of the order have stayed relatively healthy and the top four in the rotation have avoided major problems, though Stephen Strasburg is one of Washington's 11 players on the disabled list.\n\nThis story will be updated.", "timeCrawl": "03:05:00", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "extractedDates": [{"date": "-04-29", "textStart": 835, "amb": false, "textEnd": 843}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8865420", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "id": 319, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "id": 811, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

By the time they saw their first pitch at Nationals Park, it was after 10 p.m. on Saturday.\n\nBut there are worse things than waiting through rain delays and postponements. Much, much worse.\n\nThe ballpark fell into stunned silence in the first inning of the Nationals' 3-1 victory when star player Bryce Harper stomped on a wet first base, his cleat slid, his left knee buckled and he went flying as if violently ejected from a moving vehicle.\n\nHarper's face twisted in agony as he held his left knee. It took a trainer and a base coach to assist him off the field. All the while - down the dugout stairs, then down the tunnel to the clubhouse -- he put no weight on his injured left leg.\n\nThe Nationals' best hope is that Harper sustained nothing beyond a hyperextension. Anything worse would mean torn ligaments, and surgery, and a significant handicap in October for a team that should coast to its fourth NL East title in five years yet thus far has failed to advance beyond the best-of-5 NL Division Series.\n\nAnd it would mean that Major League Baseball's greatest stage would be deprived one of its most talented and recognizable players -- one of few legitimate and marketable stars who resonate beyond casual fans of the game.\n\nHarper entered the game ranked fourth in the NL in hitting (.326), fourth in on-base percentage (.419), third in slugging (.619) and second in OPS (1.034). Only the Rockies' Charlie Blackmon had scored more runs. He had 29 homers and was on pace to hit 41 while driving in 124.\n\nIt was the first time the Giants and Nationals crossed paths since the late May series at AT&T Park, and the benches-clearing incident that was window dressing for a one-on-one confrontation between Harper, right-hander Hunter Strickland and the reliever's three-year grievance. Strickland, apparently still displeased that Harper yelled at him after hitting a home run in the 2014 NLDS, threw a fastball to the hip, Harper charged the mound and fists flew as the rest of the Giants - including catcher Buster Posey initially held back as if behind invisible ropes.\n\nJeff Samardzija was the one Giants player who had Harper in his sights. He sprinted over the dugout rail and had a balled fist trained on Harper's jaw before he collided with Giants first baseman Michael Morse - a knocking of heads that put Morse on the disabled list with a concussion that likely will end his career.\n\nOddly enough, Samardzija was the nearest body to Harper when his foot slipped on first base Saturday night. Harper had hit a ground ball to the right side and first baseman Ryder Jones made a lunging stop before racing to the bag. He did a credible job of clearing the lane for Harper, and Samardzija, who had raced over to cover, also veered away from a potential collision.\n\nThere was no malice. Only moisture. The Nationals delayed the first pitch for a half-hour and had the field tarped under partly sunny skies because of an approaching thunderstorm. With a split doubleheader looming Sunday, the last thing these teams wanted was to start Saturday's game and lose both starting pitchers to a lengthy delay after two or three innings.\n\nSo they waited three hours before the storm could pass and the field could be prepped.\n\nHarper's loss will be felt by a team that is on pace to win 97 games yet will enter October as nobody's favorite because of the historic dominance that has happened at Dodger Stadium this season.\n\nThe Nationals are seeking to avenge their NLDS loss to the Dodgers last year in a series that went to a decisive fifth game, and a one-run loss when Clayton Kershaw came out of the bullpen to record the final two outs.\n\nIt was the latest October disappointment for the Nationals' Dusty Baker, who has become the Greg Norman of major league managers, toothpick and wristbands included.\n\nBaker, 68, has managed eight teams to the postseason but is still chasing his first ring as a skipper; his only pennant came with the 2002 Giants, who came so tantalizingly close before he took the ball from Russ Ortiz in Game 6 at Anaheim and watched the Angels brush past him that night and the next.\n\nHe was the Cubs' manager in 2003 for the Bartman game. He was the Reds' manager in 2012 when the Giants rattled off three consecutive elimination wins in Cincinnati. Yet the Nationals did not see an October inadequacy when they picked him to take them to the next level.\n\nDuring Baker's two years between jobs, Giants manager Bruce Bochy passed him on the all-time managerial victories list. This season, with the Giants off in a ditch, Baker is set to pass him once more.\n\nBaker entered Saturday night with 1834 wins in 22 seasons - one short of matching Bochy and Lou Piniella for 14th on the all-time list. Of the 13 managers ahead of them, only Gene Mauch is not in the Hall of Fame.\n\nThere's a good chance Baker passes Bochy in this series. His best pitcher, Max Scherzer, will take the mound against Chris Stratton for Game 1 of Sunday's doubleheader, which was pushed up to 10:05 a.m. PDT so the Nationals can clear the ballpark between games. Game 2 (Matt Moore vs. A.J. Cole) will begin at 4:05 p.m. PDT.\n\nIt means the Giants will have a late night flight to Miami before their series opener there on Monday. And they won't have a rested starter to take the ball on Wednesday. They could use Matt Cain or Albert Suarez to run the first leg of a bullpen game.\n\n--\n\nJoe Panik hit a solo home run in the first inning but the Giants offense once again struggled against Edwin Jackson, whose fastball and slider also proved puzzling when he was with the San Diego Padres. Samardzija gave up two runs on three hits in the first inning, and then Adam Lind hit an RBI double in the sixth as the Nationals stopped his three-start win streak. Samardzija threw 120 pitches in six innings.\n\n--\n\nThe Giants activated right-hander Mark Melancon (right forearm pronator strain) from the disabled list and placed infielder Miguel Gomez (knee) on the 10-day DL. Melancon pitched the eighth - his first game since June 27 - and he hit 93 mph while pitching around a hit in a scoreless inning. Melancon struck out one and his other outs came on a nubber to the mound and a pop-up.\n\n--\n\nThe Giants and Nationals are allowed to add a 26th man to the roster for Game 2 on Sunday. Relievers on the 40-man roster include Derek Law, Steven Okert and Reyes Moronta.", "timeCrawl": "05:23:00", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 6105, "date": "2017-06-27", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 6112}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8875308", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "id": 134, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "id": 135, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "id": 137, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "id": 205, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "id": 206, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "id": 641, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The second game will be a makeup of the game that was rained out Friday in the nation's capital.\n\nBochy and Baker both have 1,835 career wins following the first game of the series, which the Nationals won, 3-1.

He's going to get an MRI,\" Baker said of Harper. \"We just ask for prayers that it's not serious.

He pitched a complete-game victory in his start against the Giants this year, giving up one run and five hits.\n\nCole, making the fourth start of the season, has never faced the Giants. In his previous start, at home against the Miami Marlins, he gave up a three-run homer to Giancarlo Stanton and took the loss Tuesday.\n\nMoore is 0-1 with a 3.00 ERA in two starts against Washington and Stratton has never faced the Nationals. In his only start against Washington this season, Moore allowed two runs and six hits in seven innings and took the loss.\n\nHarper, the National League MVP in 2015, left the game in the last of the first inning Saturday after his left foot slipped on the first base bag as he tried to beat out a groundball to first baseman Ryder Jones.\n\nOn the play, Jones fielded the ball and beat Harper to the bag as pitcher Jeff Samardzija raced over to cover the bag just in case.

Giants players were already leaving the stadium several minutes before the announcement was made, a half-hour lag in Major League Baseball informing the teams and fans getting the notice.\n\nGiants manager Bruce Bochy was informed around 9:15 of the postponement, which was announced on the Nationals' Twitter account and in the press box at 9:47 and in the stadium at 9:52.\n\n\"If I put nine guys out there, do I win?\" Bochy said, jokingly.\n\nGiants players were already in street clothes talking to family and friends and walking toward the team buses before the game was announced as postponed. Bochy spoke to reporters before the announcement was made.\n\nThe latest bizarre weather situation comes at Nationals Park, which famously had a three-hour, no-rain rain delay against the Atlanta Braves on July 6.

Bochy leads all active managers with 1,835 victories, and though Baker has a higher regular-season winning percentage, Bochy has three World Series rings.\n\nAlong with being rivals, Baker and Bochy are friends. Baker said Bochy was the first one to call him when he was fired by Cincinnati, and Baker called in April when Bochy had a heart procedure.\n\n\"I don't think he has any fear,\" Baker said. \"He knows what he's doing. He's got some brains in that big ol' head he's got. He's a smart man.\"\n\nBochy succeeded Baker as Giants manager in 2007 and has enjoyed facing him for the better part of two decades.\n\n\"We enjoy our battles and being competitive against each other,\" Bochy said. \"I have tremendous respect for Dusty.\"\n\nGiants: Bochy said closer Mark Melancon could be activated Saturday.

false, "body": "Following a three-hour rain delay, the Nationals lost right fielder Bryce Harper to a left knee injury when he slipped on first base as he tried to beat out a grounder in the first inning.\n\nHarper could not put weight on his left leg and was helped off the field by trainer Paul Lessard and Nationals hitting coach Rick Schu.\n\nThe Nationals defeated the Giants 3-1, but the concern now is the status of their 2015 National League MVP for the rest of the season.\n\nManager Dusty Baker said Harper suffered a hyperextended left knee and will undergo an MRI Sunday morning.\n\nWith one out and Wilmer Difo on second in the bottom of the first, Harper sent a grounder towards Giants first baseman Ryder Jones. Jones and Harper raced to first base and Jones got there first for the out.\n\n\"It was one of those plays where I went to flip and (Jeff \"Shark\" Samardzija) wasn't there,\" Jones recalled. \"I think he thought maybe he could beat it out for a knock. I think Shark said he tried to extend the knee a little bit and try to catch the corner of the bag, and I think he might've slipped on the top. It was a little wet, it didn't look good. I hope he's alright. It's just one of those freak plays where you kind of thought there would be a collision and there wasn't and that might be part of it too, maybe he was trying to doge me and Samardzija.\n\n\"The top of the bases were wet obviously from the rain. It looked like we were about to collide because Samardzija was kind of right there too. Just a freak accident. I guess we'll find out what happened to him, but it didn't sound too good. He looked like he was in pretty good pain. You never want that to happen to a player. Hopefully he's alright.\"\n\nNationals first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, who smacked an RBI double in the at-bat after Harper was helped off the field, feels for his fallen teammate and was reminded of the injury to Adam Eaton at first base in April. Eaton is recovering from a torn ACL and other leg damage. \"Obviously you don't want anyone on your team to get hurt,\" Zimmerman said. \"He's a big part of the team. Any time something like that happens after already going through something like that earlier in the year, it's not good to see that.\"\n\nManager Dusty Baker, like Zimmerman, thought about a late season injury to one of his players that was similar to the way Harper hit the ground. He hopes it's not the same injury that felled catcher Wilson Ramos at home plate last season.\n\n\"My first thought was to think about Ramos last year down the stretch,\" Baker said. \"So I'm hoping that's not the case.\n\n\"We just ask for prayers that it's not serious. We're just urging everybody out there that are Nationals fans and baseball fans to say a prayer for him tonight because he was in obvious pain out there. We're just hoping for the best.\"\n\nWith the rain making the grounds wet, and the fact that it appeared Harper slipped on a wet first base bag as he stretched for the play, did Baker think they shouldn't have started the game with the field still saturated by a three-hour rain?\n\n\"No, no. It was in the hands of the league, really,\" Baker said. \"The unbalanced schedule here, this is their last trip in. You had to try to play the game. This is their only time in with the unbalanced schedule, so we were kind of at the mercy of the schedule.\"\n\nBaker described what he saw when he approached Harper.\n\n\"He was in obvious pain, and he was praying and I was praying, too,\" Baker said. \"He was talking to the Master. That's what we usually do when things are in a bad way. The good thing is he's young and strong. I'm very optimistic that he'll be at least fine shortly.\"\n\nAfter the game, starter Edwin Jackson was optimistic that maybe the Harper knee injury wasn't as serious as some might have thought when they initially saw the injury occur.\n\nHarper was seen leaving the clubhouse with just a slight limp. Jackson (3-2), who pitched six innings and allowed just one run on five hits to pick up the win, said it was nice to see Harper moving around in the clubhouse after the injury.\n\n\"When you see a caliber of player like that or any player go down like that, you hope for the best,\" Jackson said. \"And fortunate that he's up and walking.

Rizzo said Sunday that Harper had an MRI afterward that showed no structural damage.\n\n\"Although we feel we've dodged a bullet a bit here with any long-term ligament and tendon damage, the bone bruise is something of significance, and we're going to treat him cautiously and hopefully have him back later on this season,\" Rizzo said. \"We put ourselves in a position that we can treat it cautiously and we'll continue down that road.\"\n\nWashington Nationals' Bryce Harper, center, is helped in the dugout after he was injured during the first inning of the team's baseball game against the San Francisco Giants, Saturday, Aug. 12, 2017, in Washington.

The team is placing him on the 10-day disabled list and activating outfielder Michael Taylor.\n\nHarper, the 2015 National League MVP, is having another spectacular season for division-leading Washington, hitting .326 with 29 home runs and 87 RBIs.\n\nRizzo - and anyone watching the play - feared it was a serious, potentially season-ending injury. Harper clutched at his left knee and didn't put any weight on it as he was helped off the field.\n\n\"We were all holding our breath last night a little bit and hoping for the best,\" Rizzo said. \"Got a glimmer of hope last night when he was able to walk up the stairs from the dugout to the clubhouse and put some weight on it. Had some optimism.\"\n\nRizzo cautioned that \"the bone bruise is real\" and that the team has the luxury of being extra cautious because of its 14\u00bd-game lead in the NL East. Given injuries to Harper, Stephen Strasburg - who has a rehab assignment Monday - and others, the Nationals' focus is getting healthy for the playoffs.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\nWashington Nationals' Bryce Harper grabs his knee after he was injured running to first during the first inning of the team's baseball game against the San Francisco Giants, Saturday, Aug. 12, 2017, in Washington.

"score": 3}], "time": "06:07:00", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "WASHINGTON -- Bryce Harper sustained what appeared to be a serious left knee injury when he slipped on a wet first base and his left leg buckled while running out a grounder early in the Washington Nationals' 3-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Saturday night.\n\nHarper clutched at his knee while on the wet field and put no weight on his left leg as he was helped off. The 2015 NL MVP left the game immediately, and manager Dusty Baker said Harper hyperextended his knee.\n\n\"He was in obvious pain and he was praying and I was praying, too,\" said manager Dusty Baker, adding that Harper would have an MRI.\n\n\"I'm asking for prayers that it's not serious,\" Baker said.\n\nThe result of the game meant little for Washington, which leads the NL East by 14 \u00bd games, or San Francisco, which is out of contention. It didn't begin until 10:06 p.m. after another extended weather delay, and it was raining when Harper lost his footing on a base that had water on it.\n\nThe Nationals lost catcher Wilson Ramos to a torn ACL in his right knee in late September last season, another noncontact injury that came after a rain delay in Washington.\n\nIf Harper is out, it's a more devastating injury to the Nationals' World Series hopes than when Ramos' season ended prematurely a year ago. Harper is hitting .326 with 29 home runs and 87 RBIs as the most fearsome hitter in the league.\n\nWith Harper out, the Nationals got their offense in the form of RBI doubles from Ryan Zimmerman and Adam Lind, and an RBI single from Daniel Murphy off Giants starter Jeff Samardzjia (7-12).\n\nRight-hander Edwin Jackson (3-2) allowed one earned run on five hits and struck out five in six innings before giving way to Washington's newfound lockdown bullpen trio of Brandon Kintzler, Ryan Madson and Sean Doolittle.\n\nWHAT IF?\n\nWith the Nationals cruising toward another playoff appearance and Lind and Brian Goodwin playing well, manager Dusty Baker was asked what he might do when Jayson Werth (bruised left foot) and Michael Taylor (strained right oblique) are healthy.\n\n\"I thought about it but not in-depth because there's so many things that can happen between now and then,\" Baker said, roughly seven hours before Harper went down. The Nationals have already used 12 outfielders this season.\n\nMELANCON BACK\n\nGiants manager Bruce Bochy wanted to make sure Mark Melancon's first appearance off the disabled list didn't come in a high-leverage situation after the $62 million closer missed more than six weeks with a right forearm strain. He was able to do that, as Melancon allowed one hit and had one strikeout against his most recent team in the eighth inning, his first work since June 27.\n\nSTRASBURG REHAB\n\nNationals right-hander Stephen Strasburg will make a minor league rehab start Monday at Class A Potomac.\n\nStrasburg has been on the disabled list since late July with a right elbow nerve impingement. Pitching coach Mike Maddux said that Strasburg is likely to throw about five innings and 75 pitches in his first rehab outing.\n\nStrasburg took part in a simulated game earlier in the week, and Maddux said the 29-year-old looked \"really good\" and now has to build up his stamina.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nGiants: To make room on the roster for Melancon, the INF Miguel Gomez went on the 10-day DL, retroactive to Aug. 9, with right knee inflammation.\n\nNationals: Strasburg is one of 11 Nationals players currently on the DL, and Baker doesn't want to rush anyone back. Baker said outfielder Taylor doesn't have his timing yet and reliever Shawn Kelley (back) isn't as sharp as trainers would like yet. ...

Heavy rainfall had visited the D.C. area for much of the evening.\n\nThe Nationals, up 14 games on the Marlins in the standings, have essentially locked up the National League East with more than a month left in the season.

Baseball's postseason is susceptible to wild, random swings, but if Harper weren't 100 percent for the Nationals' run, it'd be an enormous blow to a team that relies heavily on him to mash.\n\nHarper has rebounded this year after a down 2016. The 2015 NL MVP had 29 home runs and a triple-slash line of .327/.420/.616 entering Saturday. He's not mashing at quite the pace he did during that MVP year, but he's returned to his perch as one of the greatest hitters in the sport.

when Bryce Harper hit the first-base bag and tumbled onto the ground in the last of the first inning late Saturday night.\n\nMany of the Nationals fans who stayed around after a three-hour rain delay saw possible postseason hopes become bleak. When Harper left the stadium, he was walking on his own power in the Nationals' clubhouse around 1:45 a.m. Sunday morning after a 3-1 win by the Nationals over the San Francisco Giants.\n\nHarper has a hyperextended left knee after getting hurt on a groundout. The 2015 National League MVP will have an MRI later Sunday, Washington manager Dusty Baker said.\n\nGiants manager Bruce Bochy said, \"I don't know what happened really. It looked like he slipped on the bag. It might have been wet or something. Hopefully, he is OK. He is a key player for Washington and you hate to see anybody get hurt. I certainly hope it is not too bad.\"\n\nEdwin Jackson, the Washington starter and winner, said, \"You hope for the best. It is good to see him walking around\" the clubhouse.\n\nJackson allowed just one run in six innings, Adam Lind was 3 for 3 with an RBI and Ryan Zimmerman had two hits and drove in a run for Washington.\n\n\"Somehow he has our number. Pitching for San Diego last year, he pitched well against us. He did a job on us,\" Bochy said of Jackson. \"He's got good stuff.\"\n\nBut the pitching of Jackson and hitting of Lind was overshadowed by the Harper injury.\n\n\"We know he hyperextended it when he slipped going across the bag. He's going to get an MRI,\" Baker said. \"We just ask for prayers that it's not serious. We're just urging everybody out there that are Nationals fans and baseball fans to say a prayer for him tonight because he was in obvious pain out there. We're just hoping for the best.\"\n\nJackson (3-2) gave up five hits before Brandon Kintzler took over and pitched a scoreless seventh.\n\nRyan Madson allowed a double to Buster Posey but pitched a scoreless eighth for Washington. Left-hander Sean Doolittle threw a perfect ninth for his eighth save with the Nationals.\n\nDoolittle was one of three University of Virginia products in the game, along with Washington first baseman Ryan Zimmerman (2 for 3 with a walk) and Giants left fielder Jarrett Parker (1-for-4).\n\nVirginia was in the news Saturday for the racial unrest that took place. A moment of silence was observed before the game for the victims of the clash.\n\nGiants starter Jeff Samardzija (7-12), who had won his previous three starts, gave up three runs and nine hits in six innings and threw a less than ideal 120 pitches.\n\n\"He really competed well. He threw a lot of pitches. He kept us in the game there,\" Bochy said.\n\nWilmer Difo also had two hits for Washington. The Nationals are 69-45 and the Giants are 46-71, including 0-4 this year against Washington.\n\nJoe Panik hit a solo homer off Jackson in the first inning to give the visitors a 1-0 lead. It was the seventh homer of the season for Panik, who had gone 79 at-bats since his last homer on July 15 at San Diego.\n\nWashington scored two runs in the last of the first take a 2-1 lead even though Harper was injured in the process.\n\nZimmerman had an RBI double and Daniel Murphy drove in a run with a single after Harper, the third batter for the Nationals, left the game.\n\nHarper left after his left foot slipped on the first base bag as he tried to beat out a ground ball to first baseman Ryder Jones.\n\nHarper fell to the ground and held his left knee for several minutes. He was helped off the field and did not put any weight on his left leg as athletic trainer Paul Lessard and hitting coach Rick Schu helped him to the clubhouse.\n\nThe start of the game was delayed three hours, one minute by rain Saturday and there was a light rain in the first inning.\n\nHarper is hitting .326 with 29 homers and 89 RBIs in 106 games and 402 at-bats for the first-place Nationals, who entered the day 14 1/2 games ahead of the second-place Miami Marlins in the National League East.\n\nThe Nationals lost center fielder Adam Eaton for the season in late April when he also hit the bag in a strange way at first base at home. Washington hopes the same fate doesn't happen to Harper.\n\n\"He was in obvious pain, and he was praying and I was praying, too. He was talking to the Master. That's what we usually do when things are in a bad way. The good thing is he's young and strong. I'm very optimistic that he'll be at least fine shortly,\" Baker said.\n\nNOTES: Giants RHP Mark Melancon, who pitched a scoreless eighth inning, was activated off the disabled list and INF Miguel Gomez (right knee inflammation) was placed on the 10-day disabled list, retroactive to Aug. 9. ...

when he slipped on a wet first base and his left leg buckled while running out a grounder early in the Washington Nationals' 3-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Saturday night.\n\nHarper clutched at his knee while on the wet field and put no weight on his left leg as he was helped off. The 2015 NL MVP left the game immediately, and manager Dusty Baker said Harper hyperextended his knee.\n\n\"He was in obvious pain and he was praying and I was praying, too,\" said manager Dusty Baker, adding that Harper would have an MRI.\n\n\"I'm asking for prayers that it's not serious,\" Baker said.\n\nThe result of the game meant little for Washington, which leads the NL East by 14 \u00bd games, or San Francisco, which is out of contention. It didn't begin until 10:06 p.m. after another extended weather delay, and it was raining when Harper lost his footing on a base that had water on it.\n\nThe Nationals lost catcher Wilson Ramos to a torn ACL in his right knee in late September last season, another noncontact injury that came after a rain delay in Washington.\n\nIf Harper is out, it's a more devastating injury to the Nationals' World Series hopes than when Ramos' season ended prematurely a year ago. Harper is hitting .326 with 29 home runs and 87 RBIs as the most fearsome hitter in the league.\n\nWith Harper out, the Nationals got their offense in the form of RBI doubles from Ryan Zimmerman and Adam Lind, and an RBI single from Daniel Murphy off Giants starter Jeff Samardzjia (7-12).\n\nRight-hander Edwin Jackson (3-2) allowed one earned run on five hits and struck out five in six innings before giving way to Washington's newfound lockdown bullpen trio of Brandon Kintzler, Ryan Madson and Sean Doolittle.\n\nWHAT IF?\n\nWith the Nationals cruising toward another playoff appearance and Lind and Brian Goodwin playing well, manager Dusty Baker was asked what he might do when Jayson Werth (bruised left foot) and Michael Taylor (strained right oblique) are healthy.\n\n\"I thought about it but not in-depth because there's so many things that can happen between now and then,\" Baker said, roughly seven hours before Harper went down. The Nationals have already used 12 outfielders this season.\n\nMELANCON BACK\n\nGiants manager Bruce Bochy wanted to make sure Mark Melancon's first appearance off the disabled list didn't come in a high-leverage situation after the $62 million closer missed more than six weeks with a right forearm strain. He was able to do that, as Melancon allowed one hit and had one strikeout against his most recent team in the eighth inning, his first work since June 27.\n\nSTRASBURG REHAB\n\nNationals right-hander Stephen Strasburg will make a minor league rehab start Monday at Class A Potomac.\n\nStrasburg has been on the disabled list since late July with a right elbow nerve impingement. Pitching coach Mike Maddux said that Strasburg is likely to throw about five innings and 75 pitches in his first rehab outing.\n\nStrasburg took part in a simulated game earlier in the week, and Maddux said the 29-year-old looked \"really good\" and now has to build up his stamina.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nGiants: To make room on the roster for Melancon, the INF Miguel Gomez went on the 10-day DL, retroactive to Aug. 9, with right knee inflammation.\n\nNationals: Strasburg is one of 11 Nationals players currently on the DL, and Baker doesn't want to rush anyone back. Baker said outfielder Taylor doesn't have his timing yet and reliever Shawn Kelley (back) isn't as sharp as trainers would like yet. ...

Join for free]\n\nStar slugger Bryce Harper slipped while trying to beat out an infield hit in the first inning Saturday night, and he immediately collapsed in pain holding his lower left leg.\n\nNationals manager Dusty Baker did not have much additional information following the game, announcing only that Harper hyperextended his left knee and would undergo an MRI on Sunday.\n\n\"We just ask for prayers that it's not serious,\" Baker told the media.\n\nThe Nationals and the Giants were rained out Friday night, and more inclement weather delayed the start of Saturday's game by about three hours. Rain continued to come down in the nation's capital, but MLB decided to go ahead with the game. Harper skidded across the bag and landed awkwardly on his left foot. When his right foot landed, Harper flipped up into the air, landing with a thud.\n\nHarper stayed down for several minutes, writhing in pain as the training staff and coaches attended to their superstar player. Eventually he was propped up and carried off on the shoulders of two assistants. He did not put any weight on the leg.\n\nThe injury, if serious, would be a massive blow to a Nationals team that very much looks the part of a championship contender. They were 68-45 entering Saturday's game with a 14-game lead in the NL East. They own the third-best record in the majors behind the Dodgers and the Astros.\n\nHarper is hitting .327 with 29 home runs and 87 runs batted in this year and is a strong candidate for his second NL MVP award.\n\nIt's been a trying year for the team on the injury front. Earlier in the year, starting centerfielder Adam Eaton tore his ACL on a very similar play to Harper's. Currently, starting left fielder Jayson Werth, starting shortstop Trea Turner and star pitcher Stephen Strasburg are all on the DL as well. Another starter, Joe Ross, is out for the year after recently undergoing Tommy John surgery.\n\nMore MLB coverage from Yahoo Sports:", "timeCrawl": "06:12:00", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8878313", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "id": 134, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "id": 135, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "id": 137, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "id": 205, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "id": 206, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "id": 641, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Abstract", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Abstract", "id": 751, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

When it actually rained Friday night at Nationals Park, they somehow screwed the process up again.\n\nAfter three hours of steady drizzle, the Nationals finally announced to the remaining fans that the game had been postponed. By that point, the Giants clubhouse had long since cleared out as players headed back to the hotel or for an unexpected dinner. The Giants found out the game wouldn't be played because someone in the press box texted manager Bruce Bochy and told him the Nationals' TV announcers had already left. They will play a split doubleheader on Sunday, with the first game starting at 1:05 p.m. and the second game beginning at 7:05 p.m.\n\nThe official postponement came at 9:48 p.m. The tarp went on at 6:38 p.m. Maybe one day they'll figure out how to handle things here? Anyway, here are some notes from when it was dry ...\n\n--- There is a chance Mark Melancon comes off the disabled list on Saturday, Bochy said. Melancon has been sidelined since June 28 by a pronator strain but he felt good in his last rehab outing. He will be eased back into the bullpen mix, with Sam Dyson remaining the closer for at least a few more games.\n\n--- Johnny Cueto played a very light game of catch. It was his first time picking up a ball since he came out of a rehab start with elbow discomfort, and he said everything felt fine. Still, this was just a very small step. Cueto will remain with the Giants on this trip and they'll see how he feels.\n\n--- Bochy does not expect any issues between Hunter Strickland and Bryce Harper, and he said he wouldn't hesitate to use Strickland if Harper's spot is coming up. We'll see. The Giants are still feeling the aftershocks of that fight, specifically with their former left fielder/first baseman. Michael Morse will meet with the staff in Miami on Tuesday, but he's not expected to return to the team this season. Morse hasn't played since suffering a concussion during that fight, and given where the team is in the standings (and the number of young players seeing time) it never made sense for Morse to ramp up what would have been a long rehab process.\n\n--- Miguel Gomez got treatment for knee inflammation and he was cleared to play. \"I asked him if he could outrun me,\" Bochy said. \"He said yes.\"", "timeCrawl": "08:57:00", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1118, "date": "2017-06-28", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1125}], "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8892926", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "id": 134, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "id": 135, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "id": 137, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "id": 205, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Abstract", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Abstract", "id": 751, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

"score": 2}], "time": "05:25:00", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "Washington -- When Bryce Harper clutched at his left knee after slipping on first base, the stadium went silent and Dusty Baker feared the worst.\n\nLess than a year after watching catcher Wilson Ramos tear the ACL in his right knee on a noncontact play after a rain delay, Baker just hoped it wasn't that bad. But the uncertainty over Harper's injury overshadowed the Washington Nationals' 3-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Saturday night.\n\nBaker said Harper hyperextended the knee and was scheduled to have an MRI.\n\n\"The same reaction everybody had -- silence goes over the crowd,\" Baker said. \"You're just thinking, 'Please, Lord, don't let it be serious.'\"\n\nBaker went so far as to ask for prayers from baseball fans for the health of one of the sport's top players and a potential NL MVP candidate. Harper, the 2015 MVP who is hitting .326 with 29 home runs and 87 RBIs as the most fearsome hitter in the league this season, was not made available to speak to reporters after the game but could be seen walking with a limp.\n\nThe injury came as it was raining about 20 minutes into the game after a three-hour delay. Harper tried to run out a grounder to the right side and though he avoided colliding with first baseman Ryder Jones or Giants pitcher Jeff Samardzija, he slipped on first base, which was still wet.\n\n\"It didn't look good,\" Jones said. \"I hope he's all right. It's just one of those freak plays where you kind of thought there would be a collision and there wasn't and that might be part of it, too.\"\n\nThe result of the game meant little for Washington, which leads the NL East by 14 \u00bd games, or San Francisco, which is out of contention. Baker said the teams were \"at the mercy of the schedule\" with Major League Baseball in control and the Giants in town for the last time this season.\n\nWith Harper out, the Nationals got their offense in the form of RBI doubles from Ryan Zimmerman and Adam Lind, and an RBI single from Daniel Murphy off Samardzjia (7-12).\n\nRight-hander Edwin Jackson (3-2) allowed one earned run on five hits and struck out five in six innings before giving way to Washington's newfound lockdown bullpen trio of Brandon Kintzler, Ryan Madson and Sean Doolittle.\n\nMELANCON BACK\n\nGiants manager Bruce Bochy wanted to make sure Mark Melancon's first appearance off the disabled list didn't come in a high-leverage situation after the $62 million closer missed more than six weeks with a right forearm strain. He was able to do that, as Melancon allowed one hit and had one strikeout against his most recent team in the eighth inning, his first work since June 27.\n\n\"I thought it was a perfect situation, eighth inning there down two,\" Bochy said. \"We're in the ballgame, so he's got some adrenaline going, pitching late in the ballgame. And he did a good job.\"\n\nSTRASBURG REHAB\n\nNationals right-hander Stephen Strasburg will make a minor league rehab start Monday at Class A Potomac.\n\nStrasburg has been on the disabled list since late July with a right elbow nerve impingement. Pitching coach Mike Maddux said that Strasburg is likely to throw about five innings and 75 pitches in his first rehab outing.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nGiants: To make room on the roster for Melancon, the INF Miguel Gomez went on the 10-day DL, retroactive to Aug. 9, with right knee inflammation.\n\nNationals: Strasburg is one of 11 Nationals players currently on the DL, and Baker doesn't want to rush anyone back. Baker said outfielder Taylor doesn't have his timing yet and reliever Shawn Kelley (back) isn't as sharp as trainers would like yet. ...

General manager Mike Rizzo told reporters that Harper only sustained a \"significant bone bruise\" and that Harper's knee ligaments and tendons were undamaged following an MRI on Sunday morning. Rizzo said the hope was that Harper will be back this season.\n\nThis has to be considered outstanding news for the Nationals and Harper. It's difficult to remember a situation where a player's leg buckled like Harper's and the player didn't have a torn a ACL as a result. Have a look at the play where he suffered the \"significant\" bone bruise:\n\nSuch an injury would've ended Harper's season and impacted his 2018 campaign. Instead, it sounds like he has a shot to return late this season or maybe just for the playoffs. The Nationals have a big enough lead in the NL East to be overly cautious with him, too.\n\nHarper, 24, is hitting .326/.419/.614 with 27 doubles, 29 homers, 87 RBI and 92 runs this season. He's on the short list of top-notch MVP candidates, so losing him for any length of time greatly impacts the Nationals. They do, however, have a 14 1/2 game lead in the NL East and are definitely postseason bound.\n\nThe Nationals have already lost Adam Eaton and Trea Turner to serious injury. Jayson Werth is out with a foot contusion and Michael Taylor has an oblique injury. Thus, it appears they are down to Adam Lind and Howie Kendrick flanking Brian Goodwin in the outfield for the time being.\n\nBig picture, though, to reiterate: This is great news for the Nationals and Harper.

But the uncertainty over Harper's injury overshadowed the Washington Nationals' 3-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Saturday night.\n\nBaker said Harper hyperextended the knee and was scheduled to have an MRI.\n\n\"The same reaction everybody had -- silence goes over the crowd,\" Baker said. \"You're just thinking, 'Please, Lord, don't let it be serious.'\"\n\nBaker went so far as to ask for prayers from baseball fans for the health of one of the sport's top players and a potential NL MVP candidate. Harper, the 2015 MVP who is hitting .326 with 29 home runs and 87 RBIs as the most fearsome hitter in the league this season, was not made available to speak to reporters after the game but could be seen walking with a limp.\n\nThe injury came as it was raining about 20 minutes into the game after a three-hour delay. Harper tried to run out a grounder to the right side and though he avoided colliding with first baseman Ryder Jones or Giants pitcher Jeff Samardzija, he slipped on first base, which was still wet.\n\n\"It didn't look good,\" Jones said. \"I hope he's all right. It's just one of those freak plays where you kind of thought there would be a collision and there wasn't and that might be part of it, too.\"\n\nThe result of the game meant little for Washington, which leads the NL East by 14 \u00bd games, or San Francisco, which is out of contention. Baker said the teams were \"at the mercy of the schedule\" with Major League Baseball in control and the Giants in town for the last time this season.\n\nWith Harper out, the Nationals got their offense in the form of RBI doubles from Ryan Zimmerman and Adam Lind, and an RBI single from Daniel Murphy off Samardzjia (7-12).\n\nRight-hander Edwin Jackson (3-2) allowed one earned run on five hits and struck out five in six innings before giving way to Washington's newfound lockdown bullpen trio of Brandon Kintzler, Ryan Madson and Sean Doolittle.\n\nMELANCON BACK\n\nGiants manager Bruce Bochy wanted to make sure Mark Melancon's first appearance off the disabled list didn't come in a high-leverage situation after the $62 million closer missed more than six weeks with a right forearm strain. He was able to do that, as Melancon allowed one hit and had one strikeout against his most recent team in the eighth inning, his first work since June 27.\n\n\"I thought it was a perfect situation, eighth inning there down two,\" Bochy said. \"We're in the ballgame, so he's got some adrenaline going, pitching late in the ballgame. And he did a good job.\"\n\nSTRASBURG REHAB\n\nNationals right-hander Stephen Strasburg will make a minor league rehab start Monday at Class A Potomac.\n\nStrasburg has been on the disabled list since late July with a right elbow nerve impingement. Pitching coach Mike Maddux said that Strasburg is likely to throw about five innings and 75 pitches in his first rehab outing.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nGiants: To make room on the roster for Melancon, the INF Miguel Gomez went on the 10-day DL, retroactive to Aug. 9, with right knee inflammation.\n\nNationals: Strasburg is one of 11 Nationals players currently on the DL, and Baker doesn't want to rush anyone back. Baker said outfielder Taylor doesn't have his timing yet and reliever Shawn Kelley (back) isn't as sharp as trainers would like yet. ... Enny Romero (forearm strain) is playing catch, and Baker said he's hopeful the lefty is back soon.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRHP A.J Cole (1-2, 5.63 ERA) starts the day game of a split-doubleheader for the Nationals against Giants RHP Chris Stratton (0-2, 6.63).

"CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Bryce Harper sustained what appeared to be a serious left knee injury when he slipped on a wet first base and his left leg buckled while running out a grounder early in the Washington Nationals' 3-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Saturday night.\n\nHarper clutched at his knee while on the wet field and put no weight on his left leg as he was helped off. The 2015 NL MVP left the game immediately, and manager Dusty Baker said Harper hyperextended his knee.\n\n\"He was in obvious pain and he was praying and I was praying, too,\" said manager Dusty Baker, adding that Harper would have an MRI.\n\n\"I'm asking for prayers that it's not serious,\" Baker said.\n\nThe result of the game meant little for Washington, which leads the NL East by 14 \u00bd games, or San Francisco, which is out of contention. It didn't begin until 10:06 p.m. after another extended weather delay, and it was raining when Harper lost his footing on a base that had water on it.\n\nThe Nationals lost catcher Wilson Ramos to a torn ACL in his right knee in late September last season, another noncontact injury that came after a rain delay in Washington.\n\nIf Harper is out, it's a more devastating injury to the Nationals' World Series hopes than when Ramos' season ended prematurely a year ago. Harper is hitting .326 with 29 home runs and 87 RBIs as the most fearsome hitter in the league.\n\nWith Harper out, the Nationals got their offense in the form of RBI doubles from Ryan Zimmerman and Adam Lind, and an RBI single from Daniel Murphy off Giants starter Jeff Samardzjia (7-12).\n\nRight-hander Edwin Jackson (3-2) allowed one earned run on five hits and struck out five in six innings before giving way to Washington's newfound lockdown bullpen trio of Brandon Kintzler, Ryan Madson and Sean Doolittle.\n\nWHAT IF?\n\nWith the Nationals cruising toward another playoff appearance and Lind and Brian Goodwin playing well, manager Dusty Baker was asked what he might do when Jayson Werth (bruised left foot) and Michael Taylor (strained right oblique) are healthy.\n\n\"I thought about it but not in-depth because there's so many things that can happen between now and then,\" Baker said, roughly seven hours before Harper went down. The Nationals have already used 12 outfielders this season.\n\nMELANCON BACK\n\nGiants manager Bruce Bochy wanted to make sure Mark Melancon's first appearance off the disabled list didn't come in a high-leverage situation after the $62 million closer missed more than six weeks with a right forearm strain. He was able to do that, as Melancon allowed one hit and had one strikeout against his most recent team in the eighth inning, his first work since June 27.\n\nSTRASBURG REHAB\n\nNationals right-hander Stephen Strasburg will make a minor league rehab start Monday at Class A Potomac.\n\nStrasburg has been on the disabled list since late July with a right elbow nerve impingement. Pitching coach Mike Maddux said that Strasburg is likely to throw about five innings and 75 pitches in his first rehab outing.\n\nStrasburg took part in a simulated game earlier in the week, and Maddux said the 29-year-old looked \"really good\" and now has to build up his stamina.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nGiants: To make room on the roster for Melancon, the INF Miguel Gomez went on the 10-day DL, retroactive to Aug. 9, with right knee inflammation.\n\nNationals: Strasburg is one of 11 Nationals players currently on the DL, and Baker doesn't want to rush anyone back. Baker said outfielder Taylor doesn't have his timing yet and reliever Shawn Kelley (back) isn't as sharp as trainers would like yet. ... Enny Romero (forearm strain) is playing catch, and Baker said he's hopeful the lefty is back soon.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRHP A.J Cole (1-2, 5.63 ERA) starts the day game of a split-doubleheader for the Nationals against Giants RHP Chris Stratton (0-2, 6.63). Reigning NL Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer (12-5, 2.23) had his choice which game to pitch and preferred night, and he'll face San Francisco LHP Matt Moore (3-12, 5.88).\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

feared the worst.\n\nLess than a year after watching catcher Wilson Ramos tear the ACL in his right knee on a noncontact play after a rain delay, Baker just hoped it wasn't that bad. But the uncertainty over Harper's injury overshadowed the Washington Nationals' 3-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Saturday night.\n\nBaker said Harper hyperextended the knee and was scheduled to have an MRI.\n\n\"The same reaction everybody had -- silence goes over the crowd,\" Baker said. \"You're just thinking, 'Please, Lord, don't let it be serious.'\"\n\nBaker went so far as to ask for prayers from baseball fans for the health of one of the sport's top players and a potential NL MVP candidate. Harper, the 2015 MVP who is hitting .326 with 29 home runs and 87 RBIs as the most fearsome hitter in the league this season, was not made available to speak to reporters after the game but could be seen walking with a limp.\n\nThe injury came as it was raining about 20 minutes into the game after a three-hour delay. Harper tried to run out a grounder to the right side and though he avoided colliding with first baseman Ryder Jones or Giants pitcher Jeff Samardzija, he slipped on first base, which was still wet.\n\n\"It didn't look good,\" Jones said. \"I hope he's all right. It's just one of those freak plays where you kind of thought there would be a collision and there wasn't and that might be part of it, too.\"\n\nThe result of the game meant little for Washington, which leads the NL East by 14 \u00bd games, or San Francisco, which is out of contention. Baker said the teams were \"at the mercy of the schedule\" with Major League Baseball in control and the Giants in town for the last time this season.\n\nWith Harper out, the Nationals got their offense in the form of RBI doubles from Ryan Zimmerman and Adam Lind, and an RBI single from Daniel Murphy off Samardzjia (7-12).\n\nRight-hander Edwin Jackson (3-2) allowed one earned run on five hits and struck out five in six innings before giving way to Washington's newfound lockdown bullpen trio of Brandon Kintzler, Ryan Madson and Sean Doolittle.\n\nMELANCON BACK\n\nGiants manager Bruce Bochy wanted to make sure Mark Melancon's first appearance off the disabled list didn't come in a high-leverage situation after the $62 million closer missed more than six weeks with a right forearm strain.

Enny Romero (forearm strain) is playing catch, and Baker said he's hopeful the lefty is back soon.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRHP A.J Cole (1-2, 5.63 ERA) starts the day game of a split-doubleheader for the Nationals against Giants RHP Chris Stratton (0-2, 6.63). Reigning NL Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer (12-5, 2.23) had his choice which game to pitch and preferred night, and he'll face San Francisco LHP Matt Moore (3-12, 5.88).\n\n-- -- --\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball", "timeCrawl": "08:57:00", "sim": 0.6431372761726379, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2607, "date": "2017-06-27", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2614}, {"textStart": 3283, "date": "2017-08-09", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3289}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8892935", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "id": 36, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "id": 223, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "id": 224, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "id": 381, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

During the first inning of last nights game, which had been delayed for three hours due to rain, Harper was running out a ground ball at first base when his foot slipped off the base and planted into the ground, twisting his leg violently and sending him flying through the air.\n\nAs he rolled around on the ground in agony, Nationals trainers and manager Dusty Baker rushed onto the field to help the youngster out, baker with his hands on his head. After being helped off the field without putting any weight on the leg, the panic set in among fans and the organization that the injury would be substantial. Here is the play:\n\nWe dodged a bullet here,\" said Rizzo, adding that it was \"pretty remarkable\" that Harper avoided a more significant injury.\n\n\"The bone bruise is something of significance, and we're going to treat him cautiously and hopefully have him back later on this season,\" Rizzo said. \"We put ourselves in a position that we can treat it cautiously, and we'll continue down that road.\"\n\nCertainly that is great news for everyone. Harper has been placed on the 10- day disabled list, although there is no timetable for his return. Outfielder Michael Taylor, who himself has been out of action since early July with his own leg injury, has been called up to take his roster spot.\n\nThe Nationals dodged a big bullet here, as they have legitimate World Series hopes for this year. That all goes out the window without Harper, who was having an MVP-type season before sliding off that base, hitting .326 with 29 home runs and 87 RBIs. They go as he goes, and while there is no way he is back soon, they should have him for the stretch run and playoffs. Thankfully for them, as of today they are running away with the NL East, owning a 14.5 game lead in the division. That will afford Harper as much time as he needs.", "timeCrawl": "16:44:00", "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8941903", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "id": 319, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models", "id": 461, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "id": 811, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Morse sustained a concussion and bruised ribs following a collision with Jeff Samardzija during the infamous Hunter Strickland/Bryce Harper brawl back in May, and it appears that he has not yet made a full recovery. He's expected to join the team on their road trip in Miami next week, but his chances of making a full comeback -- in this season or any other -- seem slim to none at this point.\n\nPrior to the Memorial Day melee, Morse slashed an underwhelming .194/.250/.306 with one home run in 40 PA with San Francisco. Even before he inadvertently used his head to block Samardzija from sucker punching Harper, it looked like 2017 would be the final encore to a 13-year Major League career, one that had petered out after the 35-year-old took a six-game gig with the 2016 Pirates.\n\nHe was officially placed on the 10-day disabled list on June 8 but, as of August 11, has yet to take any kind of rehab assignment with the team. According to the Mercury News' Andrew Baggarly, manager Bruce Bochy told reporters that he does not intend to reinstate Morse on the active roster come September, a decision that will likely bring Morse's career to its unfortunate and unusual end. The rest of the Giants, meanwhile, are scheduled to take on the Nationals in their first meeting since that holiday weekend, and will kick off a three-game set in Washington on Friday at 7:05 ET.\n\nFollow @wcoastfangirl", "timeCrawl": "08:57:00", "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "extractedDates": [{"date": "-06-08", "textStart": 977, "amb": false, "textEnd": 983}, {"textStart": 995, "date": "2017-08-11", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1004}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8892940", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports", "id": 14, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "id": 32, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "id": 381, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "id": 435, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "id": 947, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The 35-year-old will travel to Miami on Tuesday during the Giants' series with the Marlins to be evaluated.\n\nAt the time of his injury, Morse was struggling, posting a .194/.250/.306 slash line with 14 strikeouts and three walks in 24 games. Morse has hit .274 over his 13-year career, but he hasn't remained healthy the past two seasons.\n\nIt's uncertain how productive Morse would've been if he returned, but he could've tried to help San Francisco's offense, which has scored the third-fewest runs in baseball. The Giants likely want to be cautious with him, as they entered Friday 36 games back of the Dodgers in the National League West.\n\nMorse primarily served as a pinch-hitter, but he also played first base, which could've been beneficial with Brandon Belt on the DL (concussion).\n\nMark Melancon update\n\nMelancon will likely be activated Saturday after landing on the DL with a right elbow injury June 28.\n\nMelancon's status depends on how he feels after playing catch Friday. Bochy said he'll likely avoid using Melancon in a high-leverage situation during his first appearance back, but he wouldn't rule out using the right-hander late in the game.\n\n\"He feels like he's pitchable,\" Bochy said. \"We feel like he can contribute in our bullpen. He can help out, and that's what he wants to do.\"\n\nIn 22 appearances this year, Melancon has notched a 4.35 ERA while going 11-for-15 in save opportunities. The 32-year-old recorded an ERA below 2.30 in each of his four seasons before entering this campaign, including three with an ERA under 2.00. He'll have a chance this weekend to face the Nationals, whom he played with during the second half of last season.\n\nMelancon looked good in two of his Minor League outings with Class A Advanced San Jose, but the other didn't go as well, when he allowed four earned runs over two-thirds of an inning.\n\nWorth noting\n\n* Johnny Cueto played catch on the field Friday afternoon before the Giants' game vs. the Nationals, as he's rehabbing the right mild flexor strain he endured Aug. 1.\n\n* Bochy said Miguel Gomez is \"doing a lot better\" from the right knee injury he sustained Tuesday, telling the manager he could outrun him.", "timeCrawl": "23:54:00", "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1047, "date": "2017-06-28", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1054}, {"textStart": 2167, "date": "2017-08-01", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2173}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8721217", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "id": 284, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Abstract", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Abstract", "id": 751, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

As you can see, he went down in a heap.\n\nThe Nationals currently hold a 14-game lead in the National League East, and it doesn't seem that there will a be historic collapse for the team. That being said, an injury to arguably the best player in baseball is never good news, not matter how many games you're up in the division race.\n\nTrea Turner is currently on the DL while recovering from a fractured wrist with no clear timetable for his return. Jayson Werth is still on the DL as well with his foot injury, but he is reportedly about a week or two away from a rehab assignment. Stephen Strasburg is currently set to make a rehab start on Monday after missing the last couple weeks due to an elbow injury.\n\nThe Nationals can survive those injuries, but if Harper goes down for the year we're not sure they can survive that.

Jones and Jeff Samardzija avoided injury. Bryce Harper, however, wasn't as lucky.\n\nHarper, the superstar right fielder here in Washington D.C., crumpled after slipping on first base in the first inning Saturday night. The injury stunned a crowd that waited three hours for the rain-delayed game, which the Nationals won 3-1.\n\nHarper was diagnosed with a hyperextended left knee. He will have an MRI on Sunday to determine if there are further injuries.\n\n\"It didn't look good. I hope he's alright,\" Jones said. \"It was one of those freak plays where you think there's going to be a collision but there wasn't. The tops of the bases were wet from the rain. I stepped on the base and jumped out of the way. I didn't really notice anything when I tagged the base and then I heard all the fans go 'ohhhh.'\n\n\"He looked like he was in pretty good pain. You never want that to happen to a player.\"\n\nHarper was hurt about 20 minutes after the first pitch, which came three hours later than planned because of a storm that hit Nationals Park in the evening. It was unclear why Major League Baseball did not push Friday's postponed game to Saturday afternoon, when the skies were clear. The teams ended up going through their routines for a 7:05 start, but as Samardzija headed to the dugout to start warming up, the Giants were told they would be delayed.\n\nThey scrambled to get a new start time at a park where just about every rain-related decision this season has backfired. At 7:57 p.m., the rain finally arrived in sheets. The teams did not take the field until 10:06 p.m., and neither manager altered his lineup despite a steady drizzle that kept the field soaked from the start. Bruce Bochy checked the field and thought it looked fine.\n\nThe Giants took an early lead on a Joe Panik homer, but the Nationals struck right back, threatening with Wilmer Difo's one-out double in the bottom of the first. Harper pulled a hard grounder that looked like an RBI double before it found Jones' outstretched glove. Jones got up and raced Harper and Samardzija to the bag, in what was an odd coincidence. It was Samardzija who was racing into a scrum earlier this season to get to Harper, but Michael Morse got in the way and saw his season end instead.\n\nAs Jones stepped on first, he deftly moved to his right to get out of Harper's way. Harper slipped on the top of the bag and skidded forward, his knee twisting grotesquely. After a couple of minutes on the ground, he was helped off the field with his legs hanging in the air.\n\n\"I saw a guy hustling to try to get a hit,\" Samardzija said. \"You wait around three hours and you come out and everyone wants to play. It was tough conditions. It's tough to see, especially with a kid who plays so hard and cares so much. Hopefully it's not as bad as they think and he comes back sooner rather than later.\"", "timeCrawl": "13:49:00", "sim": 0.6235294342041016, "extractedDates": null, "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8922571", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "id": 36, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "id": 114, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Fields", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Fields", "id": 624, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

right knee on a noncontact play after a rain delay, Baker just hoped it wasn't that bad. But the uncertainty over Harper's injury overshadowed the Washington Nationals' 3-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Saturday night.\n\nBaker said Harper hyperextended the knee and was scheduled to have an MRI.\n\n\"The same reaction everybody had - silence goes over the crowd,\" Baker said. \"You're just thinking, 'Please, Lord, don't let it be serious.'\"\n\nBaker went so far as to ask for prayers from baseball fans for the health of one of the sport's top players and a potential NL MVP candidate. Harper, the 2015 MVP who is hitting .326 with 29 home runs and 87 RBIs as the most fearsome hitter in the league this season, was not made available to speak to reporters after the game but could be seen walking with a limp.\n\nThe injury came as it was raining about 20 minutes into the game after a three-hour delay. Harper tried to run out a grounder to the right side and though he avoided colliding with first baseman Ryder Jones or Giants pitcher Jeff Samardzija, he slipped on first base, which was still wet.\n\n\"It didn't look good,\" Jones said. \"I hope he's all right. It's just one of those freak plays where you kind of thought there would be a collision and there wasn't and that might be part of it, too.\"\n\nThe result of the game meant little for Washington, which leads the NL East by 14 \u00bd games, or San Francisco, which is out of contention. Baker said the teams were \"at the mercy of the schedule\" with Major League Baseball in control and the Giants in town for the last time this season.\n\nWith Harper out, the Nationals got their offense in the form of RBI doubles from Ryan Zimmerman and Adam Lind, and an RBI single from Daniel Murphy off Samardzjia (7-12).\n\nRight-hander Edwin Jackson (3-2) allowed one earned run on five hits and struck out five in six innings before giving way to Washington's newfound lockdown bullpen trio of Brandon Kintzler, Ryan Madson and Sean Doolittle.\n\nMELANCON BACK\n\nGiants manager Bruce Bochy wanted to make sure Mark Melancon's first appearance off the disabled list didn't come in a high-leverage situation after the $62 million closer missed more than six weeks with a right forearm strain. He was able to do that, as Melancon allowed one hit and had one strikeout against his most recent team in the eighth inning, his first work since June 27.\n\n\"I thought it was a perfect situation, eighth inning there down two,\" Bochy said. \"We're in the ballgame, so he's got some adrenaline going, pitching late in the ballgame. And he did a good job.\"\n\nSTRASBURG REHAB\n\nNationals right-hander Stephen Strasburg will make a minor league rehab start Monday at Class A Potomac.\n\nStrasburg has been on the disabled list since late July with a right elbow nerve impingement. Pitching coach Mike Maddux said that Strasburg is likely to throw about five innings and 75 pitches in his first rehab outing.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nGiants: To make room on the roster for Melancon, the INF Miguel Gomez went on the 10-day DL, retroactive to Aug. 9, with right knee inflammation.\n\nNationals: Strasburg is one of 11 Nationals players currently on the DL, and Baker doesn't want to rush anyone back. Baker said outfielder Taylor doesn't have his timing yet and reliever Shawn Kelley (back) isn't as sharp as trainers would like yet. ... Enny Romero (forearm strain) is playing catch, and Baker said he's hopeful the lefty is back soon.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRHP A.J Cole (1-2, 5.63 ERA) starts the day game of a split-doubleheader for the Nationals against Giants RHP Chris Stratton (0-2, 6.63). Reigning NL Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer (12-5, 2.23) had his choice which game to pitch and preferred night, and he'll face San Francisco LHP Matt Moore (3-12, 5.88).\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball", "timeCrawl": "07:36:00", "sim": 0.615686297416687, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2454, "date": "2017-06-27", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2461}, {"textStart": 3130, "date": "2017-08-09", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3136}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8885545", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "id": 36, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "id": 223, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "id": 224, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "id": 381, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The home team lost much more than that on this night.\n\nNationals superstar right fielder Bryce Harper appeared to suffer a serious injury to his left knee in the first inning, putting another dark cloud over a long night. The Nationals scored two runs in that inning and that would be all they needed.\n\nA night after the teams were rained out, they waited three hours and one minute to get started because of an ugly storm that drenched the area. The crowd stayed engaged, but within minutes, a hush fell over Nationals Stadium. Harper slipped on first base while trying to beat out a grounder to Ryder Jones, and his knee went the wrong direction. He immediately grabbed at it as he rolled on the ground, and he was helped off the field without putting any pressure on his leg.\n\nThe Nationals did not have an update during the game. For now, here are five things to know from a wet night ...\n\n-- - Ryder Jones isn't hitting much, but he sure plays a nice first base. His diving stop robbed Andrew Stevenson of a single in the fifth. Jones also showed his athleticism a couple of ways on the Harper play, first by stopping the hard shot and then by twisting his body to avoid a collision with Harper at the bag.\n\n-- - The Giants are looking at 27 innings of baseball in about 24 hours, so every out from Jeff Samardzija was huge. He threw 120 pitches on a humid night while getting through six innings. He tied Matt Moore for the most pitches thrown by a Giants starter this season.\n\n-- - Mark Melancon pitched the eighth, making his first appearance since June 27. He gave up a single and struck out one. His fastball topped out at 93 mph. That's a good sign on the first night back.\n\n-- - Joe Panik opened the scoring with a long homer in the first. It was his seventh of the year. He has a chance to surpass his career-high of 10.\n\n-- - Denard Span is in a funk. He rolled out to second three times in four plate appearances, and he has just five hits in his last 41 at-bats.", "timeCrawl": "13:49:00", "sim": 0.615686297416687, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1638, "date": "2017-06-27", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1645}], "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8922567", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "id": 114, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "id": 223, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "id": 395, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Roleplaying", "id": 1189, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Jones and Jeff Samardzija avoided injury. Bryce Harper, however, wasn't as lucky.\n\nHarper, the superstar right fielder here in Washington D.C., crumpled after slipping on first base in the first inning Saturday night. The injury stunned a crowd that waited three hours for the rain-delayed game, which the Nationals won 3-1.\n\nHarper was diagnosed with a hyperextended left knee. He will have an MRI on Sunday to determine if there are further injuries.\n\n\"It didn't look good. I hope he's alright,\" Jones said. \"It was one of those freak plays where you think there's going to be a collision but there wasn't. The tops of the bases were wet from the rain. I stepped on the base and jumped out of the way. I didn't really notice anything when I tagged the base and then I heard all the fans go 'ohhhh.'\n\n\"He looked like he was in pretty good pain. You never want that to happen to a player.\"\n\nHarper was hurt about 20 minutes after the first pitch, which came three hours later than planned because of a storm that hit Nationals Park in the evening. It was unclear why Major League Baseball did not push Friday's postponed game to Saturday afternoon, when the skies were clear. The teams ended up going through their routines for a 7:05 start, but as Samardzija headed to the dugout to start warming up, the Giants were told they would be delayed.\n\nThey scrambled to get a new start time at a park where just about every rain-related decision this season has backfired. At 7:57 p.m., the rain finally arrived in sheets. The teams did not take the field until 10:06 p.m., and neither manager altered his lineup despite a steady drizzle that kept the field soaked from the start. Bruce Bochy checked the field and thought it looked fine.\n\nThe Giants took an early lead on a Joe Panik homer, but the Nationals struck right back, threatening with Wilmer Difo's one-out double in the bottom of the first. Harper pulled a hard grounder that looked like an RBI double before it found Jones' outstretched glove. Jones got up and raced Harper and Samardzija to the bag, in what was an odd coincidence. It was Samardzija who was racing into a scrum earlier this season to get to Harper, but Michael Morse got in the way and saw his season end instead.\n\nAs Jones stepped on first, he deftly moved to his right to get out of Harper's way. Harper slipped on the top of the bag and skidded forward, his knee twisting grotesquely. After a couple of minutes on the ground, he was helped off the field with his legs hanging in the air.\n\n\"I saw a guy hustling to try to get a hit,\" Samardzija said. \"You wait around three hours and you come out and everyone wants to play. It was tough conditions. It's tough to see, especially with a kid who plays so hard and cares so much. Hopefully it's not as bad as they think and he comes back sooner rather than later.\"", "timeCrawl": "08:57:00", "sim": 0.6078431606292725, "extractedDates": null, "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8892941", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical_Specialties", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical Specialties", "id": 3, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "id": 36, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "id": 114, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Fields", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Fields", "id": 624, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "id": 811, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

slipping on first base, the stadium went silent and Dusty Baker feared the worst.\n\nLess than a year after watching catcher Wilson Ramos tear the ACL in his right knee on a noncontact play after a rain delay, Baker just hoped it wasn't that bad. But the uncertainty over Harper's injury overshadowed the Washington Nationals' 3-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Saturday night.\n\nBaker said Harper hyperextended the knee and was scheduled to have an MRI.\n\n\"The same reaction everybody had - silence goes over the crowd,\" Baker said. \"You're just thinking, 'Please, Lord, don't let it be serious.'\"\n\nBaker went so far as to ask for prayers from baseball fans for the health of one of the sport's top players and a potential NL MVP candidate. Harper, the 2015 MVP who is hitting .326 with 29 home runs and 87 RBIs as the most fearsome hitter in the league this season, was not made available to speak to reporters after the game but could be seen walking with a limp.\n\nThe injury came as it was raining about 20 minutes into the game after a three-hour delay. Harper tried to run out a grounder to the right side and though he avoided colliding with first baseman Ryder Jones or Giants pitcher Jeff Samardzija, he slipped on first base, which was still wet.\n\n\"It didn't look good,\" Jones said. \"I hope he's all right. It's just one of those freak plays where you kind of thought there would be a collision and there wasn't and that might be part of it, too.\"\n\nThe result of the game meant little for Washington, which leads the NL East by 14 \u00bd games, or San Francisco, which is out of contention. Baker said the teams were \"at the mercy of the schedule\" with Major League Baseball in control and the Giants in town for the last time this season.\n\nWith Harper out, the Nationals got their offense in the form of RBI doubles from Ryan Zimmerman and Adam Lind, and an RBI single from Daniel Murphy off Samardzjia (7-12).\n\nRight-hander Edwin Jackson (3-2) allowed one earned run on five hits and struck out five in six innings before giving way to Washington's newfound lockdown bullpen trio of Brandon Kintzler, Ryan Madson and Sean Doolittle.\n\nMELANCON BACK\n\nGiants manager Bruce Bochy wanted to make sure Mark Melancon's first appearance off the disabled list didn't come in a high-leverage situation after the $62 million closer missed more than six weeks with a right forearm strain. He was able to do that, as Melancon allowed one hit and had one strikeout against his most recent team in the eighth inning, his first work since June 27.\n\n\"I thought it was a perfect situation, eighth inning there down two,\" Bochy said. \"We're in the ballgame, so he's got some adrenaline going, pitching late in the ballgame. And he did a good job.\"\n\nSTRASBURG REHAB\n\nNationals right-hander Stephen Strasburg will make a minor league rehab start Monday at Class A Potomac.\n\nStrasburg has been on the disabled list since late July with a right elbow nerve impingement. Pitching coach Mike Maddux said that Strasburg is likely to throw about five innings and 75 pitches in his first rehab outing.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nGiants: To make room on the roster for Melancon, the INF Miguel Gomez went on the 10-day DL, retroactive to Aug. 9, with right knee inflammation.\n\nNationals: Strasburg is one of 11 Nationals players currently on the DL, and Baker doesn't want to rush anyone back. Baker said outfielder Taylor doesn't have his timing yet and reliever Shawn Kelley (back) isn't as sharp as trainers would like yet. ... Enny Romero (forearm strain) is playing catch, and Baker said he's hopeful the lefty is back soon.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRHP A.J Cole (1-2, 5.63 ERA) starts the day game of a split-doubleheader for the Nationals against Giants RHP Chris Stratton (0-2, 6.63). Reigning NL Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer (12-5, 2.23) had his choice which game to pitch and preferred night, and he'll face San Francisco LHP Matt Moore (3-12, 5.88).\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

to injure his left knee when he slipped on a wet first base, a potentially devastating blow to the NL East-leading Washington Nationals.\n\nWhile running out a ground ball to the right side of the infield in the first inning Saturday night against the San Francisco Giants, Harper avoided contact with first baseman Ryder Jones and his left foot slipped on the base. His leg buckled, he went airborne and fell to the ground as his helmet went flying.\n\nHarper clutched at his left knee after going down and was attended to by trainers. Harper put no weight on his left leg as he was helped off the field.\n\nThe game began just after 10 p.m. local time following a 3-hour rain delay. It still was raining when Harper's injury happened in a game that ended at 1:17 a.m. Sunday. The Nationals won 3-1.\n\nMajor League Baseball was in control of weather decisions because it's the Giants' final trip to Washington this season. The series opener Friday was postponed after a lengthy rain delay and is set to be a part of a day-night doubleheader Sunday.\n\nHarper, the 2015 National League MVP, is hitting .327 with 29 home runs and 87 RBIs this season. He played in 105 of Washington's first 113 games.\n\nPirates lose another outfielder * The day after center fielder Andrew McCutchen exited early because of knee injury, right fielder Gregory Polanco pulled up lame Saturday after chasing a fly ball. Polanco re-injured his left hamstring, which already has landed him on the disabled list twice this season. McCutchen, meanwhile, reported his left knee felt \"fine\" Saturday and could return Sunday.\n\nRockies sign Howard * The Colorado Rockies agreed to a minor-league contract with first baseman Ryan Howard, a native St. Louisan who will report to Triple-A Albuquerque. Ryan, 37, hasn't played in the majors this season but could be a September call-up if he shows some power at the plate. He hit 382 home runs for the Phillies in 13 seasons, became a free agent and signed a minor league contract with Atlanta. He was released by the Braves after he hit .184 in 11 games at Triple-A.\n\nBrewers get Walker * The Milwaukee Brewers agreed to acquire veteran second baseman Neil Walker from the Mets. What the Brewers gave up for him was not immediately known. Jonathan Villar, counted upon to be the regular second baseman after a big 2016 season at shortstop, has been mired in a season-long offensive slump.

ligaments.\n\nBryce Harper landed in a heap behind the first base bag at Nationals Park Saturday night, adding himself to a laundry list of injured Nats. Harper crumbled inches from where Adam Eaton lay seconds after tearing his ACL in April. The bag that Harper slipped on was wet because of rain, similar to the conditions that led to Wilson Ramos' ACL tear in 2016. So, that's the fear: That Harper's return will be slated for a year from now, just months from his free agency, instead of weeks from now, just months from the 2017 playoffs.\n\nReports that Harper was walking without a significant limp or a brace does little to quell the fears that Baseball Twitter voiced after watching one of baseball's most exciting stars flung into the air by the catapult created by his own hyperextended knee. Harper won't undergo his MRI until Sunday morning, so, there's still time to worry about what the Nationals are calling a hyperextended knee. Dusty Baker, in his post-game press conference, asked for prayers from all baseball fans for a reason. Anyone with any vested interest in the sport of baseball will be worse off in a Harper-less MLB. Who will do the hairflips? Who will make Gumby-like defensive plays? Who will scream obscenities at umpires and blame it on listening to Chance the Rapper pregame?\n\nWhatever the answer to those questions, the plug the Nationals will use for the hole in the lineup and in right field requires more examination. The Nationals are currently without starters Eaton, Jayson Werth, Trea Turner, Stephen Strasburg, Joe Ross, and fringe starter Michael A. Taylor. Brian Goodwin, one of 12 men the Nats have used in the outfield in 2017, is the only healthy player on the Nats right field and center field depth charts. Harper missing any amount of time would mean a second potential MVP season to be would likely be replaced by Andrew Stevenson's first trip to the majors.\n\nA DL stint would freeze the MVP-caliber stats at .326/.419/.614 with 29 home runs. The offense in DC continued to be prolific when faced with injuries to other valuable lineup pieces. Brian Goodwin turned his offense around to be a contributor at the top of the lineup with a .808 OPS, and Wilmer Difo found his stride in July, earning a spot on the Player of the Month ballot. But Bryce is far more valuable than any player the Nationals have attempted to replace. The Angels were able to improve when they lost Mike Trout, but moving toward the mean for Angels hitters meant improving, for Nationals hitters, it would mean regressing. For now, the Nats just wait for MRI results, and if they want to listen to Baker, they pray.", "timeCrawl": "13:28:00", "sim": 0.5843137502670288, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8920237", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "id": 35, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "id": 36, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "id": 223, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "id": 381, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/College_and_University", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/College and University", "id": 382, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

"score": 2}], "time": "06:33:00", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Bryce Harper clutched at his left knee after slipping on first base, the stadium went silent and Dusty Baker feared the worst.\n\nLess than a year after watching catcher Wilson Ramos tear the ACL in his right knee on a noncontact play after a rain delay, Baker just hoped it wasn't that bad. But the uncertainty over Harper's injury overshadowed the Washington Nationals' 3-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Saturday night.\n\nBaker said Harper hyperextended the knee and was scheduled to have an MRI.\n\n\"The same reaction everybody had - silence goes over the crowd,\" Baker said. \"You're just thinking, 'Please, Lord, don't let it be serious.'\"\n\nBaker went so far as to ask for prayers from baseball fans for the health of one of the sport's top players and a potential NL MVP candidate. Harper, the 2015 MVP who is hitting .326 with 29 home runs and 87 RBIs as the most fearsome hitter in the league this season, was not made available to speak to reporters after the game but could be seen walking with a limp.\n\nThe injury came as it was raining about 20 minutes into the game after a three-hour delay. Harper tried to run out a grounder to the right side and though he avoided colliding with first baseman Ryder Jones or Giants pitcher Jeff Samardzija, he slipped on first base, which was still wet.\n\n\"It didn't look good,\" Jones said. \"I hope he's all right. It's just one of those freak plays where you kind of thought there would be a collision and there wasn't and that might be part of it, too.\"\n\nThe result of the game meant little for Washington, which leads the NL East by 14 \" games, or San Francisco, which is out of contention. Baker said the teams were \"at the mercy of the schedule\" with Major League Baseball in control and the Giants in town for the last time this season.\n\nWith Harper out, the Nationals got their offense in the form of RBI doubles from Ryan Zimmerman and Adam Lind, and an RBI single from Daniel Murphy off Samardzjia (7-12).\n\nRight-hander Edwin Jackson (3-2) allowed one earned run on five hits and struck out five in six innings before giving way to Washington's newfound lockdown bullpen trio of Brandon Kintzler, Ryan Madson and Sean Doolittle.\n\nMELANCON BACK\n\nGiants manager Bruce Bochy wanted to make sure Mark Melancon's first appearance off the disabled list didn't come in a high-leverage situation after the $62 million closer missed more than six weeks with a right forearm strain. He was able to do that, as Melancon allowed one hit and had one strikeout against his most recent team in the eighth inning, his first work since June 27.\n\n\"I thought it was a perfect situation, eighth inning there down two,\" Bochy said. \"We're in the ballgame, so he's got some adrenaline going, pitching late in the ballgame. And he did a good job.\"\n\nStrasburg has been on the disabled list since late July with a right elbow nerve impingement. Pitching coach Mike Maddux said that Strasburg is likely to throw about five innings and 75 pitches in his first rehab outing.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nGiants: To make room on the roster for Melancon, the INF Miguel Gomez went on the 10-day DL, retroactive to Aug. 9, with right knee inflammation.\n\nNationals: Strasburg is one of 11 Nationals players currently on the DL, and Baker doesn't want to rush anyone back. Baker said outfielder Taylor doesn't have his timing yet and reliever Shawn Kelley (back) isn't as sharp as trainers would like yet. ... Enny Romero (forearm strain) is playing catch, and Baker said he's hopeful the lefty is back soon.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRHP A.J Cole (1-2, 5.63 ERA) starts the day game of a split-doubleheader for the Nationals against Giants RHP Chris Stratton (0-2, 6.63). Reigning NL Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer (12-5, 2.23) had his choice which game to pitch and preferred night, and he'll face San Francisco LHP Matt Moore (3-12, 5.88).", "timeCrawl": "06:40:00", "sim": 0.5843137502670288, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2605, "date": "2017-06-27", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2612}, {"textStart": 3158, "date": "2017-08-09", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3164}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8880548", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "id": 36, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "id": 137, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Abstract", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Abstract", "id": 751, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Multiplayer", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Multiplayer", "id": 1009, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

This time, the rains were falling at Nationals Park leading up to their scheduled game against the San Francisco Giants. That forced the Nationals to delay the start indefinitely.\n\n[Now's the time to sign up for Fantasy Football! Join for free]\n\nWith a less than encouraging forecast, the Nationals would ultimately decide to postpone Friday's game. It was definitely the right call as the rains continued falling throughout the night. The problem was, the Nationals did not bother making the announcement to their opponents or their fans until well after that decision had been reached.\n\nHere's how the story played out through tweets from Giants beat writers Andrew Baggarly, Alex Pavlovic and John Shea, along with Nationals beat writer Mark Zuckerman.\n\nThey're putting the tarp on the field at Nationals Park.\n\n-- Alex Pavlovic (@PavlovicNBCS) August 11, 2017\n\nRain update: It is still raining. Occasionally, there is lightning. I'm not sure what we're doing here.\n\n-- Alex Pavlovic (@PavlovicNBCS) August 12, 2017\n\nPeople are packing stuff up. Looks like there won't be baseball here in the District of Columbia tonight. Not confirmed yet.\n\n-- Andrew Baggarly (@extrabaggs) August 12, 2017\n\nNo word yet on a postponement or reschedule date, or whether the game can be rescheduled as a Harper-Strickland steel cage match.\n\n-- Andrew Baggarly (@extrabaggs) August 12, 2017\n\nDenard Span just walked past me in street clothes. Yeah. No game tonight.\n\n-- Andrew Baggarly (@extrabaggs) August 12, 2017\n\nNationals haven't announced the rainout, and all the Giants' players are gone. Goofy.\n\n-- John Shea (@JohnSheaHey) August 12, 2017\n\nGiants found out they wouldn't be playing because someone in press box told them Nationals TV announcers left. Great work, Nationals.\n\n-- Alex Pavlovic (@PavlovicNBCS) August 12, 2017\n\nYou read that correctly. The Giants didn't learn of the postponement directly from the Nationals, but rather from a message passed down from the press box.\n\nThat is a rather stunning lack of communication, but even more startling is that many fans continued waiting around even beyond this point as the Nationals had yet to make an official announcement publicly.\n\nStill no announcement on the scoreboard. There are plenty of fans still standing around who don't know it's been postponed.\n\n-- Mark Zuckerman (@MarkZuckerman) August 12, 2017\n\nThe postponement has been announced on the scoreboard. What fans remain are booing.\n\n-- Mark Zuckerman (@MarkZuckerman) August 12, 2017\n\nThat's both mind-boggling and inexcusable.\n\nReporters speculated the decision was delayed while club officials debated whether to reschedule a doubleheader for Saturday or Sunday. The Nationals opted for a split doubleheader on Sunday with the forecast for Saturday not looking all that promising either.\n\nRegardless, there's a responsibility to get that information out as soon as possible, particularly when there are fans already in the ballpark. Those fans only concern as they waited was whether or not there would be baseball, and aside from maybe squeezing out a few more concession sales there doesn't seem to be a good reason to keep them waiting.\n\nWe don't envy teams or the league when it comes to making weather decisions and sorting out the scheduling conflicts they often create. Mother Nature is often unpredictable, which can complicate those matters. But there's really no excuse for not providing updates and simply communicating with your paying customers.\n\nHere's hoping the Nationals have learned another lesson and will be better prepared to handle all angles of their next weather drama.\n\nMore MLB coverage from Yahoo Sports:\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nMark Townsend is a writer for Big League Stew on Yahoo Sports.

He also had six strikeouts and one walk while throwing a season-high 120 pitches (79 strikes). Despite battling inconsistency for much of the season, Samardzija's latest outing was his fourth straight quality start.\n\n\"A great job, I thought, by Shark,\" said manager Bruce Bochy. \"He really competed well. He threw a lot of pitches but he can handle it. It was a quality start. Early on, we just missed out on some opportunities and that came back to get us. In the second, we had first and second and none out and we couldn't move them. But he pitched well. The pitching was there.\"\n\nWith a doubleheader scheduled for Sunday, the Giants were hoping Samardzija would save the bullpen from a heavy workload Saturday.\n\n\"[Sunday] will be a tough day for us,\" said Samardzija, who dropped to 7-12 on the year with a 4.74 ERA. \"For any team, having to play three games in 18 hours is a stretch, so I really wanted to go out there and try to get deep in the game. They battled and made me throw some pitches so it wasn't as deep as I wanted to go, but we did what we could.\"\n\nRelievers Josh Osich and Mark Melancon combined to throw two scoreless frames as the Giants' bullpen's shutout streak stretched to 20 2/3 innings. Melancon was making his first appearance since June 27 after being reinstated from the disabled list with an elbow injury.\n\nJones hopes Harper's OK\n\nGiants first baseman Ryder Jones beat Bryce Harper to first base in the first inning, just before Harper slipped on the bag, causing his leg to buckle. Harper stayed down on the field for several moments before leaving the game with a hyperextended left knee.\n\n\"It didn't look good,\" Jones said. \"I hope he's all right. It's just one of those freak plays where you kind of thought there would be a collision and there wasn't, and that might be part of it, too. Maybe he was trying to dodge me and Samardzija.\"\n\nThe start of Saturday's game was delayed more than three hours because of rain, and light rain continued to fall in the first and second innings. Jones suggested that may have contributed to Harper's injury as well.\n\n\"The top of the bases were wet, obviously, from the rain,\" he said. \"It looked like we were about to collide because Samardzija was kind of right there, too. Just a freak accident. I guess we'll find out what happened to him, but it didn't sound too good.\n\n\"He looked like he was in pretty good pain.

If you're telling me you're optimistic he'll play in any of them, you're not telling me much.\n\nNationals general manager Mike Rizzo said he felt the team \"dodged a bullet\" with this injury:\n\nThe Nationals plugged rookie Andrew Stevenson into Harper's place in the lineup last night, and have reportedly recalled Michael A. Taylor from a rehab assignment at Double-A Harrisburg, where he's working his way back from an oblique injury. Harper was placed on the 10-day disabled list, but Rizzo's comments don't inspire a lot of confidence that he'll be back out there before the end of August. Washington's outfield has been crushed by injuries this season -- all of Harper, Jayson Werth, Adam Eaton, Chris Heisey, and Ryan Rayburn are currently on the disabled list, and Taylor is just now coming off it -- but the prolonged absence of Harper would be by far the biggest blow. The injury looked pretty ugly -- the fact that there's no structural damage has to be good news.

(Michael Owens/USA TODAY Sports)\n\nAs the skies grew dark around the Washington area Saturday night, the massive thunderstorm and torrential rain that followed caused extensive delays for all three teams playing in the area: the Nationals, D.C. United and the Mystics.\n\nThe Nationals and Mystics were both delayed for extended periods of time, while D.C. United's match was postponed.\n\nThe Mystics, playing indoors at Capital One Arena, had the shortest delay of the night -- 45 minutes -- after a leak in the roof happened for the second time in 15 days. The same thing happened on July 28, when the Mystics had to cancel their game against the Connecticut Sun.\n\nOn Saturday, thunder could be heard clearly from inside the building before and during the delay.\n\nI don't remember being able to hear thunder SO loudly inside ~Capital One Arena~ buuut here we are. Fingers crossed nothing leaks\n\n-- Ava Wallace (@avarwallace) August 13, 2017\n\nThe delay started just before the beginning of the second half after water starting falling from the roof. But, the delay didn't hamper the mood of the players, who proceeded to participate in a dance-off. Mystics rookie Shatori Walker-Kimbrough and Natasha Cloud started the dance battle and after the game resumed, Washington went onto win 100-80 against the Indiana Fever. Mystics' Krystal Thomas had a season-high 20 points on the night.\n\nPer league rules, this game will now be decided by dance-off pic.twitter.com/yhENaMH5fo\n\n-- Ava Wallace (@avarwallace) August 13, 2017\n\nThe Nationals sat through a major delay of just over three hours before their series opener against the San Francisco Giants. The teams had already been through one rainout on Friday, that wasn't officially announced until about 9:45 p.m. Friday night. Giants Manager Bruce Bochy was informed of the postponement at 9:15 p.m. Friday, with Giants players already leaving the ballpark. That game was rescheduled for a split doubleheader on Sunday, with the first game of the day to start at 1:05 p.m. and the rescheduled game to start at 7:05 p.m.\n\n[Max Scherzer to start Sunday night in second half of doubleheader]\n\nOn Saturday, it was originally sunny when the delay was announced, around 6:50 p.m., to the dismay of fans who booed the decision. They were asked to leave their seats and the scoreboard instructed that inclement weather was on the way, with the Skittles-themed tarp rolling onto the field.\n\nSkittles getting money's worth at #Nationals Park this weekend. Start of tonight's #Nats game delayed w rain on way pic.twitter.com/TwmYnk0HdS\n\n-- Ben Raby (@BenRaby31) August 12, 2017\n\nThe storm wound up hitting strong about an hour later, rolling through Nationals Park accompanied by gusting winds whistling throughout the concourse.\n\nOk, yeah this rain delay is legit. #skittlestarpfordaysssss #Nats pic.twitter.com/cwsMkjVj2U\n\n-- Heather Zimmerman (@HeatherZiMS) August 13, 2017\n\nIt's been real, guys. pic.twitter.com/0xDBQujjlL\n\n-- Jorge Castillo (@jorgeccastillo) August 12, 2017\n\nWhen the rain finally did lighten up an hour or so later, it left its damage on the field with the warning track submerged in water. However, the grounds crew managed to get the field back in shape to play, with fans returning to their seats around 9:10 p.m. The first pitch was thrown at 10:06 p.m., with light rain still coming down. The Nationals wound up forced to try to play 27 innings in 24 hours.\n\nSubmerged. If you look close you can see the splashes...yikes. pic.twitter.com/amhpD8iIUP\n\n-- Jenifer Rodriguez (@Jenrod_) August 13, 2017\n\nThe rain caused more than a delay on Saturday for the Nationals. Right-fielder Bryce Harper had to leave the game in the first inning with an apparent left knee injury. As Harper was trying to beat out a groundball to first, he lunged and slipped on the bag. Wet conditions could have played a role in Harper's injury. He was helped off the field without putting any weight on his left leg.\n\nThe Bryce Harper injury #Nats #MLB @dcsportsbog pic.twitter.com/mMiI5S3rJe\n\n-- Brad P (@TheBradParker) August 13, 2017\n\nAs for D.C. United, the team was forced to postpone its match after RFK Stadium's field was turned into more of a lake than a soccer field.\n\nAnyone got a squeegee? #DCvRSL pic.twitter.com/Xj99RZGLcu\n\n-- Steven Goff (@SoccerInsider) August 13, 2017\n\nPhoto by Tony Quinn #DCvRSL pic.twitter.com/4VTtj3oDcw\n\n-- Steven Goff (@SoccerInsider) August 13, 2017\n\nUnlike the Nationals, United had already started its match against Real Salt Lake when the thunderstorm hit. In the 29th-minute, the teams had to stop play as the rain came falling down. After 90 minutes of thunder and lightning, the field began to drain, but the conditions were too wet to play in. Referee Drew Fischer called the match at about 9:05 p.m., and it was rescheduled for Sunday at 7 p.m. The teams will pick up from where they left off.\n\nUnited fans did their best to stay chipper as they waited out the storm.\n\nD.C. United is in last place? No one told the fans. Passing the time during the storm delay.

Bryce Harper has a \"significant bone bruise\" in his knee but no ligament damage, general manager Mike Rizzo told reporters Sunday.\n\nHarper was injured while running out a ground ball in the first inning Saturday, twisting his knee as he touched first base.\n\n\"We feel we dodged a bullet,\" Rizzo said. \"We're optimistic we'll see him this season.\"\n\nHarper, 24, was having another MVP-caliber season in driving the Nationals to a 69-45 record and 14 1/2-game lead in the National League East. He's slugged 29 home runs and his .326/.419/.645 slash line is second only to his 2015 MVP season, when he slugged a career-best 42 home runs.\n\nHe's expected to command a major league record contract - perhaps in excess of $400 million - when he hits the free agent market after the 2018 season.\n\nHarper's injury further dents a Nationals lineup that's been taking - and surviving - body blows since the first month of the season. Center fielder Adam Eaton suffered a torn ACL in April and is out for the season. Shortstop Trea Turner fractured his wrist in June and has commenced baseball-related activities, but the Nationals would be fortunate if he returned for more than the final 30 games of the regular season.\n\nAnd outfielders Michael A.

the San Francisco Giants at Nationals Park on August 12, 2017 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Greg Fiume/Getty Images)\n\nWashington Nationals right-hander Edwin Jackson had another solid outing Saturday night, tossing five scoreless innings against the San Francisco Giants after a one-run first -- all after waiting out a three-hour rain delay at Nationals Park.\n\nJackson (3-2) kept his composure after allowing a solo home run from Giants second baseman Joe Panik in the first inning, and was the winning pitcher in the 3-1 Nats victory. The 33-year-old's ERA improved to 3.30 in five starts since joining the team. He struggled a little early, throwing 23 pitches (only 12 strikes) in the first inning. He threw 100 pitches and 58 strikes total.\n\n\"Jackson was a little shaky early, had a lot of pitches, but settled down in the middle innings and took us to our pen and took us to the seventh,\" Manager Dusty Baker said. \"The seven, eight, nine guys did their job again . . . I'm just glad he (Jackson) gave us a victory tonight and we had just enough offense.\"\n\n[Nationals' Bryce Harper leaves win with apparent knee injury]\n\nJackson was originally scheduled to pitch Friday, but the game got postponed. The 15-year veteran had to mentally prepare to pitch again Saturday, and had to wait out an additional three hours because of more rain.\n\n\"It's a little tough but that's what we have to do as a professional,\" Jackson said. \"We have to make those adjustments and nobody wants to hear excuses. It's tough for both teams and both teams played a good game. It was a good game out there.\"\n\nJackson, was able to stay composed despite an apparent knee injury to Bryce Harper in the bottom of the first inning, which initially sucked the life out of Nationals Park as Harper was assisted off the field.\n\n\"Today was definitely one of those, dig-deep-and-see-what-you-made-of days,\" Jackson said. \"I was fortunate enough to come out with good results and also help out the bullpen at the same time with a solid six innings. It's one of those days when you really don't have your best stuff.\"\n\nSaturday's performance was an extension from the Jackson's last outing, Aug. 5 at Wrigley Field against the Chicago Cubs, when he threw four scoreless innings after allowing four runs in the first inning of the National's 7-4 loss. He retired 10 straight hitters after he gave up a two-run home run to Alex Avila that put the Cubs up 4-1 in the first inning. He also struck out eight without issuing a walk.\n\nJackson, who signed with Washington on June 16, wasn't originally moved into the team's rotation because of injuries to others.\n\nWith Joe Ross announced out for the year after Tommy John surgery in July, the Nationals needed a fifth starting pitcher. Jackson, who spent a month prior with Class AAA Syracuse, got his first shot at the starting role when he started in Los Angeles against the Angels and got the win after allowing only three hits and two runs in seven innings.\n\nMore on the Nationals:\n\nBryce Harper leaves game with apparent knee injury\n\nHeavy rainfall causes delays, postponement for Nationals, Mystics and D.C.

It's been raining the entire night: pic.twitter.com/O8HSQc0sMk -- Alex Pavlovic (@PavlovicNBCS)\n\nHarper hit a ground ball and ran hard into first base in an unsuccessful attempt to leg out an infield single. Harper lunged for the bag, and when his left foot made contact with it, it slipped forward through the surface of the base. The area around Harper's knee appeared to bend in a dangerous way, and he was holding it after he fell hard to the ground. No matter his status, that he was injured is a huge shame.\n\nThis might make you angry:\n\nIt was pouring in the Washington area on Saturday night. The game didn't start until 10:06 p.m. local time, three hours after the scheduled first-pitch time. When it rains in D.C. in the summer, it rains really hard, and this was a really hard rain.\n\nThe conditions just a few miles from Nationals Park looked like this:\n\nThe Yankees' Dustin Fowler suffered a season-ending knee injury in the first inning after a nearly three-hour delay at the White Sox in June. He had a ruptured patellar tendon in his right knee, the Yankees said. It was Fowler's major league debut, and he went down before he even got a plate appearance.\n\nThe Nationals drew criticism in July, when a home game against the Braves was delayed three hours despite little actual rain.\n\nThe Washington Post's Dan Steinberg wrote then:\n\nThat the Nats screwed up is obvious: Their decision-making was suspect (much of the delay was conducted without benefit of a tarp, a crucial clue that something was amiss); their communication was inadequate (fans weren't told what was going on until 9:35, about five minutes before the tarp was removed); and their response to the misfire unsatisfactory. By the time the teams started playing ball -- after a delay that lasted as long as a typical game -- most of the crowd was gone, and justifiably so: Kids had bedtimes, Metro was closing and the information void offered no particular reason to remain.\n\nGetting rain delays right can be a tricky thing. You don't want to keep fans hanging around for nothing. You don't want to play a game in conditions that are either dangerous or so messy that baseball can't adequately be played. You don't want to lose money, and you don't want to make people mad at you. This series is also the last one of the year between the two teams, and there's not much time left in the year, and they reside on opposite coasts. The league likes everyone to play 162 games. There are a lot of competing considerations, and it's not like these decisions are easy.\n\nNonetheless: The Nationals have a 14-game lead in the NL East. The Giants are way out of the race in the West. The Nats will not catch the league-leading Dodgers for the top seed in the NL playoffs, and they probably won't fall behind whoever wins the Central. This game is as close to meaningless as a regular season ballgame can be. But it happened anyway, and the league's most marketable star is now injured.\n\nMajor League Baseball, not the team, reportedly made the decision to play this game. Whoever decided it, Harper's injury by slippage makes it seem like a waste.", "timeCrawl": "03:33:00", "sim": 0.4980392158031464, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8867695", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "id": 36, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "id": 134, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Multiplayer", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Multiplayer", "id": 1009, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

With Chris Stratton set to face Edwin Jackson in the pitching matchup, the over/under currently sits at 10 runs.\n\nMLB Quick Links: Scores & Matchups | Injuries | Odds Comparison | Betting Trends | ATS Stats\n\nFrom Rotoworld: Stratton allowed three runs -- two earned -- over five innings Saturday in a no-decision versus the Diamondbacks. San Francisco would go on to win the game in extras, but Stratton didn't really help the cause. He gave up two runs in the first inning and one more in the fifth, walking four total batters and surrendering five hits. The right-hander will bring a 6.63 ERA and 1.74 WHIP into his next start on the road versus the NL East-leading Nationals.\n\nJackson yielded four earned runs over five innings Saturday in a loss to the Cubs. Jackson struck out eight batters and issued zero walks, but the Cubs got to him for six hits -- three of the extra-base variety. The veteran right-hander stands 2-2 on the season with a 4.34 ERA, 1.38 WHIP, and 22/9 K/BB ratio in four starts and three relief appearances covering 29 innings. He's lined up to face the Giants at home next.\n\nBet Tonight's Giants vs. Nationals Game\n\nOUR PREDICTION: The Giants have lost four straight meetings with the Nationals, have dropped five of six games in D.C., and are just 1-5 in their last six road games versus a team with a winning home record. On the other side, the Nationals have won four of their last five games, are 4-1 in their last five home games, and are 15-6 in their last 21 games versus National League West opponents. Both starters have struggled of late, but I have more faith in Washington's lineup to take advantage of Stratton than I do San Francisco's offense versus Jackson.\n\nFRIDAY MLB PREDICTION: WASHINGTON NATIONALS -1.5\n\nRecent MLB Discussions Mlb for Sat.

"time": "05:57:00", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "The Nationals have survived a lot already this year.\n\nThe early loss of Adam Eaton for the season.\n\nA shaky bullpen only recently shored up.\n\nThe loss of Trea Turner for an extended period.\n\nStephen Strasburg injury scares.\n\nAnd yet, those pale in comparison to the sight of all-everything outfielder Bryce Harper stepping awkwardly on first base, flying through the air as if launched out of a cannon and writhing around on the ground in pain, holding his left knee.\n\nThat was the scene Saturday, when Harper lost a race to the first base bag in the first inning and potentially lost even more in the split-second after, when his left foot slipped off the bag and sent him flying. Harper was in visible pain for minutes, testing the knee by trying in vain to extend it before being helped off the field, putting no weight on the knee.\n\n\"We just ask for prayers that it's not serious,\" Nationals manager Dusty Baker said after his team's 3-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants. \"He was in obvious pain, and he was praying and I was praying, too.\"\n\nIf there's good news, it's that the situation seemed less dire after the game. The Nationals said the 24-year-old had a hyperextended left knee, awaiting the results of an MRI before giving a final designation. And Harper, though not available to the media, was seen limping, but walking, around in the clubhouse after the game.\n\nNone of the losses endured or obstacles faced this season would compare to losing Harper for any extended period of time. The right fielder is batting .326/.419/.614 with 29 home runs, 87 RBI and 92 runs scored for the Nats, all of which rank among the best in the league in their respective categories.\n\nIf Harper is sidelined, it stands to reason that Michael Taylor, who is days away from returning from a rehab assignment, would inherit the lion's share of Harper's at-bats. Taylor has been out since July 6 but has been playing in rehab games in recent days as he rounds back into form.\n\nPerhaps it won't come to that, though. Baker was hopeful the news Sunday morning would be positive.\n\n\"The good thing is he's young and strong,\" Baker said. \"I'm very optimistic that he'll be at least fine shortly.\"\n\nEditor's Note: Win a FREE trip to the World Series plus cash prizes!\n\nBrewers Trade For Neil Walker\n\nThe Brewers, conspicuously quiet at the non-waiver trade deadline, added a piece to their middle infield Saturday in hopes of making a run into October.\n\nThe team acquired Neil Walker from the Mets in exchange for a player to be named later. The Mets also sent cash to the Brewers in the deal.\n\nThe timing of the move is interesting on multiple levels. For one, the position at which Walker was acquired to play, second base, has been manned by Jonathan Villar, who has been a disaster all season but who has shown signs of life at the plate in recent days. Brewers general manager David Stearns didn't address the playing time issue but did speak to why Walker was targeted by the club.\n\n\"I think we're banking on a professional hitter who has a robust track record of hitting quality pitching, especially from the left side of the plate,\" Stearns said. \"It took him a little while to get his timing back, but he seems to be back to his normal state right now.\"\n\nMore interesting is why the team decided to stand pat at the trade deadline, after leading the division as recently as July 25, but make a move the day after it found itself three games out and in third place in the Central. The Brewers were reportedly in on a number of trade discussions but didn't get any noteworthy deals done before July 31.\n\nWalker was hitting .264/.339/.442 at the time of the deal and does represent an upgrade from what the Brewers have gotten from the keystone this year. And the deal is low-risk enough that it almost can't end up being too disastrous, regardless of how it plays out.\n\nBeckham Bending Expectations In Baltimore\n\nIf it's fair to question why the Brewers weren't stronger buyers at the deadline, it's also fair to wonder why the Orioles were.\n\nAfter all, they weren't likely to catch the AL East-leading Red Sox, and a host of teams stood between the O's and the second Wild Card spot on July 31. The talk had actually been that the team would be sellers, with All-Star closer Zach Britton among the pieces the team had to offer.\n\nSo the team's acquisition of Tim Beckham from the Rays -- one of the teams ahead of the Orioles in the standings -- came as a surprise. Since then, it's his play that has been a surprise, a pleasant one for the O's.\n\nBeckham turned in a four-hit night Saturday, doubling three times, driving in three runs and scoring three himself in a lopsided win over the Athletics. With the good outing, Beckham upped his season line to .295/.344/.478.\n\nHe's been even more impressive as a member of the O's. Since the trade, the 27-year-old is 26-for-49 with nine multi-hit games. He's hit safely in all 12 games since the deadline.\n\nAt one time viewed as a huge bust, the former No. 1 overall pick might now be the future at shortstop for the Orioles.\n\nNational League Quick Hits: Stephen Strasburg (elbow) will make a rehab start Monday for High-A Potomac. He's scheduled to throw about 75 pitches in that outing. Strasburg tossed a successful bullpen session on Friday and made it through a short simulated game earlier in the week. The former first overall pick should be back in the Nats' rotation before long ... Giants activated RHP Mark Melancon from the 10-day disabled list. Melancon wasn't overly sharp during his four-game rehab stint (9.82 ERA over 3 2/3 innings) but at least his elbow is no longer bothering him. Sam Dyson will shift to a setup role with Melancon back to resume closer duties ... Jacob deGrom (triceps) threw his usual between-starts side session on Saturday. DeGrom left Thursday's start with a bruised triceps but is already on the mend. He'll be fine to make his next start Tuesday against the Yankees ... The Braves are expected to activate Matt Kemp (hamstring) from the disabled list on Friday. He'll be back for the start of Atlanta's nine-game homestand, which begins Friday against Cincinnati. Kemp is far enough along in his recovery that he won't require a rehab assignment ... Rockies signed 1B Ryan Howard to a minor league contract. It's the first we've heard of Howard since the Braves cut him loose in early May. Howard's power would theoretically play well at Coors Field, though the 37-year-old didn't show much during an 11-game stint with Triple-A Gwinnett earlier this year (.184 AVG, 1 HR, 5 RBI in 38 at-bats). He'll likely begin his Rockies tenure with Triple-A Albuquerque. The odds of him rediscovering a previous form are very low, but so is the risk for the Rockies. Win-win.\n\nAmerican League Quick Hits: Yankees placed RHP Masahiro Tanaka on the 10-day disabled list with right shoulder inflammation. Tanaka didn't look right in his last start, walking five batters in his four-plus innings of work, and perhaps now we know why ... Red Sox placed 2B Dustin Pedroia on the 10-day disabled list, retroactive to August 9, with left knee inflammation. Pedroia has been battling the knee injury since late July. Eduardo Nunez is expected to see the bulk of the action at second base while he's out with Rafael Devers handling third base ... Indians manager Terry Francona said Jason Kipnis (hamstring) could return to the lineup as soon as Sunday. Kipnis aggravated a pre-existing hamstring injury on Thursday night but it's not considered a long-term issue. He'll be available off the bench on Saturday and should be back in there for Sunday's series finale against the Rays ... Mitch Haniger (face) will begin a minor league rehab assignment with Triple-A Tacoma on Saturday. It will be Haniger's first game action since being hit in the face last month. He'll DH for the Rainiers on Saturday, though it shouldn't be long until he's ready to play the outfield ... Chris Rowley was victorious in his big league debut against the Pirates on Saturday, allowing one run on five hits over 5 1/3 innings. The rookie right-hander walked one and struck out three on the afternoon. The only blemish on his day came on a two-out RBI single by Jordy Mercer in the second inning. Despite the strong start, it's likely that he's ticketed for a trip back to Triple-A soon.", "timeCrawl": "08:57:00", "sim": 0.4235294163227081, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1886, "date": "2017-07-06", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1892}, {"textStart": 3374, "date": "2017-07-25", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3381}, {"imp": true, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3599, "date": "2017-07-31", "textStart": 3592}, {"textStart": 7087, "date": "2017-08-09", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 7095}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8892972", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/War_and_Politics", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/War and Politics", "id": 317, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "id": 641, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Abstract", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Abstract", "id": 751, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Multiplayer", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Multiplayer", "id": 1009, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

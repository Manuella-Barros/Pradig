With, as with seemingly every endorsable product on the market at the moment, Jimmy Butler the face of the campaign. (Is there another athlete who currently can book you a hotel room, get you set with streaming in your room, and have a beer available on demand in said room?) Then again, did anyone actually expect crickets during this period between Pat Riley\u2019s contract challenge earlier this month and the opening of Butler\u2019s Miami Heat extension window in July? So now, out of Butler\u2019s once \u2013 and perhaps again \u2013 home, a report that the Philadelphia 76ers would be willing to offer a maximum contract extension if Butler were to be acquired in a trade. Understand, Butler\u2019s extension window with the Heat does not open until July 7. Also understand that, by rule, an extension from an acquiring team in most cases could not be offered until six months after such a trade. No matter. Not in the tamper-ific NBA, not in a league where the 76ers have made clear to those in the know of also having decided interest in impending Los Angeles Clippers free-agent forward Paul George. So, no, Butler-Riley will not be tabled until July \u2013 at least not the conjecture. In a perfect word, Riley gets Butler to show a commitment to more than the 60 games he played this past season. \u201cThat\u2019s a big decision on our part to commit those kinds of resources unless you have somebody who\u2019s going to be there and available every single night,\u201d Riley said earlier this month. In Riley\u2019s perfect world, the extension discussion waits until after next season. Riley said as much when he addressed the media on May 6 at Kaseya Center. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do that for a year,\u201d he said. Asked at the time if he would consider a Butler trade, Riley said, \u201cNo. Not right now.\u201d It\u2019s not \u201cright now\u201d anymore. It\u2019s open season on speculation. Among Butler\u2019s options are playing out the final two years on his current Heat deal, playing out next season and then invoking his right to opt into free agency in the 2025 offseason, or requesting a trade somewhere along the way. The last time Butler reached a similar crossroads, he forced his way out of Minnesota at the start of the 2018-19 season, with boorish behavior to the point that the Timberwolves had enough. Butler\u2019s savior at that moment? The 76ers. Which is why the latest out of Philadelphia cannot be summarily dismissed, even amid the reality that 76ers President Daryl Morey was not with the team when Philadelphia acquired Butler from the Timberwolves on Nov. 12, 2018, nor when the 76ers dealt him on July 6, 2019 to the Heat. As it is, the reason Butler was not available to the Heat in the playoffs was a knee injury sustained in a play-in loss in Philadelphia, yet another element tying the teams together. Butler\u2019s representation has made it clear that the Heat will be hearing from them at 12:01 a.m. on July 7, with the request for the maximum two-year, $112.9 million extension that will take Butler past his 36th birthday. With a seed seemingly planted elsewhere, it appears nothing less will suffice. Yes, Riley can stand his ground, ground he is afforded by Butler\u2019s extension window remaining open through next season. But this is a players\u2019 league, where the leverage tilts decidedly in favor of labor. It also is a tampering league, when outside parties have a way of making their intentions known through surrogate means. For his part, Butler has said little, perhaps awaiting to offer full disclosure in his upcoming Netflix docuseries. For now, the only comment was telling GQ of the Heat, \u201cI feel at home, man. I really care about the city. I really care about the people in this city. Miami has embraced me. They\u2019ve wanted me to bring them something.\u201d Meanwhile, if the market had not already been set, it is now. Jimmy Butler will be getting paid. The only remaining questions now are . . . By whom? And when? In Pat Riley\u2019s view, time is on his side. As the news of the moment indicates, that might not exactly be the case.", "summary": "Did anyone actually expect crickets during this period between Pat Riley's challenge earlier this month until the opening of Jimmy Butler's Miami Heat extension window in July?", "url": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2024/05/29/winderman-and-just-like-that-clock-ticking-on-heat-pat-riley-jimmy-butler/", "image": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jimmy.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:06:23", "author": "Ira Winderman", "authors": ["Ira Winderman"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.364}

That was in 2008: a time of promise and partnership with Beijing. Fast forward 16 years and those 80 support pillars are now gone, torn down after the ambitious Northrail scheme was abandoned amid allegations of corruption and mismanagement. Yet 200km to the northwest, a new structure is taking shape \u2013 one with very different intentions. Inside a Philippine naval base on the western shores of Luzon, workers are quietly erecting the country\u2019s first supersonic cruise missile outpost. With a 300km range, the BrahMos missiles will be capable of striking Scarborough Shoal, where Chinese naval forces have gathered. This burgeoning military installation represents the latest flashpoint in the Philippines\u2019 increasingly acrimonious stand-off with its one-time partner. What began as a story of infrastructure cooperation has morphed into an epic tale of betrayal and confrontation, the once-chummy relationship between Manila and Beijing giving way to escalating geopolitical rivalry. The rise and fall of those Northrail pillars now bookend a new, more ominous chapter. At the heart of the falling out is Beijing\u2019s assertion, through its \u201cnine-dash-line\u201d \u2013 lately expanded to 10-dashes \u2013 that it owns nearly all of the South China Sea. Its expansive maritime claim has led China to encroach on waters over which the Philippines also claims sovereignty. \u201cI think relations are the worst in recent memory because the hostility and aggression of China at both the strategic and tactical levels are palpable,\u201d former senator and retired naval officer Antonio Trilllanes told This Week in Asia. Indeed, ties are \u201cat their lowest ebb and on the brink of total breakdown\u201d, according to Teresita Ang-See, founder of Kaisa, an organisation representing Chinese-Filipinos that aims to foster understanding and tolerance between cultures. \u201cNever have the churning waters reached boiling point as now,\u201d she said. A routine resupply mission to a remote outpost on the Second Thomas Shoal turned violent on June 17, when Chinese vessels launched an attack on Filipino forces within the Philippines\u2019 exclusive economic zone. In the chaos, a Filipino special forces soldier lost his thumb after his boat was deliberately rammed by a Chinese coastguard vessel. Chinese coastguard personnel wielding axes and machetes then boarded the Philippine boats, trashing equipment, seizing phones and firearms, and towing the vessels away \u2013 a shocking escalation in the bitter territorial dispute over the strategic waterway. The Philippine military was quick to condemn China\u2019s \u201cbarbaric actions\u201d in a post on the X social media platform. Beijing, however, offered a starkly different account. Chinese officials claimed their personnel were simply defending Chinese territory, despite the fact that the Second Thomas Shoal is situated more than 1,100km away from the nearest Chinese land mass and is some 194km from Philippine shores. The officials also alleged the resupply mission was violating a prior agreement. As the two sides trade accusations, the risk of further miscalculation and escalation remains ever-present in the strategic waterway. It wasn\u2019t the first time Chinese forces had disrupted a resupply mission to a grounded World War II-era warship at Second Thomas Shoal that acts as a Philippine outpost in the South China Sea, previously resorting to ramming and water cannon attacks to block and impede operations. But this latest incident marked a significant escalation, with the Philippine troops under strict orders not to open fire or fight back even in the face of brazen aggression. China \u201cwould like to push us to fire the first shot\u201d, Philippine Navy spokesman Commodore Roy Vincent Trinidad told local media on June 20, three days after the incident. Beijing maintains that a secret agreement was made with a senior Philippine navy officer regarding resupply missions to the ship, the BRP Sierra Madre. But both President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr and the navy officer involved have separately denied that any such agreement ever existed. Meanwhile, Chinese ships have been sailing into and through the Philippines\u2019 exclusive economic zone, including a 12,000-tonne vessel dubbed \u2018The Monster\u2019, the world\u2019s largest coastguard ship. On June 25, Philippine armed forces spokesman Colonel Francel Margareth Padilla told the Inquirer newspaper that these Chinese ship movements are \u201cpart of a broader pattern of intrusive patrols aimed at asserting unlawful claims\u201d within the Southeast Asian nation\u2019s EEZ. \u201cIt\u2019s clear, China wants to grab our island territories and maritime zones,\u201d retired Supreme Court associate justice and maritime rights crusader Antonio Carpio told This Week in Asia, calling the June 17 incident a significant escalation. \u201cThis is a higher level, it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve boarded our auxiliary ships,\u201d he said. Faced with the loss of maritime territory and untold resources within its EEZ, the Philippines has tried various approaches over the years, from legal action to appeasement, military modernisation, and seeking alliances. In 2013, the administration of President Benigno Aquino filed a UN arbitration case challenging China\u2019s nine-dash line claims. The Philippines won the case in 2016, but Beijing rejected the tribunal\u2019s ruling. When Rodrigo Duterte became president in 2016, he took a friendlier approach. He flew to Beijing, announced a pivot away from the Philippines\u2019 US alliance, and set aside the tribunal decision. Duterte also permitted China to build a \u201cfriendship bridge\u201d in Manila and the Chinese ambassador even released a song celebrating the two countries\u2019 ties. However, the expected Chinese investments did not materialise, and China continued to assert its territorial claims and encroach on the Philippine EEZ, despite the warming relations under Duterte. \u201cWe were really just giving away our island territories and maritime zones to China\u201d at that time, Carpio said. When Marcos took office in 2022, some thought he would be Beijing\u2019s \u201cManchurian candidate\u201d, but instead he drew The Philippines closer to the US and supported military modernisation. Now, he faces the challenge of an increasingly assertive Beijing, while also fending off accusations that he is turning his country into a puppet of the United States that could be dragged into a war over Taiwan. A weak link in the chain The South China Sea has long been a point of contention between the Philippines and China, with two disputed features in particular serving as flashpoints: the Second Thomas Shoal and Scarborough Shoal. Both are claimed by Manila and Beijing, with the dilapidated Philippine warship BRP Sierra Madre functioning as a military outpost in the former, while the latter is a traditional fishing ground for Filipino fishermen. Analysts argue that China is exerting particular pressure on the Philippines for a few key reasons. First, the Philippines\u2019 geographic location is strategically significant, because it, Japan and Taiwan comprise what is known in US foreign policy circles as the \u201cfirst island chain\u201d, preventing easy access from the Asian mainland to the open Pacific. China sees the Philippines as a weak link in this chain. Its strategy of \u201ckill the chicken to scare the monkey\u201d, outlined by foreign affairs magazine The Diplomat a decade ago, dictates that it will \u201cgo after lesser powers to diminish the role or prevent the involvement of a greater power\u201d. Manila\u2019s policy of building up its military and strengthening its alliances with extra-regional powers also makes it a target. Under Marcos, the Philippines has granted American forces access to four additional military facilities called EDCA sites in the northern Philippines, closer to Taiwan, as well as one facing the disputed Spratly Islands. As a result, the US now has a presence across nine military camps scattered throughout the country. China will use \u201cany means\u201d to achieve its \u201cultimate objective\u201d of \u201cstopping the EDCA bases from attaining fully operational status\u201d, according to Trillanes, who also helped author a 2012 law to modernise the Philippine military. All of which leaves the Philippine leadership in something of a quandary. China is the Philippines\u2019 largest source of imports and trade relations have remained unaffected, so far. But diplomacy between the two has hit a stone wall. \u201cEvery time we sit down with China, it will say there\u2019s nothing to discuss because it has owned the South China Sea since 2,000 years ago,\u201d Carpio said. The June 17 incident was \u201ca continuation of China\u2019s plan to control the South China Sea\u201d, he said. \u201cThat started in 1947 \u2026 slowly, as they increased their naval might, they\u2019ve continued to grab and grab.\u201d What really \u201caggrieved\u201d Beijing was the four new EDCA sites, according to Filipino businessman and writer Wilson Lee Flores, who supported closer relations with China under Duterte. \u201cI think that\u2019s when things went wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore then, things were normal, right?\u201d Philippine public opinion appears to be hardening in tandem with China\u2019s increased assertiveness. Almost three in every four Filipinos now favour the use of military force to uphold the nation\u2019s sovereignty and maritime rights, a March survey by Octa Research found. But the government isn\u2019t so trigger-happy. Four days after the June 17 clash, the highest ranking official in Marcos\u2019 office, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, characterised the incident as a probable \u201cmisunderstanding or accident\u201d, which would not trigger a seven decade-old defence treaty that binds the US to come to Manila\u2019s aid in the event of an attack. A day later, Marcos himself declared \u201cwe are not in the business to instigate wars\u201d while visiting troops at the Philippines\u2019 South China Sea forces headquarters in Palawan province. \u201cOur great ambition is to provide a peaceful and prosperous life for every Filipino,\u201d he said. For Manila\u2019s defence chief, June 17 was \u201ca deliberate act of the Chinese officialdom\u201d, which he said on Monday was orchestrated \u201cto prevent us from completing our mission\u201d. Defence Secretary Gilberto Teodoro\u2019s fighting talk was belatedly matched by Marcos, who said on Thursday that he and his officials \u201chave to do more\u201d than just protest against China\u2019s \u201cdeliberate and illegal action\u201d \u2013 without elaborating. On social media, Filipinos were quick to decry the government\u2019s apparent inaction. The Philippine public \u201cexpects you to retaliate\u201d, an account calling itself \u201cWest Philippine Sea\u201d posted on X on June 23. \u201cWe understand that the Military Option may not yet be advisable \u2026 [but] do something! Expel a few diplomats \u2026 file criminal and civil cases \u2026 anything other than NOTHING!\u201d Maritime law expert Jay Batongbacal, director of the University of the Philippines\u2019 Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea, joined calls for the Chinese ambassador and embassy staff to be expelled. \u201cWe need to send them back,\u201d he said in an interview on GMA Network\u2019s 24 Oras news show. Filipino paranoia Footage of the June 17 incident further unsettled a Philippine public already uneasy about the proliferation of Chinese-controlled offshore gambling companies known as Pogos. Under the Duterte administration, this lightly regulated sector was promoted as a source of economic growth, but instead brought a surge in criminality, corruption, and an influx of undocumented mainland Chinese, some of whom were wanted criminals. Further feeding Filipino paranoia about the Pogo industry was the case of Alice Guo, mayor of Bamban town in Tarlac province. Guo was found to have intimate ties to a massive Pogo operation located a stone\u2019s throw from her own office. She struggled to provide basic details about her background during Senate hearings into her case, was unable to produce any records of her birth or schooling, and offered conflicting accounts of her family and upbringing. Senator Win Gatchalian presented documents purportedly proving that Guo is actually a Chinese citizen named Guo Hua Ping. Amid the damning revelations, the Office of the Ombudsman ordered Guo\u2019s suspension from office. Meanwhile, a recent raid on an illegal Pogo complex in Pampanga province uncovered another disturbing find: Chinese military uniforms. The discovery only heightened suspicions that the industry is being exploited by Beijing, both to embed agents within the Philippines and conduct electronic espionage targeting military installations. Both China and the Philippines are playing into the hands of provocateurs and hawks who want nothing more than to see our two countries at loggerheads Teresita Ang-See, Kaisa founder But Kaisa founder Ang-See called this a \u201cridiculous misconception\u201d. \u201cThe evils brought about by Pogos \u2013 gambling-related kidnappings, human-trafficking related kidnappings \u2013 and the maritime dispute over the West Philippine Sea have all been lumped into one catch-all bogeyman,\u201d she said. \u201cBoth China and the Philippines are playing into the hands of provocateurs and hawks who want nothing more than to see our two countries at loggerheads.\u201d China\u2019s actions on June 17 were \u201cindefensible\u201d, Ang-see said, but Philippine \u201cpublic pronouncements should be more discriminating to avoid pouring oil onto the fire\u201d. University of the Philippines history professor emeritus Ricardo Jose drew unsettling parallels between the paranoia surrounding the Pogo industry and the lead-up to World War II in the Philippines. \u201cThe stories of Chinese infiltrators remind me of what happened back then,\u201d Jose said. \u201cThe Japanese sent some officers here as spies before the war disguised as salesmen \u2026 Some local Japanese were hired as intelligence sources too.\u201d It\u2019s a concerning echo of the past \u2013 in 1941, China and the US, which governed the Philippines as a commonwealth, were allies against Japan. Now, the tables have turned, with the Philippines, the US, and Japan standing as allies, while the perceived threat emanates from China. \u201cIf we have the world on our side, China cannot do what it wants,\u201d Carpio told This Week in Asia. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need to get the rest of the world to support us here, and I think they will \u2026 China in the long run is in a no-win situation.\u201d", "summary": "Their churning South China Sea quarrel has now reached \u2018boiling point\u2019 \u2013 and Filipinos are demanding action.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3268506/china-philippines-ties-brink-total-breakdown-unpacking-collapse", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/06/28/dc8d2d48-745d-4c5d-b506-fb06b7a83032_8f6293ce.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:30:20", "author": "Alan Robles,Raissa Robles", "authors": ["Alan Robles", "Raissa Robles"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": 0.238}

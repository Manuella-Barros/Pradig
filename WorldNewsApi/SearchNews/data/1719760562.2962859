{"id": 225001742, "title": "One Donald Trump Juror Has Legal Expert Worried", "text": "A juror in Donald Trump's hush money case is making a legal expert \"worry\" because they seem \"less engaged and slightly irritable.\"Writing on X, formerly Twitter, former deputy assistant attorney general Harry Litman said he wasn't the only one anxious about the trial behavior of this juror, who cannot be identified due to an anonymity order.Jury instructions are expected on Wednesday, following closing arguments in the case. The case is set to determine, as alleged in a criminal indictment, whether Trump falsified business records over payments to former adult film star Stormy Daniels to keep an alleged affair between them secret ahead of the 2016 election. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has pleaded not guilty to all 34 charges.\"There's one juror that people are worried about and I share the worry. can't identify her or him per judge's orders but seems less engaged and slightly irritable,\" Litman wrote.Newsweek contacted a representative for Trump by email to comment on this storyAlso, an anonymous court attendee told the Bulwark that one juror has appeared to nod along with the defense to express agreement. Newsweek was unable to verify this information.However, speaking to Newsweek, former federal prosecutor Gene Rossi said it was \"risky\" to read into the juror's body language. He said: \"'Tasseography' is a serious affliction that even highly-experienced trial attorneys engage in. And often to their dismay. The ability to accurately predict by reading the facial 'tea leaves' of what is in a juror's mind is risky. One predicts at his peril.\"Family law attorney Lexi Rigden also presented an alternate take. She wrote on X: \"It is pointless to speculate about jurors based on random snippets of behavior in the box. Remember the 'crying' juror in the Murdaugh trial who wasn't actually crying at all? We will know soon enough whether former President Donald Trump is guilty, acquitted, or, there is a mistrial.\"During an appearance on CNN, she added that even if there is one juror who favors Trump, they may be peer pressured by other jurors to make a unanimous decision in the case. Hanging the jury, she said, would need someone with \"intestinal fortitude\" to \"stand up and disagree with 11 other people.\"\"A lot of times that doesn't necessarily happen based on human nature,\" she said.Elsewhere, Trump was widely ridiculed by legal experts after he suggested that his lawyers should get the \"final word\" during closing arguments. It is standard practice that the prosecution delivers closing arguments to the jury second as the burden of proof falls on them.\"WHY IS THE CORRUPT GOVERNMENT ALLOWED TO MAKE THE FINAL ARGUMENT IN THE CASE AGAINST ME? WHY CAN'T THE DEFENSE GO LAST? BIG ADVANTAGE, VERY UNFAIR. WITCH HUNT,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social.", "summary": "Harry Litman described one juror in Trump's hush money trial as \"less engaged and slightly irritable.\"", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-hush-money-case-jury-1905723", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2400498/donald-trump.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:08:47", "author": "Kate Plummer", "authors": ["Kate Plummer"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.452}

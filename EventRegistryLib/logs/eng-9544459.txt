The dress featured a long train draping from her shoulder. This marks Jennie's second appearance at the Met Gala, having first attended in 2023. At the time, she wore a vintage Chanel dress: a strapless white minidress.\n\nFans went crazy after seeing Jennie's Met Gala red carpet look and showered their beloved star with cheesy compliments. One user wrote, \"Everyone is calling her name \"Jennie right here\" for a picture this is just insane.\" Another one said, \"Look how gorgeous she is.\"\n\nJennie was spotted at South Korea's Incheon airport leaving for New York City on May 2, 2024, which made fans speculate about her 2024 Met Gala appearance.\n\nLast month, Jennie dropped an exciting music video with Zico. Titled 'Spot', the music video offered a glimpse into what seemed to be an electrifying release from the two. While Jennie, one of the most popular K-pop stars, can be seen lending her voice and featuring alongside Zico, the music video also featured some goofy moments as the duo immersed themselves in the rhythm of the track, dancing, and vibing to the music amidst the urban backdrop of the city.\n\nOn the work front, Jennie recently launched her solo label Odd Atelier, while also remaining associated with her agency for group activities with BLACKPINK. Zico's last musical outing was the mini album Grown Ass Kid in July 2022.

And, to quote Cher Horowitz, you don't understand, it's custom Ala\u00efa. The dress features a long train draping from her shoulder.\n\nJennie kept it monochromatic, wearing a pair of heeled pumps tied around her ankle in the exact same blue Klein shade. For accessories, she added dangly pearls in a silvery white and a matching belly chain.

Jennie was spotted at South Korea's Incheon airport leaving for New York City on May 2, 2004, which made fans raise their brows.\n\nThe musician made her way to NYC to attend the Gentle Monster \"Jentle Salon\" pop-up in Brooklyn in honor of her latest collaboration with the eyewear brand. The star rocked a backless Jacquemus LBD for the occasion, paired with the Hush 01 black sunnies from her collection.\n\nAfter her Gentle Monster duties were done, Jennie took the chance to have fun around the city with fellow BLACKPINK member Ros\u00e9 before being spotted leaving a mysterious location on her own on May 5, presumably for her Met Gala fitting.\n\nJennie made her Met Gala debut in 2023, wearing a '90s vintage look from Chanel.

The \"Solo\" crooner debuted at the Met Gala in 2023 and attended the annual event again in 2024.\n\nJennie Kim is the official brand ambassador of the luxury fashion brand Chanel. But what makes her outfits stand out among many of her peers is her subtle approach to minimalism. Whether at the Met Gala or a fashion show appearance, Jennie always snatches eyes with minimal fashion statements that imbibe elegance and grace.\n\nA look at Jennie Kim's minimalist Met Gala outfits\n\nThe anticipation of seeing what Blackpink Jennie wears at the Met Gala 2024 was high before the May 6 event. And, once again, Jennie has proven that her signature graceful style can transcend any current trend, staying tall in its evergreen, elegant aura.\n\nJennie made her Met Gala debut in 2023 wearing a chic, vintage Chanel look that few had expected. The 28-year-old songstress wore a reinterpreted look from Lagerfeld's fall 1990 ready-to-wear collection, which dabbles in black and white. Jennie prefers minidresses for all occasions, and the Met Gala was no different.\n\nShe wore a white satin bustier dress, pairing it with a white camellia and a black ribbon tie on the bodice. The K-pop singer also donned a matching flower in her hair and kept the makeup relatively simple, with an overall nude look and a touch of pink. She finished the look with black stockings for her legs and hands and a black high heel to define her posture.\n\nIn 2024, Jennie left her comfort zone and chose a bold royal blue dress for her Met Gala look. Pieter Mulier designed Jennie's latest custom Ala\u00efa look. According to reports, the dress took 200 hours to make and used over 13 meters of fabric.\n\nUnlike last year, Jennie's latest Met outfit was bolder. A flowing train added a new spring element to the look, fitting the theme of \"The Garden of Time.\" Jennie chose not to make accessories complicated by wearing big drop earrings, a matching belly chain, and royal blue heels.\n\nInstead of wearing her hair down, Jennie's signature style, she also chose an updo with twisting buns this year. The most stunning part of her makeup was her eyes, which included bold eyeliner and glitter. These added a more icy-cool vibe to the overall look, a refreshing change after several minimal, barely there makeup looks.\n\nJennie also maintained the bold theme for her Met Gala 2024 afterparty look. The Idol star sported a black halter-neck dress, a fur coat, and a sleek bun for her afterparty look. She carried a matching stone-studded black bag and paired it with strappy heels to complete the look.\n\nMeanwhile, Blackpink Jennie has also made a fresh start in her solo K-pop career after not renewing her contract with YG Entertainment.

Jennie is often referred to as \"Human Chanel\" by South Korea outlets for her affinity to the brand, as well as being the fashion house's brand ambassador for years.\n\n\"I remember when I was little, I look through my mother's wardrobe, and search for whatever vintage Chanel I could find,\" Jennie told Elle Magazine in January 2019.\n\nThe 2023 Met Gala's theme is inspired by German fashion designer, Karl Lagerfeld. He was best known as the creative director of Chanel, a position he held from 1983 until his death in February 2019. As Jennie has been an ambassador for Chanel for years, she formed a close bond to Karl prior to his passing.\n\nFun fact: Jennie was also the last house ambassador chosen by Karl prior to his death for Chanel.\n\nFollowing Karl's passing, Jennie posted a photo of the fashion legend along a heartwarming message. \"Thank you for sharing your intelligence and generosity with the world, truly a legend. We will remember and appreciate your existence forever.\"\n\nJennie became the first BLACKPINK member to debut solo in November 2018, with the aptly named song \"SOLO.\" On top of that, the singer-songwriter is set to make her acting debut in HBO's The Idol in 2023, which was cocreated by Euphoria creator Sam Levinson, The Weeknd and Reza Fahim.", "source": {"uri": "j-14.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "J-14"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hanna_wickes@j-14.com", "name": "Hanna Wickes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpink", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Black Pink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chanel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weeknd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Weeknd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennie_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jennie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Lagerfeld", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karl Lagerfeld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Girl group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-pop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K-pop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YG_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YG Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creative director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_ambassador", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brand ambassador"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elle (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Idol_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Idol (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Levinson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Levinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.j-14.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2151789023.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3302px%2C1736px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544459", "eventUri": "eng-9544459", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 97, "textEnd": 102}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-08-", "textStart": 447, "textEnd": 458}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-01-", "textStart": 816, "textEnd": 828}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-02-", "textStart": 1015, "textEnd": 1028}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-11-", "textStart": 1543, "textEnd": 1556}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Because once you get caught in one life, if that's not balanced, I think that's when everything starts collapsing. I don't think one specific thing could de-stress me, because we've got something going on every single moment, but keeping a positive mind, just taking care of your mental health and your body, is definitely something that I do.... I meditate, stretch, read, sleep.\"\n\nShe also shared what advice she'd give her 10-year-old self: \"If anything, I could go back to 10-year-old Jennie and be like, 'Work harder on your English. There's a lifetime waiting for you in doing interviews and meeting people who speak that language.' [But] it's also a life lesson to learn. There's a graph in your life for a reason, I like to think.

Here's The Truth", "body": "BLACKPINK's Jennie made a stunning appearance at the Met Gala 2024, donning a breathtaking blue gown that captured the essence of this year's theme, 'The Garden of Time'. While some critics questioned her outfit's alignment with the theme, fans were quick to come to her defence, highlighting the thoughtful interpretation behind her choice.\n\nThe Met Gala's theme for 2024, inspired by J.G. Ballard's short story, focused on three elements: Land, Sea and Sky. Jennie's ensemble, a radiant blue dress designed by Pieter Mulier, was seen as a clever nod to the 'Sea' component of the theme. The dress, which took over 200 hours to craft, featured an asymmetric drape with a cut-out waist and a long train, culminating in a ruffled waist. This design was influenced by styles seen in recent 'Ala\u00efa' collections.\n\nIn addition to her gown, Jennie wore minimal accessories, including a pearl waist chain and matching large pearl earrings, which complemented her marine-themed strappy heels. Fans argued that Jennie's outfit not only adhered to the theme but also showcased her unique take on the Gala's broad motif. While many attendees opted for interpretations centred on land and floral elements, Jennie stood out by embodying the sea.\n\nSupporters on social media rallied to the BLACKPINK star's defense, with many praising her for her clever interpretation of the theme. One fan tweeted, \"Jennie is actually smart for picking a sea coz everyone will interpret the theme as plants or a literal garden but her choosing a sea and royal blue makes her standout.\"", "source": {"uri": "english.jagran.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jagran English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpink", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black Pink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

I love Blackpink. I very much had a crush on Jennie for a long time.\" In The Idea of You, Galitzine plays the lead singer of a popular boy band. To prepare for the role, Galitzine said that BTS and Blackpink served as \"really interesting reference points for the physicality\" of his character.\n\nThis is not the first time that Galitzine has mentioned his crush on Jennie. Back in October 2020, in a now-deleted post, he mentioned watching the Netflix documentary on Blackpink. He shared a photo of Jennie and wrote, \"I just watched the Blackpink documentary and... #blink\".\n\nIn February 2021, the Bottoms star wrote on X that he thought Jennie had replied to one of his posts.\n\nThis year, Jennie and Galitzine attended the MET Gala. One can hope that perhaps Galitzine had the opportunity to express his appreciation to Jennie in person.\n\nJennie reached global fame after debuting as a member of Blackpink, formed by YG Entertainment, in August 2016. Since her debut, she has made a number of records as part of the four-member group and also as a solo artist. Her first solo song, named Solo, became the maiden song by a female K-pop soloist to surpass one billion views on YouTube. The rapper is also the most-followed Korean individual on Instagram with 84.6 million followers and needless to say, Nicholas Galitzine is one of them. Jennie made her acting debut in 2023, in the HBO television series The Idol.\n\nK-pop idols are known for avoiding any and all dating rumours, as a result, they rarely address praise made by celebrities of the opposite gender. While Jennie has so far not commented on Galitzine's public praises, it is not impossible to think that they might share the screen in future.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpink", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Black Pink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BTS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Golitsyn", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "House of Golitsyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-pop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "K-pop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Idea_of_You_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Idea of You (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Galitzine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Galitzine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "GQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coachella_(festival)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coachella (festival)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stray_Kids", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stray Kids"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_idol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Korean idol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supergroup_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supergroup (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lollapalooza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lollapalooza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Korean language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aespa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aespa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Aespa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Estonia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camila_Cabello", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Camila Cabello"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_band", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boy band"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Musical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinderella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YG_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YG Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Emo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Emo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/05/untitled-design-19-2024-05-a4abfa55a93ac7a3bb64a679af7b7b9b-16x9.png?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544459", "eventUri": "eng-9544459", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-10-", "textStart": 1247, "textEnd": 1259}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-08-", "textStart": 1805, "textEnd": 1816}], "sentiment": 0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

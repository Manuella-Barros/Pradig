{"id": 225026442, "title": "Volcanic eruption sends lava soaring near Grindavik in Iceland", "text": "A massive lava eruption can be seen coming from a volcano near Grindavik in Iceland as evacuations take place. Increased seismic activity near the Sundhn\u00fakar craters on the Reykjanes peninsula has prompted evacuations in Grindav\u00edk and the Blue Lagoon due to the likelihood of a volcanic eruption. As noted in an announcement from the Icelandic Meteorological Office this morning, increased seismic activity has been recorded near the Sundhn\u00fakar craters on the Reykjanes peninsula, which could precede a volcanic eruption or magma intrusion. The Met Office said in its latest update: \"An eruption has started near Sundhn\u00fak and seems to be located northeast of S\u00fdlingafell. The jets reach a height of at least 50 meters and the length of the crater appears to be over 1 kilometer. The Coast Guard helicopter was taking off to determine the exact location and size of the eruption. More information will be available soon.\" It earlier said: \"A magma run has begun. All signals seen in the run-up to previous eruptions are now visible on measuring instruments. Local and intense microseismic activity, pressure variation in boreholes and deformation signals on GPS meters. There is an increased chance that this magma flow will lead to an eruption.\"", "summary": "Huge waves of lava can be seen coming from a volcanic eruption near Grindavik in Iceland as more activity affects the area with evacuations having already taken place in the Blue Lagoon tourist area", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-volcanic-eruption-sends-lava-32914165", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32917142.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_AHP_CHP_26375.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:09:22", "author": "Tim Hanlon,Tim-hanlon", "authors": ["Tim Hanlon", "Tim-hanlon"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.526}

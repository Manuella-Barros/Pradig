There are ramps, steps and scaffolding in the way, and it's something Timberwolves coach Chris Finch is finding out as he coaches this Western Conference second-round series shortly after undergoing patellar tendon surgery in his right knee.\n\nBefore Game 1, Finch climbed up a few steps to take his seat at a pregame news conference, and he was careful to walk toward reporters Sunday after the Wolves' practice. But Finch is making it work, as he did Saturday night when he sat just behind the bench while assistant Micah Nori was the standing coach on the sideline for the Wolves' Game 1 win over the Denver Nuggets.\n\n\"It's a little surreal just being that much separated from the action, if you will. But it was great,\" Finch said. \"I felt like I was in a safe place. I have utmost confidence in our staff and their ability. I thought they did an amazing job. Communicated well. Of course, it was all made better by a really good win. It's our new reality. Just got to find a rhythm.\"\n\nPlayers said there wasn't much of a difference in terms of the communication even though Finch wasn't patrolling the sideline. As forward Kyle Anderson said: \"It worked out better than I thought it would.\"\n\nFinch was still able to make his voice loud and clear, whether on his own or through Nori.\n\n\"It was pretty cool. We still heard Finch. He was still in our ear,\" forward Jaden McDaniels said. \"We were looking at him. It's not like he wasn't out there. Micah does a good job relaying the message and giving us all the confidence. They're basically the same. ... Coach is just sitting down now.\"\n\nSign up for our Timberwolves Update newsletter\n\nFinch said a lot of the calls were still coming from him and assistant Pablo Prigioni as well as Nori, but Nori added that the Wolves don't call a lot of offensive plays.\n\nNori joked after Saturday's game that the play calls that worked came from him and the ones that didn't came from Finch. It seems the two are auditioning for a buddy comedy when speaking about each other in their public comments.\n\n\"We're very much on the same wavelength,\" Finch said. \"We share a brain. If you know Micah, it's not the type of brain you want to share with most people. But we are very much in sync.\"\n\nMcDaniels doesn't let goose egg bother him\n\nOne glance at the boxscore and it would be easy to say McDaniels had a bad game because he didn't score. But upon further review, McDaniels was the Wolves player who made it a hard night on Denver guard Jamal Murray in Game 1, especially late in the fourth quarter after Murray began the quarter with his best scoring stretch of the night.\n\nMcDaniels might have let his offensive frustrations seep into his emotional control in past years, but he said he has learned to move on, especially in the playoffs.\n\n\"It's different. It's the playoffs now,\" McDaniels said. \"It's [a] win-or-go-home type of thing. Just got to affect the game in other ways. We got plenty of scorers, so I'm not tripping. I scored zero, but I still affected the game on defense. That's what I'm here for. Continue doing what I do.\"\n\nMcDaniels said he has a certain strategy he tries to deploy whenever Murray is involved in a pick and roll with Nuggets star big man Nikola Jokic.\n\n\"I just try to not let him reject the screen, and me and Rudy [Gobert] play two-on-two or whoever the big is,\" McDaniels said. \"But the main part is not letting him reject to get to the hand he likes to go.\"\n\nEdwards' technical rescinded\n\nThe NBA rescinded the technical foul Anthony Edwards received in the third quarter for appearing to stare down Nuggets guard Reggie Jackson. The call came after Edwards scored on Jackson with 1 minute, 15 seconds left in the third quarter. The NBA taking the technical away means Edwards has none so far in the playoffs. Players receive a suspension if they get seven technicals in the postseason.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_hine@startribune.com", "name": "Chris Hine", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Finch_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chris Finch (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patellar_tendon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patellar tendon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaden_McDaniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaden McDaniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Anderson_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Anderson (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Prigioni", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pablo Prigioni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(punishment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suspension (punishment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_foul", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Technical foul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pick and roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedy film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://arc.stimg.co/startribunemedia/5HELY2AIIVEFJBTUOACQMRG33Y.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544578", "eventUri": "eng-9544578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 226, "relevance": 1}

There are ramps, steps and scaffolding in the way, and it's something Timberwolves coach Chris Finch is finding out as he coaches this Western Conference second-round series shortly after undergoing patellar tendon surgery in his right knee.\n\nBefore Game 1, Finch climbed up a few steps to take his seat at a pregame news conference, and he was careful to walk toward reporters Sunday after the Wolves' practice. But Finch is making it work, as he did Saturday night when he sat just behind the bench while assistant Micah Nori was the standing coach on the sideline for the Wolves' Game 1 win over the Denver Nuggets.\n\n\"It's a little surreal just being that much separated from the action, if you will. But it was great,\" Finch said. \"I felt like I was in a safe place. I have utmost confidence in our staff and their ability. I thought they did an amazing job. Communicated well. Of course, it was all made better by a really good win. It's our new reality. Just got to find a rhythm.\"\n\nPlayers said there wasn't much of a difference in terms of the communication even though Finch wasn't patrolling the sideline. As forward Kyle Anderson said: \"It worked out better than I thought it would.\"\n\nFinch was still able to make his voice loud and clear, whether on his own or through Nori.\n\n\"It was pretty cool. We still heard Finch. He was still in our ear,\" forward Jaden McDaniels said. \"We were looking at him. It's not like he wasn't out there. Micah does a good job relaying the message and giving us all the confidence. They're basically the same. ... Coach is just sitting down now.\"\n\nSign up for our Timberwolves Update newsletter\n\nFinch said a lot of the calls were still coming from him and assistant Pablo Prigioni as well as Nori, but Nori added that the Wolves don't call a lot of offensive plays.\n\nNori joked after Saturday's game that the play calls that worked came from him and the ones that didn't came from Finch. It seems the two are auditioning for a buddy comedy when speaking about each other in their public comments.\n\n\"We're very much on the same wavelength,\" Finch said. \"We share a brain. If you know Micah, it's not the type of brain you want to share with most people. But we are very much in sync.\"\n\nMcDaniels doesn't let goose egg bother him\n\nOne glance at the boxscore and it would be easy to say McDaniels had a bad game because he didn't score. But upon further review, McDaniels was the Wolves player who made it a hard night on Denver guard Jamal Murray in Game 1, especially late in the fourth quarter after Murray began the quarter with his best scoring stretch of the night.\n\nMcDaniels might have let his offensive frustrations seep into his emotional control in past years, but he said he has learned to move on, especially in the playoffs.\n\n\"It's different. It's the playoffs now,\" McDaniels said. \"It's [a] win-or-go-home type of thing. Just got to affect the game in other ways. We got plenty of scorers, so I'm not tripping. I scored zero, but I still affected the game on defense. That's what I'm here for.

Timberwolves coach stuck behind the bench after serious knee injury", "body": "The Nuggets won just one playoff game against the eventual NBA champions in 2022, only to bounce back and capture a title the next year. Are the Timberwolves on track to follow the same path?\n\nMinnesota won one playoff game in 2023 against the Nuggets, who went on to win the NBA Finals. A year later, the Timberwolves appear much more formidable and might have the inside track to knocking out the defending champions.\n\nHead coach Chris Finch, in his fourth season with the Timberwolves, has done an impressive job of figuring out how to turn the team's trio of big men into a cohesive unit. The Rudy Gobert experiment seemed doomed last season, but Gobert, Karl-Anthony Towns and Naz Reid have become the kind of dominant frontcourt Finch envisioned when the deal was made to acquire the three-time Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nFinch, who was a finalist for Coach of the Year, has his eyes on a championship. He just won't be quite as involved as he was expecting.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Finch and why he's relegated to the back of the bench during Minnesota's playoff run.\n\nMORE: How Anthony Edwards is becoming Michael Jordan 2.0\n\nFinch suffered a significant injury in a collision with Mike Conley near the end of the Timberwolves' series-clinching win over the Suns in the first round.\n\nConley was fouled by Phoenix's Devin Booker while coming up the court with the ball and couldn't regain control until he slammed into his coach along the sideline. Finch remained down for a few minutes and needed help to walk back to the locker room, though he was able to put some weight on his injured leg.\n\nDespite the injury, Finch was in good spirits in the locker room after the game. It would be hard not to be, as the Timberwolves had just closed out their first playoff series win in two decades and the first of Finch's head coaching career.\n\nFinch considered observing the game from a suite or just the locker room to start Minnesota's series against the Nuggets, but the Timberwolves were able to coordinate their bench in a way that allowed him to extend his leg and coach from the second row while assistant coach Micah Nori handled timeouts and other physical duties.\n\nHere's a closer look at Finch's exact injury.\n\nFinch suffered a torn patellar tendon in his knee. He underwent surgery three days after the injury, and the break between the end of the Timberwolves' first-round series and the start of their second-round series allowed him to travel with the team to Denver.\n\nThe 54-year-old told reporters his knee felt \"pretty good, all things considered,\" before Game 1 against the Nuggets, though he had to use crutches to get around.\n\nIt takes about six weeks for a leg to start bearing normal weight after surgery to repair a patellar tendon tear, according to Resilience Orthopedics. The leg must be immobilized in a brace for the first two weeks after surgery, and it will remain in a brace for the following two weeks while able to partially bear weight.\n\nThat means Finch won't be walking around on the sideline any time soon, and likely not at all this season regardless of how deep of a run the Timberwolves make considering the dangers of standing within striking distance of 10 professional athletes moving at full speed.\n\nMORE: Anthony Edwards earns Nikola Jokic's praise after Game 1\n\nNori is Finch's top assistant and is handling the physical responsibilities of the head coaching role while Finch is laid up. That includes calling timeouts and instructing players.\n\nBefore taking over a larger role for the Timberwolves, Nori made a bit of a name for himself with some hilarious in-game interviews. Local broadcasts often interview an assistant coach at halftime, and Nori rarely takes the assignment too seriously.\n\nThe 50-year-old briefly worked with Finch in Denver of all places, as both were assistant coaches under Michael Malone with the Nuggets in 2016-17. Nori, an NBA assistant since 2009, spent time with the Raptors, Kings and Pistons as well, working under Dwane Casey for a stretch in both Toronto and Detroit.\n\nNori joined the Timberwolves as Finch's lead assistant ahead of the 2021-22 season.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Finch_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chris Finch (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naz Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Coach_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Coach of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patellar_tendon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patellar tendon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Conley_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Conley Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Malone_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Malone (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwane_Casey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dwane Casey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-05/GettyImages-2150730375.jpg?itok=_GPp773c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544578", "eventUri": "eng-9544578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

And he just might be taking those final steps in front of a national audience.\n\n\"Yeah, I would say he's pretty much right now,\" Timberwolves head coach Chris Finch said when asked Monday morning if Edwards is playing at a level as high as anyone Finch has coached in his life. \"He's playing certainly at the highest level he's ever played.\"\n\nFinch, lying on a couch in Denver with his leg elevated and wrapped in ice following surgery to repair a torn patellar tendon in his right knee last week, raved to KFXN-FM 100.3's Paul Allen about Edwards making the right plays and staying aggressive, all while opposing defenses put an intense focus on trying to slow him down.\n\n\"When they're committing that much attention we pretty much know what we're going to get and he's just kind of orchestrating. That was always going to be one of the final steps in his growth, Finch said. \"For him to sustain it at this level, with the stakes right now, it's really high-level basketball.\"\n\nAs good as Edwards has been through five playoff games, Jokic is the two-time MVP with a championship belt and Finch believes he remains the best player on the planet.\n\n\"These guys, they're not going to be rattled,\" Finch said of the Nuggets, who trail the best-of-seven series 0-1. \"They still have the best player in the world, in my estimation.

Neal III: The ceiling for these Timberwolves? There isn't one.", "body": "By La Velle E. Neal III, Star Tribune The Tribune Content Agency\n\nMINNEAPOLIS - In the moments following the Timberwolves 106-80 dismantling of the Nuggets on Monday, big man Rudy Gobert FaceTimed an undoubtedly electric locker room.\n\nGobert was back in the Twin Cities enjoying the birth of his first child. The Wolves celebrated Baby Gobert by honoring the defensive anchor with a suffocating, unrelenting, spirit-breaking performance that will propel them in a few days into the Western Conference finals.\n\nAnd likely beyond.\n\nThe Wolves have won all six of their postseason games. They have won all four postseason games they have played on the road.\n\nIt was one thing to sweep the Phoenix Suns, who lacked depth, hated to play defense and whose star player, Devin Booker, delivered a parting gift in Game 4 by hip-checking Mike Conley into head coach Chris Finch, sending him to the operating table.\n\nIt's another to dominate the defending NBA champions through two games in Denver, where the hosts have had no answers. Their head coach, Mike Malone, should have been served a technical for storming the court to yell at an official. Their point guard, Jamal Murray, should be fined for hurling a heat pack onto the floor in frustration during play.\n\nWhile this was going on, Gobert was at home. And Finch is unable to walk the sideline following knee surgery. It hasn't mattered. The Wolves moved Kyle Anderson into the starting lineup. Assistant coach Micah Nori played the Finch role to aplomb. And they kept charging.\n\nBased on what has transpired, Gobert can go on paternity leave until the conference finals. They got this.\n\n\"It's a really fun group of guys to be around at this time,\" Nori said during an appearance on KFAN on Tuesday. \"We're winning basketball games and it makes it that much more fun.\"\n\nThe Wolves landed in the Twin Cities around 4 a.m. Tuesday in the midst of a postseason rampage. Teams are supposed to play their best ball at this time of year. The Wolves not only are doing that, they are raising the bar. And the expectations follow.\n\nThere are no signs it will let up. This team smells blood in the water now, just like they did when they were up 2-0 on the Suns.\n\nAfter taking that 2-0 lead against Phoenix, fans chanted \"Wolves in four!\" After perhaps the best defensive performance in club history on Monday, visiting fans chanted \"Wolves in four!\" once again. And the home fans at high altitude could do nothing about it.\n\nIt is perfectly reasonable to speculate where this is headed. A postseason that could end with the Larry O'Brien Trophy parked at 600 N. 1st Ave. A title built on defense, which isn't supposed to exist in today's game. A team with a high-flying superstar in Anthony Edwards, who doesn't like comparisons to the incomparable Michael Jordan. But he then shrugged his shoulders after swishing a 3-pointer in the third quarter Monday like Jordan did in the 1992 Finals against Portland.\n\nThis looks real. They even forced TNT's Charles Barkley, who spent most of the season asserting that the two-big-man system won't work in the playoffs, to evacuate from that hill.\n\nThis series is over. That will be confirmed on Friday, then Sunday, at Target Center. Murray is shooting one-legged jumpers because of a sore right calf. Superstar Nikola Jokic was limited by an array of Wolves defenders in Game 1 and great work by a defensively focused Karl-Anthony Towns in Game 2. After Aaron Gordon, Denver's offensive options are limited beyond their top three. Defensively, they can't double-team Towns and Edwards simultaneously, and the pair have taken turns exploiting that.\n\nThere will not be a repeat champion in the NBA this year.\n\nI was in Las Vegas for the Vikings-Raiders game on Dec. 10 when coach Kevin O'Connell told the team they had a championship defense following a 3-0 victory. The real championship defense is being played on the other side of downtown, as the Wolves have put themselves out front in the chase for Mr. O'Brien's trophy.", "source": {"uri": "bnd.com",

The three-step climb to get to it is light work for most NBA players and coaches who sit behind the microphone. But for Minnesota Timberwolves coach Chris Finch, it must feel like scaling a mountain.\n\nTo get there, Finch first has to hand his crutches to a member of the Timberwolves PR staff. He then grimaces as he puts most of his body weight on the handrails to pull himself up to the table. Getting down can be even trickier as he looks to avoid putting too much strain on a heavily braced right knee that exploded at the end of the first round after a collision with Mike Conley.\n\nTalk to anyone who has ruptured a patellar tendon, and the first thing that comes up is the searing pain that radiates through the affected leg, both before and after surgery. It is a traumatic injury that generally calls for patients to keep their leg elevated and immobilized for a stretch after it is repaired to aid healing and reduce the pain. Finch was back at practice, crutching around the court, the next day and on a flight to Denver to join his Timberwolves for Game 1 two days after he was cut open.\n\nHe has told those around him that he is in near-constant pain, his face unable to hide it no matter how hard he tries. And yet there he was in Denver, refusing to stay behind as his team opened its second-round series against the defending champions. His players and coaches were going there to fight, letting the rest of the NBA know that these aren't the same hapless Wolves that have been so easy to overlook for most of their 35 years in the league. So that meant Finch was going to fight, too.\n\n\"He's a warrior,\" said assistant coach Micah Nori, who has filled in as the coach patrolling the sideline while Finch watched from the second row to protect his knee.\n\nThe team is emulating that grit in these playoffs. After a 1o6-80 wipeout of the Nuggets in Game 2, they improved to 6-0 in the postseason. They will come home for Games 3 and 4 on Friday and Sunday with a real chance to complete their second straight sweep. The overriding theme during this early ride has been lock-jawed defense and take-no-prisoners toughness. It was too much for the Phoenix Suns in the first round. It has been too much for the defending champions, who are down 2-0, in the Western Conference semifinals.\n\nThree and a half years ago, Finch came to a shaken organization that had lost its will to compete. They were 7-24 when he took over in the middle of the 2020-21 season, and thousand-yard stares greeted him as he arrived after a controversial hiring process.\n\nIn that time, Finch has built a coalition of support from across the organization. The primary drivers of his high approval rating include an even-keeled demeanor, his open-door policy with players and a savvy feel for the political aspects of the job that include working with the media and fostering connections with ownership and the business side of the operations.\n\nHe is not a fiery quote machine like Denver's Michael Malone. He doesn't pontificate the way Golden State's Steve Kerr does. He has not yet accomplished enough in his head coaching career to exhibit the gravitas of Gregg Popovich or Erik Spoelstra. He has never been a softie, but the seriousness of his focus has often been shrouded by a genial effect. Underneath the unassuming public persona burns a competitive fire that has changed everything for these Timberwolves.\n\nThe more we win, the more I want to win.\n\nIt is a mantra for Finch and it is revealing itself more in this series than it ever has. No one in their right mind would have hopped a plane to Denver two days after major surgery and eschewed a scooter or some sort of wheeled transportation around the cavernous Ball Arena in favor of walking gingerly with a crutch under each arm.\n\nAs erudite as Finch can present when talking about basketball and life, the macho athlete is still inside of him. The one that once, according to legend at his NCAA Division III college in his native Pennsylvania, picked a teammate up off the ground in the halftime locker room while he challenged him to catch the ball when Finch passed it his way.\n\nEvery NBA coach has a little crazy in them. That's what it takes to climb the ranks, deal with the egos, manage their own and sit on a seat that can get hot with any losing streak. It is part of what kept Finch going when he was coaching basketball neophytes in England or drawing up plays on whiteboards for his team while it was stuck in traffic in Belgium. It is what kept him grinding for 10 years as an NBA assistant while getting turned down over and over again for head jobs until the Wolves finally came through.\n\nIt's what pushed him to go to Denver with his team. They have\u2009 come too far for him to let this pain get in the way of their pursuit of a championship. It is not that he doesn't trust his assistants to handle the job in his absence. To the contrary, Finch empowers his staff as much as any coach in the league, which is why the Wolves haven't missed a beat against the Nuggets.\n\nThis was more about sending a message to his players. He wasn't going to leave them in the middle of a fight.\n\n\"I can imagine the doctor told him not to travel and not fly, and Finchy said, 'Hell no, I'm gonna be there for my team,'\u2009\" Karl-Anthony Towns said. \"So the leader of our team, when you have someone who is willing to fight like that, of course, his troops are willing to fight just as hard.\"\n\nFinch has pushed these Wolves to shed the failings of the past and reinvent themselves. He has asked them to sacrifice for each other, to prioritize defensive rotations in the age of @BallIsLife highlight packages, to play back-to-backs when others would rest. When you ask so much of those playing, you better offer as much to them in return.\n\n\"If he's going to tell us to play through injuries and stuff like that, he better damn well be on that bench,\" Conley said with a smile. \"So he's doing a great job.\"\n\nThat's what Finch did in Denver. He was there in the heat of the battle with them, motioning to Anthony Edwards for counsel in the closing moments of Game 1, challenging the bench players to be better at halftime and pushing them to keep their foot on the gas as they blew the Nuggets out in Game 2.\n\nHe came to Minnesota with the reputation of being an offensive innovator, conjuring visions of a wide-open, free-flowing, high-scoring attack centered around Towns, Edwards and, at the time, D'Angelo Russell. But in short order, he and president of basketball operations Tim Connelly have remade the team's roster and its psyche. One-way players like Russell and Jaylen Nowell are out. Conley, Rudy Gobert and Nickeil Alexander-Walker are in. Defense over offense. Fists over flash.\n\nA team long criticized for being soft is as tough as they come right now. They have taken a sledgehammer to the defending champions in their second-round series, embodying the mindset of their wounded head coach.\n\nThe players see how much this hurts him, which underscores how badly he wants it. The Timberwolves have been the hungrier team in the first two games against the Nuggets, which appear to be shocked by the intensity and ferocity that Minnesota is bringing. Denver is playing like a team with nothing left to prove after winning the title last year.\n\nThe Wolves are playing like a team with everything to gain as they look to put years of losing behind them. Their coach wants it as badly as any of them.\n\n\"He hops over on the crutches at times when he's yelling at guys behind the bench,\" Conley said. \"That passion he has for the game, it's rubbing off on other guys. We're doing a great job of keeping him involved, keeping him engaged and he's doing a great job keeping on us and just being who he is.\"\n\nThe layout of Ball Arena is such that the walk from the visitor's locker room to the postgame news conference room is a long one. Finch elected to have Nori make that walk after Game 1. But after watching his team smash the Nuggets in Game 2, the head coach decided to make the trek himself.\n\n\"A lot of adrenaline surging through my body right now,\" Finch said. \"See what tomorrow brings. They've been great. Everybody's been great.\"\n\nMoments later, Finch got up from his seat and carefully stepped off of the dais to head to the team bus and a return flight home. Games 3 and 4 await this weekend in Minnesota. The champs are on the ropes but by no means knocked out. His team has a championship gleam in their eyes, but are still only halfway through Round 2.\n\nThe climb is only just beginning.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Despite not having a home-court advantage against the defending champions Denver Nuggets, the Wolves have taken a commanding 2-0 lead in the series, which is headed to Minnesota.\n\nThe talk of the town is Timberwolves All-Star guard Anthony Edwards, who has dominated the series with his Jordanesque performances in Games 1 and 2. But if you look at it closely, Minnesota has beaten Denver using the formula that worked so well for them during the regular season - defense.\n\nTimberwolves head coach Chris Finch appeared on the recent edition of the Dan Patrick Show and discussed how his team has dominated the defending champions.\n\n\"I think familiarity is really big here. We know them well. We played them well over the last few years. There's a lot of confidence going into the series about how we can handle them. Our size, for sure, is a factor. I mean, we're long - not just the two bigs, but you know, Jaden McDaniels, Kyle Anderson, Naz Reid. These are three more 6-10 guys that we can put on the floor, and not many teams have that,\" he said.\n\nThe Defensive transformation\n\nThe Wolves got long by going against the grain in 2022. With an elite center in KAT already on board, Minnesota traded for Rudy Gobert in a heavily criticized trade. However, Finch said that the move was by design because they wanted to be different.\n\n\"You're not going to out small ball the best in the business at that time which was Golden State. So how can you be different and can be good enough being different?\" added the Wolves' head coach.\n\nBy adding Gobert to a team with several long and good individual defenders, Finch said they decided to make defense their calling card this season. It worked wonders, as Minnesota won 56 games this season, its most since its 58-win season in 2004. Also, the Wolves finished the regular season as the No.1 Defensive Team in the NBA.\n\nWolves have suffocated the Nuggets\n\nThe Timberwolves have suffocated the Mile High squad through two games with their size, depth, and defense. Nikola Jokic committed 7 turnovers in Game 1 and shot just 5-13 with four turnovers in Game 2. Jamal Murray is 9-32 and averaging 12.5 PPG in two games. Michael Porter Jr. was held to 9 points on 4-12 shooting in Game 2. The result? A 2-0 series lead for the Wolves with Games 3 and 4 to be played on their home floor.\n\n\"I think you know just some familiarity, some size, and they the willingness to kind of battle then and try to wear them down as best as we can. We feel we have a pretty deep team and we just can keep coming in waves,\" concluded Finch.\n\nThe series is far from over. But when you look at history, only 33 out of 454 teams down 0-2 in the NBA playoffs have come back to win the series. Unless the Lakers' Daddy Mike Malone finds a way to solve the Minnesota riddle, the Joker will be home with his horses sooner than they were expecting him back.\n\nRelated: \"Rudy, KAT, and Naz ain't no joke\" - Kevin Garnett discusses how the Timberwolves are wearing out Jokic", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shane_garry_acedera@postandcourier.com", "name": "Shane Garry Acedera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Finch_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chris Finch (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naz Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaden_McDaniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaden McDaniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Anderson_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Anderson (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Malone_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Malone (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Garnett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Garnett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Porter_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Porter Jr."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/02/902eb0eb-2f14-5d29-b2c4-d59c30646f98/663c842e70fd1.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C22&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544578", "eventUri": "eng-9544578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Morris played five years in Denver, and four-time defensive player of the year Rudy Gobert is the anchor of Minnesota's defense.\n\nSize gave the Nuggets an advantage, but continuity turned them into champions. Connelly may have stolen the Death Star plans on his way out of Denver, but the Wolves still needed to attack the exhaust port. Minnesota used Gobert as a roamer against Nikola Jokic and the Nuggets in Game 1.\n\nBut on Monday, everyone was on FlightAware, wondering if Gobert would return to Denver for Game 2 after his fianc\u00e9e gave birth to their first child. Finch announced that Gobert would miss the game a couple hours before tip. Vegas favored the Nuggets by 5.5 points, and some people thought Denver would win the game in the first quarter.\n\nInstead, the Wolves won the first quarter 28-20 and took a 36-20 lead with 9:22 to go in the second. Malone called a timeout to stymie Minnesota's momentum but couldn't ward off its relentless defensive attack. Sans Gobert, the Timberwolves tossed Karl-Anthony Towns, Naz Reid, and Kyle Anderson at Jokic. Jaden McDaniels and Nickeil Alexander-Walker locked down Jamal Murray. The Wolves never relinquished the lead and won 106-80.\n\n\"Rudy's driven the defensive culture here,\" Finch said after Game 2. \"It's a testament to his impact, his presence, and what he's infused into the team. [It shows] how important defense is and how great we can be when we play it. That aside, we've always expected to win no matter who is with us.\"\n\nConnelly built a deep, malleable roster, filling the bench full of players with skillsets similar to those of the starters. Morris takes care of the ball and plays defense, complementing Mike Conley; Alexander-Walker hounds players defensively like McDaniels. Reid is a big who stretches the floor like Towns. No bench player can replicate Edwards' scoring or Gobert's defense, but Anderson is a large playmaker who's crafty defensively.\n\nMinnesota's depth has allowed it to weather adversity throughout the year. Towns missed 18 games with a knee injury. Still, the Timberwolves were first in the Western Conference for most of the season. Edwards only had 15 points in Game 2 against the Phoenix Suns, and the Wolves won 105-93. Gobert missed Monday's game, and the Wolves blew out the defending champs on their home floor.\n\nConnelly has built a winner and locked in most of Minnesota's core long-term.\n\nThe Timberwolves have Morris and Anderson's Bird Rights. Therefore, Alexander-Walker (two years, $9 million) is the only player in Minnesota's rotation who isn't under team control in 2026. \"Everybody's here to win,\" Reid said in November. \"Everybody has one goal. Everybody's got their money situation out of the way. Now we're here to play basketball and win the game. We're not really worried too much about anything other than that.\"\n\nMinnesota withstood turbulence in Denver. They snuffed out the defending champs before a raucous crowd and drowned out the outside noise. Glen Taylor is in arbitration with Alex Rodriguez and Marc Lore to determine who owns the team. Chris Finch is coaching through a knee injury. Current and former players were critical of Gobert for missing Game 2. At least for one weekend, it didn't matter. Connelly built the Timberwolves to withstand adversity. They are legion and ready to take down the NBA's Death Star.", "source": {"uri": "zonecoverage.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zone Coverage"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_schreier@zonecoverage.com", "name": "Tom Schreier", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moses Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Finch_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chris Finch (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Connelly", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tim Connelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Adelman_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Adelman (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ball Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Saunders", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Saunders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont\u00e9_Morris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mont\u00e9 Morris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Malone_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Malone (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naz Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaden_McDaniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaden McDaniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickeil_Alexander-Walker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nickeil Alexander-Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Anderson_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Anderson (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glen Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Conley_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Conley Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Rodriguez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Rodriguez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/zonecoverage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/USATSI_23208562_168390100_lowres.jpg?fit=1909%2C1273&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544578", "eventUri": "eng-9544578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Karl-Anthony Towns and Anthony Edwards outscored the Nuggets by themselves 36-35 in the first half. The Wolves frustrated Denver star Jamal Murray enough he was fined $100,000 by the league for throwing a heat pack and towel on the court during a 3-for-18 shooting night.\n\nThe Wolves did it all without now four-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert at home in Minnesota cradling his newborn son Romeo while he watched them play on.\n\nJust how did they do it?\n\n\"I wish I knew,\" Wolves veteran point guard Mike Conley said. \"The absence of Rudy put a little bit more pressure on everybody. You didn't want to be that guy. You didn't want to be that guy not giving the effort. You didn't want to be that guy not in the right spot, not communicating because we knew we didn't have Rudy back there to save us from something happening. So the team just collectively got together, saw the effort going on out there and put on a show.\n\n\"Like for real. I hadn't seen us play that hard and that aggressive and that connected in a long time.\"\n\nVeteran forward Kyle Anderson took Gobert's place in Monday's starting five, starting out guarding three-time league MVP Nikola Jokic, who shot 5-for-13 himself.\n\nAnderson was asked what he and his teammates did differently that night.\n\n\"That's y'all job to say,\" Anderson told reporters. \"Just different personnel. I don't want to say we made adjustment, but maybe just a little different edge out there. You got Rudy the rim protector when he's out there. This time we had to keep guys in front and be scrappy and swarm and compete and rotate.\n\n\"So just a little different energy out there.\"\n\nGobert held his baby and watched from afar while his teammates demonstrated the defensive culture Wolves coach Chris Finch said Gobert has given the team all by himself.\n\n\"It was incredible,\" Gobert said Wednesday. \"Obviously I was watching the game, holding the baby at the same time. But I had a little emotion at the because it like was something special. The energy, the focus that they had, the determination. I don't know, there was something special in the way they came out. They came out to play 48 minutes. It was an incredible day, an incredible way to end the day for me and obviously the whole organization.\"\n\nGobert spoke at a Wednesday morning news conference promoting the Defensive Player of the Year award he won for a record-tying fourth time, all his name alongside Dikembe Mutombo and Ben Wallace. TNT announced him the winner in Tuesday night's playoff broadcast.\n\nThe Wolves' Game 2 victory in the Western Conference semifinals kept them perfect in the playoffs, at 6-0 after they swept Phoenix 4-0 in the first round. Four of those are consecutive road victories.\n\nThe best-of-seven series comes to Target Center Friday and Sunday for Games 3 and 4.\n\nThe Wolves seek a Game 2 repeat, or anything close to it defensively.\n\n\"It's like offense, it just feeds itself,\" Finch said. \"After a while, we've gotten in a good rhythm. Point of attack [defense] was really good. Interruption was really good. Rebounding was really good. Like Nickeil [Alexander-Walker] said in his post-game, you felt like we were in a defensive zone. You don't hear that much, but it's the mindset of any great athlete. You want to get in that zone where things feel automatic to you.\n\n\"The hard part about defense is it takes a lot of work and you have to do it every single time.\"", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jerry_zgoda@startribune.com", "name": "Jerry Zgoda", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Anderson_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Anderson (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Conley_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Conley Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Wallace_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Wallace (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickeil_Alexander-Walker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nickeil Alexander-Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Finch_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Finch (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dikembe_Mutombo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dikembe Mutombo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Center", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Target Center"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoff_format", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoff format"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://arc.stimg.co/startribunemedia/ZTOAP6RRWFFCJL3EXBFJOEPEE4.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544578", "eventUri": "eng-9544578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Denver is done.", "body": "The Wolves will put Denver away soon. And it's hard to find any reason to pump the brakes with this bunch.\n\nIn the moments following the Timberwolves 106-80 dismantling of the Nuggets on Monday, big man Rudy Gobert Facetimed an undoubtedly electric locker room.\n\nGobert was back in the Twin Cities enjoying the birth of his first child. The Wolves celebrated Baby Gobert by honoring the defensive anchor with a suffocating, unrelenting, spirit-breaking performance that will propel them in a few days into the Western Conference finals.\n\nAnd likely beyond.\n\nThe Wolves have won all six of their postseason games. They have won all four postseason games they have played on the road.\n\nIt was one thing to sweep the Phoenix Suns, who lacked depth, hated to play defense and whose star player, Devin Booker, delivered a parting gift in Game 4 by hip-checking Mike Conleyinto head coach Chris Finch, sending him to the operating table.\n\nIt's another to dominate the defending NBA champions through two games in Denver, where the hosts have had no answers. Their head coach, Mike Malone, should have been served a technical for storming the court to yell at an official. Their point guard, Jamal Murray, should be fined for hurling a heat pack onto the floor in frustration during play.\n\nWhile this was going on, Gobert was at home. And Finch is unable to walk the sideline following knee surgery. It hasn't mattered. The Wolves moved Kyle Anderson into the starting lineup. Assistant coach Micah Nori played the Finch role to aplomb. And they kept charging.\n\nBased on what has transpired, Gobert can go on paternity leave until the conference finals. They got this.\n\n\"It's a really fun group of guys to be around at this time,\" Nori said during an appearance on KFAN on Tuesday. \"We're winning basketball games and it makes it that much more fun.\"\n\nThe Wolves landed in the Twin Cities around 4 a.m. Tuesday in the midst of a postseason rampage. Teams are supposed to play their best ball at this time of year. The Wolves not only are doing that, they are raising the bar. And the expectations follow.\n\nThere are no signs it will let up. This team smells blood in the water now, just like they did when they were up 2-0 on the Suns.\n\nAfter taking that 2-0 lead against Phoenix, fans chanted \"Wolves in four!\" After perhaps the best defensive performance in club history on Monday, visiting fans chanted \"Wolves in four!\" once again. And the home fans at high altitude could to nothing about it.\n\nIt is perfectly reasonable to speculate where this is headed. A postseason that could end with the Larry O'Brien Trophy parked at 600 N. 1st Ave. A title built on defense, which isn't supposed to exist in today's game. A team with a high-flying superstar in Antony Edwards, who doesn't like comparisons to the incomparable Michael Jordan. But he then shrugged his shoulders after swishing a three-pointer in the third quarter Monday like Jordan did in the 1992 finals against Portland.\n\nThis looks real. They even forced TNT's Charles Barkley, who spent most of the season asserting that the two-big-man system won't work in the playoffs, to evacuate from that hill.\n\nThis series is over. That will be confirmed on Friday, then Sunday, at Target Center. Murray is shooting one-legged jumpers because of a sore right calf. Superstar Nikola Jokic was limited by an array of Wolves defenders in Game 1 and great work by a defensively focused Karl-Anthony Towns in Game 2. After Aaron Gordon, Denver's offensive options are limited beyond their top three. Defensively, they can't double-team Towns and Edwards simultaneously, and the pair have taken turns exploiting that.\n\nThere will not be a repeat champion in the NBA this year.\n\nI was in Las Vegas for the Vikings-Raiders game on Dec. 10 when coach Kevin O'Connell told the team they had a championship defense following a 3-0 victory. The real championship defense is being played on the other side of downtown, as the Wolves have put themselves out front in the chase for Mr. O'Brien's trophy.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com",

But he also felt a dad's satisfaction as his teammates harassed and frustrated the Nuggets with one of the finest defensive performances in NBA playoff history.\n\nAh, kids. They grow up so fast.\n\n\"I had a little bit of emotion at the end because it felt like it was something special,\" Gobert said.\n\nThe defense the Wolves put on display, the first half in particular, was breathtakingly relentless and ruthless. They swarmed the Nuggets as if the game was being played eight-on-five.\n\nThey attacked like Mike Tyson in his prime bolting from his corner at opening bell. The Wolves finished with 12 blocks and 11 steals while forcing 16 turnovers.\n\nThe Nuggets looked panicked. They whined to officials. Their body language screamed, \"Help!\"\n\nIt was a masterclass that had legends of the game gushing.\n\n\"This is one of the best defensive teams I've ever seen. Ever,\" Charles Barkley said on TNT.\n\n\"This is the defensive version of what the Warriors did for offense when the league wasn't ready! Defense that sells tickets!?\" Kevin Garnett wrote on X about his former team.\n\nSports long ago became obsessed with offense. Three-pointers and dunks in basketball, home runs in baseball, touchdowns in football.\n\nHighlights packages almost always begin with offense.\n\nThe Wolves make defense look sexy. Their ability to smother shooters and squeeze offenses like a boa constrictor trapping its prey is just as compelling as what happens when they have the ball.\n\nSure, nothing puts a charge into the arena quite like Anthony Edwards soaring for a dunk. But watching all five players on the court move and flow on defense as if connected by a string is a thing of beauty.\n\n\"Intentional\" is a new buzzword in corporate America. The Wolves are intentional about being pests on defense.\n\n\"The hard part about defense is that it takes a lot of work and you've got to do it every single time down,\" coach Chris Finch said.\n\nThe Wolves took an oath to do that. Gathered as a group on the first day of training camp, the players asked themselves a question: Who do we want to be?\n\n\"Everyone said we want to be a defensive team,\" Gobert said. \"We said, 'OK, we're going to hold ourselves accountable and do that every day.'\"\n\nFinch noted that the addition of Gobert alone last year gave the team a chance to become a top-five defense. Gobert's defensive brilliance was rightfully recognized this week with his fourth NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award.\n\nHe is the anchor who makes everyone around him better defenders. But one man alone doesn't account for the Wolves transforming into the league's best defensive team. That takes total buy-in from every player, all committed to the cause, all willing to commit as much effort and focus to defense as anything else.\n\nBasketball teams often talk about their chemistry on the court. Normally, the first assumption is to think about offense and the byproduct of five guys working together in a free-flowing system that keeps everyone involved in the action.\n\nThe Wolves are demonstrating what tight chemistry on defense looks like. Individually, they are tenacious. Collectively, they have each other's backs.\n\nThey rotate to help one another. They communicate when opponents try to create mismatches. They swarm when a ballhandler is in trouble.\n\n\"Chemistry starts from watching everybody put the same amount of effort in,\" Finch said.\n\nNobody shirks that standard. Finch doesn't have to worry about hiding players on defense to avoid being exploited. The Wolves not only make opponents uncomfortable with their size and Go-Go Gadget arms, their perimeter defenders treat their assignment like gum stuck to the bottom of a shoe.\n\nFun fact: the Wolves rank second among playoff teams in scoring, which might come as a little bit of a surprise. It's easy to overlook that part because what we are witnessing with their defense is special.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Center", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Target Center"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis\u2013Saint_Paul", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Finch_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Finch (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boa_constrictor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boa constrictor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Garnett", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Garnett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Defensive_Player_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Defensive Player of the Year Award"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://arc.stimg.co/startribunemedia/ZEW2GBMNUFGK7KOY4LHWMAOXK4.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544578", "eventUri": "eng-9544578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

The Nuggets were held to a season-low 80 points, shooting just 34.9% as a team while committing 16 turnovers.\n\n\"Their energy that they put in, their focus that they had, the determination,\" Gobert continued. \"I don't know, there was something special with the way they came out. And not just the way they came out, the way they played for 48 minutes that night. It was an incredible day. It was incredible way to end the day for me and obviously for the whole.\"\n\nGobert garnered 72 first-place votes for the award, 24 second-place votes and one third-place vote in running away from the rest of the field. San Antonio Spurs rookie Victor Wembanyama came in second (19 first-place votes) and Miami Heat big man Bam Adebayo game in third (three first-place votes).\n\nThe Wolves, with Gobert anchoring the middle, led the NBA in defensive rating this season, allowing 108.4 points per 100 possessions -- 2.2. fewer than the Boston Celtics, who ranked second.\n\n\"These awards don't go to teams that are struggling,\" Wolves president Tim Connelly said Wednesday. \"So beyond the well-deserved recognition, I think it's recognition of the success our team is having and hopefully will continue to have.\"\n\nMinnesota coach Chris Finch, who credited Gobert's success this season to his commitment over the summer in developing deeper bonds with members of the organization after Gobert's first season with the franchise ended with a first round exit against Denver, said Game 2 was a product of his team finding a defensive flow together.\n\n\"It's like offense, it just feeds itself after a while,\" Finch said after practice Wednesday. \"We got in a rhythm. Point-of-attack was really good; disruption was really good; rebounding was really good. And once we realized that we were able to kind of benefit from it, it kind of just fed itself. ... The hard part about defense is it takes a lot of work and you have to do it every time down, so we have to be ready for Friday.\"\n\nThe Wolves host the Nuggets in Game 3 on Friday (8:30 p.m. ET, ESPN). Adding to the juice of a Target Center crowd enjoying its first second-round playoff game in 20 years will be moment when Gobert receives the Hakeem Olajuwon Trophy for winning Defensive Player of the Year.\n\n\"Our fans are going to be rowdy and you got Rudy's presentation before the game, right? So that's going be special,\" Wolves forward Kyle Anderson said. \"It's a big game for us. It's almost a must win. We got to go out there and compete. I can't wait to go out and be in front of our fans.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Wallace_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Wallace (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Wembanyama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victor Wembanyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Finch_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Finch (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dikembe_Mutombo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dikembe Mutombo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bam_Adebayo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bam Adebayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Anderson_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Anderson (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Connelly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Connelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Olajuwon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Olajuwon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Center", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Target Center"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0504%2Fr1328574_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544578", "eventUri": "eng-9544578", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

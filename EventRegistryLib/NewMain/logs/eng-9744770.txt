And they all are in the news because of a massive controversy.\n\nTiming with the Paris Olympics, Adidas came out with an ad campaign to relaunch the classic SL72 sneakers from the 1972 Olympic Games.\n\nThe point of controversy: it picked a half-Palestinian model, Bella Hadid, who's also a vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause.\n\nWhat makes American supermodel Bella Hadid a problematic choice for the sneaker ad campaign is the bloody history of the Munich Games.\n\nIn 1972, 12 Israelis were killed in the Munich Olympics. This bloodshed, as the whole world was watching the Olympics, happened as a Palestinian terrorist group -- Black September -- took the Israelis hostage and killed them.\n\nIsraelis and American Jews were up in arms. Even the Israeli government's official X handle protested against the ad. Adidas apologised for the ad campaign and said it would revisit it.\n\nThis is how things went wrong.\n\nThe SL72 campaign is the revival of the \"coveted classic\" sneakers from the 70s.\n\nAdidas is facing a backlash about its ad campaign as it coincides with the 52nd anniversary of the Munich Games where 12 Israeli coaches and athletes were killed by Palestinian terrorists.\n\nMembers of the Black September group had entered the Olympic Village and taken these Israelis as hostages, and then they were killed.\n\nThe advertisement for SL72 features Bella Hadid, who is seen holding flowers and flaunting a pair of sneakers. \"Giving Bella Hadid her flowers in the SL 72,\" read a tweet from Adidas. Soccer player Jules Kounde, rapper A$AP Nast, musician Melissa Bon and model Sabrina Lan are featured in the campaign.\n\nBella Hadid's father, Mohammed Hadid, is a Palestinian immigrant to the US. Bella Hadid and her father have been criticised by pro-Israeli groups for their support for Gaza in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nHadid calls herself a \"proud Palestinian\". She has been vocal in her support for Palestine in the war. She had even marched against then President Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\n\nDue to her clear support for Palestine and her origin, and the choice of sneakers from the Munich Olympics, the Israeli government's official handle spoke up against the campaign.\n\n\"Adidas recently launched a new campaign for their shoes to highlight the 1972 Munich Olympics. Eleven Israelis were murdered by Palestinian terrorists during the Munich Olympics. Guess who the face of their campaign is? Bella Hadid, a half-Palestinian model who has a history of spreading antisemitism and calling for violence against Israelis and Jews. She and her father frequently promote blood libels and antisemitic conspiracies against Jews,\" tweeted the State of Israel's official X handle.\n\nThe American Jewish Committee also tweeted against the Adidas campaign.\n\n\"At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, 12 Israelis were murdered and taken hostage by the Palestinian terrorist group Black September. For Adidas to pick a vocal anti-Israel model to recall this dark Olympics is either a massive oversight or intentionally inflammatory. Neither is acceptable. We call on Adidas to address this egregious error,\" the American Jewish Committee said in a statement.\n\nAdidas had to apologise and even remove all tweets featuring Hadid from their X and Instagram handles.\n\n\"We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events -- though these are completely unintentional -- and we apologise for any upset or distress caused,\" Adidas said in a statement to USA Today.\n\nAdidas plans to revise its campaign.\n\n\"As a result, we are revising the remainder of the campaign.

She and her sister Gigi Hadid have together donated $1 million to support multiple Palestinian relief efforts in Gaza, including HEAL Palestine, Palestine Children's Relief Fund, World Central Kitchen, and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).\n\nHadid has occasionally shared misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war and received criticism for sharing social media posts downplaying the experiences of the Israelis held hostage in Gaza.\n\nAt the 1972 Munich Olympics, eight members of the Palestinian terror group Black September broke into the Israeli Olympic team's residence, immediately killing one coach and one member of the weightlifting team, and took nine more Israeli team members hostage. All were killed during a botched rescue operation, as was a West German police officer.\n\nThe massacre was commemorated at the Olympics for the first time at the 2020 Games, held in 2021.

Nine Israeli hostages were killed, as well as five Palestinians and one German policeman.\n\nThe 27-year-old model, who is the daughter of Dutch model Yolanda Hadid and Palestinian real estate developer Mohamed Hadid, has been vocal about her support for Palestine amid the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nIn response to the backlash, Adidas issued a statement announcing that it will be \"revising\" its campaign with Hadid. \"We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events - though these are completely unintentional - and we apologize for any upset or distress caused,\" Adidas said in a statement to USA Today on Thursday.\n\n\"As a result, we are revising the remainder of the campaign. We believe in sport as a unifying force around the world and will continue our efforts to champion diversity and equality in everything we do,\" the company said.\n\nThe athletic brand's campaign for the SL72 sneaker featured Hadid wearing a white T-shirt with the brand's signature black stripes while holding up the newly-launched sneakers. Another photo showed the model holding flowers, as the X account for Adidas Originals wrote in the caption: \"Giving Bella Hadid her flowers in the SL72.\"\n\nHadid also took to Instagram last week to share photos of the Adidas billboard campaign displayed in Times Square, Manhattan. While her post remains on her Instagram account as of Friday, Adidas has deleted all photos featuring Hadid from its social media pages.\n\nThe campaign controversy comes weeks after the model paid homage to her Palestinian roots by wearing a red and white Keffiyeh dress to the Cannes Film Festival in May. The traditional garment has been central to Palestinian culture for centuries, becoming a prominent symbol of nationalism around the time of the creation of the state of Israel in the 1940s. The scarf has also been used as a symbol of pro-Palestine support throughout Israel's ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nDespite the backlash, the model has maintained that being vocal about her pro-Palestine beliefs is her priority over her modeling career. While appearing on the Rep podcast in August 2022, Hadid revealed that she has lost modeling opportunities because of her views. \"I had so many companies stop working with me,\" Hadid said. \"I had friends that completely dropped me, like even friends that I had been having dinner with at their home on Friday nights for seven years, like now just won't let me at their house any more.\"\n\nHowever, Hadid later said in an interview with GQ that she is unwilling to compromise her beliefs for her career.\n\n\"I realized that I'm not on this earth to be a model,\" she explained. \"I'm so lucky and blessed that I'm in a position where I can speak out the way that I do. And really, the downfall is what? That I lose my job?\"\n\nThe Independent has contacted representatives for Adidas and Hadid for comment.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Munich massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Black September Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jewish_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Jewish Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Hadid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bella Hadid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Hadid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Hadid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yolanda_Hadid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yolanda Hadid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keffiyeh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keffiyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Square", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Times Square"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cannes Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/19/17/newFile.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744770", "eventUri": "eng-9744770", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 459, "textEnd": 466}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

Palestinian terrorists, representing the militant group \"Black September,\" killed 11 members of Israel's Olympic team after taking them hostage.\n\nFor 34 hours, the Olympic Games were suspended, and a mass was held in the main stadium to pay tribute to the victims.\n\nBella is a Palestinian-American model, and her father was a Palestinian immigrant. She has been critical of Israel amid the ongoing war between Hamas and the Israeli Defense Forces. She has also offered support to relief efforts for Palestinians in Gaza.

Bella Hadid, a half-Palestinian model who has a history of spreading antisemitism and calling for violence against Israelis and Jews. She and her father frequently promote blood libels and antisemitic conspiracies against Jews.\"\n\nThe American Jewish Committee also condemned the Adidas campaign on X, calling it an \"egregious error.\"\n\n\"For Adidas to pick a vocal anti-Israel model to recall this dark Olympics is either a massive oversight or intentionally inflammatory,\" the AJC wrote. \"Neither is acceptable.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Adidas told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that the company would be \"revising\" the campaign for the shoe, called Adidas Originals SL72, in response to the criticism, although it did not specify how. The shoe is a replica of a style worn by athletes at the 1972 games.\n\n\"The Adidas Originals SL72 campaign unites a broad range of partners to celebrate our lightweight running shoe, designed more than 50 years ago and worn in sport and culture around the world,\" the spokesperson said. \"We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events -- though these are completely unintentional -- and we apologize for any upset or distress caused. As a result we are revising the remainder of the campaign. We believe in sport as a unifying force around the world and will continue our efforts to champion diversity and equality in everything we do.\"\n\nHadid was among five celebrities, models, and athletes hired as models for the new SL 72 campaign.\n\nThe revision marks yet another instance where the German-based athletic apparel company has faced public scrutiny over its representatives and design choices. Earlier this year, the typeface for the German soccer team DFB's jersey number 44 (which is not currently in use by the team, but which buyers can customize) was discovered to resemble the Nazi SS symbol. In 2022, Adidas broke ties with Ye, the rapper and designer formerly known as Kanye West, due to his multiple antisemitic comments.\n\nHadid, whose father was born in Nazareth, has been a vocal activist for Palestinians since long before October 7, 2023, and frequently uses her large social media presence to advocate for and bring attention to pro-Palestinian causes. She and her sister Gigi Hadid have together donated $1 million to support multiple Palestinian relief efforts in Gaza, including HEAL Palestine, Palestine Children's Relief Fund, World Central Kitchen, and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).\n\nHadid has occasionally shared misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war and received criticism for sharing social media posts downplaying the experiences of the Israelis held hostage in Gaza.\n\nAt the 1972 Munich Olympics, eight members of the Palestinian terror group Black September broke into the Israeli Olympic team's residence, immediately killing one coach and one member of the weightlifting team, and taking nine more Israeli team members hostage. All were killed during a botched rescue operation, as was a West German police officer.\n\nThe massacre was commemorated at the Olympics for the first time at the 2020 Games, held in 2021.

The 1972 Olympics in Munich, however, were overshadowed by a terrorist attack that left 11 Israeli athletes and one German police officer dead at the hands of a Palestinian militant group amid the Israeli-Palestine conflict.\n\nHadid, whose father is Palestinian, identifies as a \"proud Palestinian.\"\n\n\"We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events -- though these are completely unintentional -- and we apologize for any upset or distress caused,\" Adidas said in a statement to USA TODAY Sports on Thursday. \"As a result, we are revising the remainder of the campaign. We believe in sport as a unifying force around the world and will continue our efforts to champion diversity and equality in everything we do.\"\n\nAdidas' SL72 advertisements feature an Adidas-clad Hadid holding flowers, while showing off her sneakers. \"Giving Bella Hadid her flowers in the SL 72,\" read a tweet from Adidas Originals. But after the company issued an apology and promised to revise the campaign, all tweets featuring Hadid were scrubbed from Adidas Originals' X account and Instagram. Hadid is still featured on Adidas' website, as of Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe American Jewish Committee called on Adidas to address the \"egregious error.\"\n\n\"At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, 12 Israelis were murdered and taken hostage by Palestinian terrorist group Black September. For Adidas to pick a vocal anti-Israel model to recall this dark Olympics is either a massive oversight or intentionally inflammatory. Neither is acceptable,\" the AJC wrote on X Thursday.\n\nHadid is a vocal supporter of Palestine and frequently uses her platform to speak out against Palestinians impacted by the Israeli-Palestine conflict. She marched against former President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017, writing at the time, \"The TREATMENT of the Palestinian people is unfair, one-sided and should not be tolerated. I stand with Palestine.\" Last month, Hadid and her sister, fellow supermodel Gigi Hadid, donated $1 million to Palestinian relief efforts, according to BBC.\n\nSoccer player Jules Kound\u00e9, rapper A$AP Nast, musician Melissa Bon and model Sabrina Lan are also featured in the campaign, and all remain on Adidas' various social media accounts.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sneakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Hadid", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bella Hadid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Munich massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clothing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas_Originals", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adidas Originals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jewish_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Jewish Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_recognition_of_Jerusalem_as_capital_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Kound\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jules Kound\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black September Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigi_Hadid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gigi Hadid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermodel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supermodel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/qRhYF8LmoCkmNU8ZBqT5ZA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_sports_articles_558/6e0e37edbf1e131362e6bc407125a626", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744770", "eventUri": "eng-9744770", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-12-", "textStart": 2227, "textEnd": 2240}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Hadid, who was born in 1996, is Palestinian-American and has been a prominent advocate for Palestinian relief efforts. Adidas then seemingly deleted any social media posts featuring her after criticism from Jewish groups and Israel.\n\nAdidas' decision to remove Hadid from its social media feeds was then, in turn, criticized by pro-Palestinian voices for silencing people of Palestinian heritage, and for appearing to retaliate against Hadid on the basis of her heritage.\n\nBella Hadid has been a prominent supporter of Palestinian relief efforts.\n\nKirstin Sinclair/Getty Images\n\nCNN cannot independently verify Adidas' posts but screenshots of them have been widely circulated, including by the state of Israel's official X account, while a picture of Hadid remains on Adidas' website promoting the sneakers. Hadid's representatives have not yet responded to CNN's request for comment.\n\nHadid hasn't publicly commented about the controversy on her social media accounts, though she recently posted a photo of herself - uncaptioned - standing in front of an Adidas billboard, wearing one of the sportswear manufacturer's tops.\n\n\"We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events - though these are completely unintentional - and we apologize for any upset or distress caused,\" a spokesperson for Adidas said in a statement sent to CNN on Friday.\n\n\"As a result we are revising the remainder of the campaign. We believe in sport as a unifying force around the world and will continue our efforts to champion diversity and equality in everything we do,\" the company added.\n\nHadid, whose father is Palestinian-American real-estate developer Mohamed Hadid, has frequently spoken out about violence against Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nIn October last year, Bella Hadid wrote in a statement posted to Instagram: \"My heart is bleeding with pain from the trauma I am seeing unfold, as well as the generational trauma of my Palestinian blood,\" referencing those killed by Israeli airstrikes and military operations in Gaza - now more than 38,000 people in total, according to the enclave's Ministry of Health.\n\n\"I mourn for the Israeli families that have been dealing with the pain and aftermath of October 7,\" she added, referencing the day when Palestinian militants killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 people hostage.\n\nFor the American Jewish Committee, choosing a \"vocal anti-Israel model to recall this dark Olympics is either a massive oversight or intentionally inflammatory.\"\n\n\"Neither is acceptable,\" it added in a post on X. The group did not provide evidence or detail for its allegation that Hadid was \"anti-Israel.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Jonathan Greenblatt - the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League - wrote in his own post on the platform that Hadid's involvement in the campaign is a \"serious misjudgement that dishonors the victims\" of the 1972 terrorist attack.\n\nHowever, journalist Mehdi Hasan took issue with this line of criticism against Adidas and Hadid.\n\n\"Bella Hadid has absolutely nothing in common with the 1972 terrorists - other than the fact that she is Palestinian,\" Hasan posted on X.\n\n\"Blaming people for the crimes of others who share their race or ethnicity is pure racism & bigotry,\" he added.\n\nWhen contacted by CNN to respond to this critique, an AJC spokesperson said its \"criticism of Adidas making Bella Hadid one of the faces of this campaign has nothing to do with her ethnicity but her history of anti-Israel and antisemitic comments,\" without providing evidence for these allegations.\n\nThe Adidas controversy comes a week before the opening ceremony for the Paris Olympics.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri":

In an Instagram post made on Sunday, July 14, the model is seen standing in front of the ad, shown on a billboard in New York City's Times Square.\n\nOn Thursday, July 18, the American Jewish Committee spoke out against the campaign and called for Adidas to \"address this egregious error.\"\n\n\"At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, 12 Israelis were murdered and taken hostage by Palestinian terrorist group Black September,\" the Committee wrote on X. \"For Adidas to pick a vocal anti-Israel model to recall this dark Olympics is either a massive oversight or intentionally inflammatory.

The campaign featured \"titans from the world of sport and culture,\" including Hadid, soccer player Jules Kound\u00e9, rapper A$AP Nast, musician Melissa Bon, and model Sabrina Lan. The running sneaker was originally designed for runners in the Munich Olympics, where 11 Israeli athletes and coaches were killed in a terrorist attack perpetrated by the Palestinian group Black September.\n\nHadid has a history of criticizing Israel and accusing the Jewish state of colonization, ethnic cleansing, occupation, and apartheid over the Palestinian people. She has claimed Israel perpetrates a \"government system suppressing people,\" posted on social media about alleged \"Palestinian oppression\" under Israel, and in 2021 participated in a pro-Palestinian rally where she chanted \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,\" which has been widely interpreted as a call for the destruction of the Jewish state, which is located between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. Hadid has also falsely accused Israel of being a \"Jewish supremacist\" state and claimed \"Jesus was Palestinian.\"\n\nAdidas was founded by brothers and Nazi party members Adolf and Rudolf Dassler in Germany in 1924.\n\nYnet, which accused Adidas of displaying \"insensitivity\" in its collaboration with Hadid, reported that the campaign will not appear in Israel. The campaign has already been criticized by the state of Israel's official account on X/Twitter and also the watchdog group StopAntisemitism.org.\n\nThe Combat Antisemitism Movement (CAM) demanded that Adidas apologize and drop Hadid from the campaign, calling her inclusion \"an affront\" to the memory of the Israelis murdered at the 1972 Olympic Games.\n\n\"For Adidas to choose Hadid, someone who is constantly baiting Jews and attacking the Jewish State, is bad enough, but to have her launch a shoe commemorating an Olympics when so much Jewish blood was shed is just sick,\" CAM CEO Sacha Roytman Dratwa said in a statement. \"We call on Adidas to apologize for this decision and drop Hadid immediately. Otherwise, it will be seen as a direct attack on the memory of the 11 Israelis who were murdered while merely trying to participate in the Olympic Games.\"\n\nHe noted that the Israeli delegation heading to Paris for this year's Olympic Games has already been threatened with violence, adding, \"Thoughtless actions like this only embolden Israel haters and antisemites.\"\n\nSocial media users also attacked the German brand for hiring Hadid to be the face of a campaign tied to the deadly Munich Olympics where Israelis were murdered, describing the decision as \"simply unbelievable, hypocritical, and disgusting.\" One user on X/Twitter, wrote: \"Adidas just ruined their name and reputation with one disgusting decision.\"", "source": {"uri": "algemeiner.com", "dataType": "news",

We believe in sport as a unifying force around the world and will continue our efforts to champion diversity and equality in everything we do.\"\n\nHe did not say whether Adidas would remove Ms. Hadid from the ads. He also noted that the campaign uses \"a broad range of partners to celebrate our lightweight running shoe,\" including the U.S. rapper ASAP Nast.\n\nThe German apparel giant was accused of being tone-deaf at best -- and antisemitic at worst -- for relaunching its SL OG 72 athletic trainer ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics with Ms. Hadid.\n\nThe Combat Antisemitism Movement called previously on Adidas to \"apologize for this decision and drop Hadid immediately.\"\n\n\"For Adidas to choose Hadid, someone who is constantly baiting Jews and attacking the Jewish State, is bad enough, but to have her launch a shoe commemorating an Olympics when so much Jewish blood was shed is just sick,\" said CAM CEO Sacha Roytman in a Thursday statement.\n\nMs. Hadid is featured wearing the sneakers in the \"Originals\" ad campaign unveiled Monday, which includes a Times Square billboard.\n\nThe Palestinian terrorist organization Black September infiltrated the Olympic Village in September 1972, killing two members of the Israeli team and kidnapping nine others. All nine Israelis, an officer, and five terrorists were killed in a failed rescue operation by West German police.\n\n\"Thoughtless actions like this only embolden Israel haters and anti-Semites ahead of the Paris Olympics scheduled to start next week with an Israeli delegation that has already been repeatedly threatened with violence,\" said Mr. Roytman.\n\nThe launch of the 1972 retro shoe comes less than a year after Hamas terrorists killed 1,200 Israeli civilians and others and took 250 hostages. An estimated 116 people are still being held hostage, according to Amnesty International.\n\nConcerns over Ms. Hadid's Palestinian activism predate the massacre. In 2021, Stop Antisemitism Now launched a petition drive calling for companies to remove Ms. Hadid and her supermodel sister Gigi Hadid as their brand ambassadors.\n\nThe petition said the models are \"fanning the flames of antisemitism by spreading misinformation and perpetuating antisemitic tropes through their social media accounts on Twitter and Instagram.\" So far the petition has gathered 92,000 signatures.\n\nExamples include Ms. Hadid sharing on Instagram a \"Free Palestine\" post accusing Israel of \"colonization, ethnic cleansing, military occupation and apartheid over the Palestinian people that has been going on for YEARS!\"\n\nShe has also attended at least two pro-Palestinian rallies, including a 2017 protest in London opposing then-President Donald Trump's decision to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nThe Tafsik Organization, a group that fights antisemitism, asked whether Adidas was \"insane.\"\n\n\"Is this real??? Jew hating Palestinian, Bella Hadid, is the face of the 1972 Munich Olympics @adidas shoes, where Palestinian terrorists slaughtered the entire Israeli team??\" asked Tafsik on X. \"IS THIS ACTUALLY REAL??? Is Adidas completely INSANE????\"\n\nBuying the shoe may be a challenge. The SL 72 OG, which retails for $100, was sold out on the U.S. Adidas and Nordstrom websites as of Thursday morning.\n\n\"As their name suggests, these 'Super Light' silhouettes were first launched in 1972 to equip athletes at the Munich Olympic Games,\" said Vogue magazine in a July 12 article. \"They revolutionized running and were intended to be worn between competitions.\"\n\nThe Israeli publication Ynet said it has learned that \"the campaign will not appear in Israel.\"\n\nThe Washington Times has reached out to Adidas for comment.\n\nThe promo for the ad campaign touts the retro 1972 sneaker as a shoe worn by \"true Originals.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Bella Hadid, a model with Palestinian roots who has spread anti-Semitism in the past and incited violence against Israelis and Jews,\" the Israeli embassy in Germany wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Thursday.\n\n\"How can Adidas now claim that the reference (to the events in Munich) was 'completely unintentional'?\" Ron Prosor, Israel's ambassador to Germany, said in response to the company's climbdown.\n\n\"The terror of 1972 is etched into the collective memory of Germans and Israelis,\" he told Die Welt TV on Friday.\n\nA flood of social media posts meanwhile expressed support for Bella Hadid, criticised Adidas for axing the model, and called for a boycott of the company.\n\nPro-Palestinian demonstrations\n\nThe Gaza war was triggered by the October 7 attack by Palestinian Hamas militants on southern Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nIsrael's military retaliation to wipe out Hamas has killed at least 38,848 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza.\n\nBella Hadid has taken part in several pro-Palestinian demonstrations during the conflict and has described Israel's offensive as a \"genocide\".\n\nIn 2021, Bella Hadid, her sister Gigi Hadid and singer Dua Lipa were described as anti-Semitic in an advertisement published in The New York Times by a Jewish group called the World Values Network.\n\nAdidas said it would be continuing the SL72 campaign with other famous faces including footballer Jules Kounde, singer Melissa Bon and model Sabrina Lan.\n\nIn late 2022, Adidas ended its contract with the US rapper now known formally as Ye after he triggered an outcry with a series of anti-Semitic social media posts.\n\nGermany's response to the Hamas attack and ensuing war has been driven by guilt over its own dark past, and the slaughter of six million Jews by the Nazis during the Holocaust.\n\nThe country has steadfastly backed Israel in the conflict, but its unwavering stance has led to claims that Palestinian voices are being marginalised.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been

A better world for our people and the people around them. They can never erase our history.

Some of the cash was allegedly set for the UN's embattled refugee aid agency, which fired some of its employees after they were linked to Hamas.\n\nIn March, the Hadids' father, Palestinian-born real estate tycoon Mohamed Hadid, called President Joe Biden a \"Zionist criminal\" and claimed that he and others would be \"hunted down\" like Nazis.\n\nHe also sent a barrage of racist and homophobic messages to Rep. Ritchie Torres, according to screenshots obtained by The Post.\n\nAdidas' removal of the campaign photos fired up pro-Palestinians on social media. Some called for an Adidas boycott and accused the shoe company of racism over suspicions it has fired the half-Palestinian model.\n\n\"Adidas just canceled Bella Hadid's modelling contract because she's Palestinian,\" one user wrote, receiving 10,000 likes. \"#Adidas is racist, #BoycottAdidas.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [],

Hadid, who was born in 1996, is Palestinian-American and has been a prominent advocate for Palestinian relief efforts. Adidas then seemingly deleted any social media posts featuring her after criticism from Jewish groups and Israel.\n\nAdidas' decision to remove Hadid from its social media feeds was then, in turn, criticized by pro-Palestinian voices for silencing people of Palestinian heritage, and for appearing to retaliate against Hadid on the basis of her heritage.\n\nCNN cannot independently verify Adidas' posts but screenshots of them have been widely circulated, including by the state of Israel's official X account, while a picture of Hadid remains on Adidas' website promoting the sneakers. Hadid's representatives have not yet responded to CNN's request for comment.\n\nHadid hasn't publicly commented about the controversy on her social media accounts, though she recently posted a photo of herself - uncaptioned - standing in front of an Adidas billboard, wearing one of the sportswear manufacturer's tops.\n\n\"We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events - though these are completely unintentional - and we apologize for any upset or distress caused,\" a spokesperson for Adidas said in a statement sent to CNN on Friday.\n\n\"As a result we are revising the remainder of the campaign. We believe in sport as a unifying force around the world and will continue our efforts to champion diversity and equality in everything we do,\" the company added.\n\nHadid, whose father is Palestinian-American real-estate developer Mohamed Hadid, has frequently spoken out about violence against Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nIn October last year, Bella Hadid wrote in a statement posted to Instagram: \"My heart is bleeding with pain from the trauma I am seeing unfold, as well as the generational trauma of my Palestinian blood,\" referencing those killed by Israeli airstrikes and military operations in Gaza - now more than 38,000 people in total, according to the enclave's Ministry of Health.\n\n\"I mourn for the Israeli families that have been dealing with the pain and aftermath of October 7,\" she added, referencing the day when Palestinian militants killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 people hostage.\n\nFor the American Jewish Committee, choosing a \"vocal anti-Israel model to recall this dark Olympics is either a massive oversight or intentionally inflammatory.\"\n\n\"Neither is acceptable,\" it added in a post on X. The group did not provide evidence or detail for its allegation that Hadid was \"anti-Israel.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Jonathan Greenblatt - the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League - wrote in his own post on the platform that Hadid's involvement in the campaign is a \"serious misjudgement that dishonors the victims\" of the 1972 terrorist attack.\n\nHowever, journalist Mehdi Hasan took issue with this line of criticism against Adidas and Hadid.\n\n\"Bella Hadid has absolutely nothing in common with the 1972 terrorists - other than the fact that she is Palestinian,\" Hasan posted on X.\n\n\"Blaming people for the crimes of others who share their race or ethnicity is pure racism & bigotry,\" he added.\n\nWhen contacted by CNN to respond to this critique, an AJC spokesperson said its \"criticism of Adidas making Bella Hadid one of the faces of this campaign has nothing to do with her ethnicity but her history of anti-Israel and antisemitic comments,\" without providing evidence for these allegations.\n\nThe Adidas controversy comes a week before the opening ceremony for the Paris Olympics.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

It added: 'Adidas should be ashamed'.\n\nThe German clothing firm announced the SL 72 range this week which includes an 'OG' trainer - standing for Olympic Games.\n\nA description reads: 'First released in 1972 to equip athletes for the Summer event, the adidas SL72 OG shoes have a lightweight build that revolutionised running.'\n\nThe StopAntisemitism group said 'the shoe fits' for Adidas choosing Hadid to front a 1972 Olympics shoe 'relaunch' given it previously came under fire for its relationship with rapper Kanye West.\n\nWest was eventually let go for saying there's 'a lot of things I love about Hitler', but last year Adidas Chief Executive Bj\u00f8rn Gulden said it was 'very unfortunate' they parted ways.\n\nAdidas made the announcement on social media, describing the trainer as a 'retro-inspired classic with effortless appeal'\n\nThe supermodel shared a post on her Instagram stories last month in which she claimed that Hamas made released hostage Almog Meir Jan, 21, a birthday cake while he was held in captivity (left). She also shared a separate post (right) seemingly suggesting that Hamas hostages are treated better than Palestinians detained in Israel\n\nHadid last month falsely claimed that hostage Almog Meir Jan, 21, was made a birthday cake by Hamas before Israeli special forces rescued him.\n\nShe posted a picture of him hugging his mother after being saved and wrote: 'Released Israeli captive revealed that Ham@s made him a birthday cake during captivity.'\n\nMr Meir Jan was held in chains by his captors who forced him to use a bucket for a toilet and regularly beat him and fellow hostages over eight months.\n\nWhile he has not been interviewed since his rescue his family say they have 'no idea' where claims he was made a birthday cake came from.\n\nMs Hadid, whose father is a Palestinian property tycoon, has been a vocal critic of Israel throughout the war.\n\nThe Israel Olympic Committee refuted reports that the 1972 memorial has been moved over security concerns this year saying it was nothing more than a logistical issue.\n\nAn Adidas spokesman said: 'We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events - though these are completely unintentional - and we apologise for any upset or distress caused.\n\n'As a result we are revising the remainder of the campaign.

This decision led to criticism from the AJC due to Hadid's vocal support for Palestinian causes amid ongoing conflicts between Hamas and the Israeli Defense Forces.\n\nThe AJC released a statement saying, \"At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, 12 Israelis were murdered and taken hostage by Palestinian terrorist group Black September. For Adidas to pick a vocal anti-Israel model to recall this dark Olympics is either a massive oversight or intentionally inflammatory. Neither is acceptable.

Always... While I still have to go to work , even through this horror, to wear our culture makes me a proud Palestinian & I want the world to continue to see Palestine, wherever we go.\"\n\nShe has also shared the controversial and unfounded claims on her social media that Israel \"beheaded children\" in an attack on a tent camp in Gaza, and that Israel is \"holding more hostages than Hamas\" in reference to the many Palestinians held in Israeli jails.\n\nKanye West partnership\n\nIn 2022 Adidas terminated its partnership with rapper and fashion designer Kanye West after he made a series of anti-Semitic remarks, a move that knocked the musician off the Forbes list of the world's billionaires.\n\nIn one tweet, the musician called for \"death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE\".\n\nAdidas said in response that it \"does not tolerate anti-Semitism and any other sort of hate speech\".\n\nMs Hadid said in apparent response to West's remarks: \"To my Jewish loved ones, the Jewish communities worldwide, I am here to say that you belong, you are worthy and your right as a human being is to be ALIVE.

Bella Hadid, a model with Palestinian roots who has spread anti-Semitism in the past and incited violence against Israelis and Jews,\" the Israeli embassy in Germany wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Thursday.\n\n\"How can Adidas now claim that the reference (to the events in Munich) was 'completely unintentional'?\" Ron Prosor, Israel's ambassador to Germany, said in response to the company's climbdown.\n\n\"The terror of 1972 is etched into the collective memory of Germans and Israelis,\" he told Die Welt TV on Friday.\n\nA flood of social media posts meanwhile expressed support for Hadid, criticised Adidas for axing the model, and called for a boycott of the company.\n\n- Pro-Palestinian demonstrations -\n\nThe Gaza war was triggered by the October 7 attack by Palestinian Hamas militants on southern Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nIsrael's military retaliation to wipe out Hamas has killed at least 38,848 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza.\n\nHadid has taken part in several pro-Palestinian demonstrations during the conflict and has described Israel's offensive as a \"genocide\".\n\nIn 2021, Hadid, her sister Gigi Hadid and singer Dua Lipa were described as anti-Semitic in an advertisement published in The New York Times by a Jewish group called the World Values Network.\n\nAdidas said it would be continuing the SL72 campaign with other famous faces including footballer Jules Kounde, singer Melissa Bon and model Sabrina Lan.\n\nIn late 2022, Adidas ended its contract with the US rapper now known formally as Ye after he triggered an outcry with a series of anti-Semitic social media posts.\n\nGermany's response to the Hamas attack and ensuing war has been driven by guilt over its own dark past, and the slaughter of six million Jews by the Nazis during the Holocaust.\n\nThe country has steadfastly backed Israel in the conflict, but its unwavering stance has led to claims that Palestinian voices are being marginalised.\n\njpl-fec/hmn/jj\n\nMore from this section\n\nPresident Dr. Mohamed Irfaan

Bella Hadid, the person supporting Hamas terrorists who committed a massacre I Israel just 9 months ago,\" he posted, adding that it was a \"unbelievable, hypocritical and disgusting\" campaign.\n\nThe StopAntisemitism NGO page on X also echoed his comments.\n\n\"Antisemite Bella Hadid was chosen by Adidas as the face for the 1972 Olympic shoe relaunch. The same Olympics in which Jews were butchered by Palestinian terrorists,\" a post from them read.\n\nOli London, an English Internet personality joined in the condemnation of Hadid.\n\n\"Bella Hadid, who has sparked outrage for her anti-Israel activism is the new face of Adidas' 1972 Munch Olympic shoe range.

Would be cool if they brought that back for Bella Hadid ambassador launch,\" one social media user said in response to the promotional video.\n\nOthers said the link to Bella Hadid and the attack at the 1972 Olympics was baseless, as it was before Hadid was born.\n\nSome also used the announcement as an opportunity to call for Israel to be banned from the Olympics as Israel's war on Gaza rages on, devastating the enclave and levelling entire neighbourhoods.\n\nLast week, a renowned Gaza goal keeper, Shadi Abu-Alarraj, from Khan Younis, was killed in Israel's attack on Al Mawasi according to local Palestinian media. The deadly attack on the area killed at least 90 Palestinians who were sheltering in the area, with the Palestinian ministry of health saying half of those killed were women and children.\n\nAn 11-year-old identified as Yazan Al-Sarsawi was also killed by Israeli fire in a direct shot to the head during an Israeli operation in Shujaiyya, east of Gaza City earlier this month.\n\nEstimates from activists in Gaza state that around 350 sports players and athletes have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war on the enclave on 7 October. The figure includes at least 250 footballers.\n\nThe number of Gaza athletes killed has promoted many to call for Israel to be banned from the upcoming competition in Paris and face accountability.", "source": {"uri": "newarab.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Arab"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Hadid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bella Hadid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Munich massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Square", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Times Square"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enclave and exclave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.newarab.com/sites/default/files/styles/600x338/public/media/images/430EA14B-6902-4292-9F81-5E8C8A0AD721.jpg?h=d1cb525d&itok=TA91dLRK", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744770", "eventUri": "eng-9744770", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2950, "textEnd": 2959}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

She also said she received hundreds of death threats and was doxxed over her support of Palestine.\n\nThe Adidas campaign drew immediate backlash, as users recalled that the company's founder was a card-carrying member of the Nazi Party.\n\n\"So Adidas picks a Palestinian woman to celebrate the year Palestinians slaughtered Jews at the Olympics. You really can never hide your true Nazi colors, can you?\" one person said.\n\n\"Still haven't let go of your Nazi roots,\" echoed someone else.\n\n\"This is not a mistake, it's by design,\" blasted another prominent pro-Israel user, who later added: \"Adidas, are you threatening Jews?\"\n\nHe added in a separate post: \"Adidas: Founded by Nazi Adolf Dassler. Kept working with Kanye for years despite his antisemitism. Now doing a campaign with Bella Hadid, who shared pro-Hamas propaganda to her 61M followers. Some things never change...\"\n\nIn response to the campaign, one person said she decided to throw out her Adidas shoes. Others similarly began deploying the hashtag #BoycottAdidas.\n\n\"First Kanye and now another Antisemite to celebrate the Munich Massacre?\" one user said, referencing the rapper's antisemitic remarks that prompted the brand to drop him. \"You hate Jews and learned nothing. Here's a tip: you could showcase an ATHLETE since you're an athletic brand. This disgusting choice was blatant and obvious and we will #BoycottAdidas\"", "source": {"uri": "dailydot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Dot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katherine_huggins@dailydot.com", "name": "Katherine Huggins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Munich massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Hadid", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bella Hadid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black September Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigi_Hadid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gigi Hadid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hashtag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://uploads.dailydot.com/2024/07/Bella-and-Adidas.jpg?auto=compress&fm=pjpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744770", "eventUri": "eng-9744770", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1200, "textEnd": 1206}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Especially simply because of their ethnicity, culture or pure hatred,\" she wrote in a post on Instagram.\n\nA spokeswoman from Adidas confirmed that Hadid had been removed from the campaign, which notes that the shoes were first introduced in 1972 but never mentions the attack on the Israeli athletes.\n\nThe Israeli embassy in Germany criticised the choice of Hadid for the campaign.\n\n\"Guess who the face of the campaign is? Bella Hadid, a model with Palestinian roots who has spread anti-Semitism in the past and incited violence against Israelis and Jews,\" the Israeli embassy in Germany wrote on X on Thursday.\n\n\"How can Adidas now claim that the reference [to the events in Munich] was 'completely unintentional'?\" Ron Prosor, Israel's ambassador to Germany, said in response to the company's climbdown.\n\n\"The terror of 1972 is etched into the collective memory of Germans and Israelis,\" he told Die Welt TV on Friday.\n\nA flood of social media posts, meanwhile, expressed support for Hadid, criticised Adidas for axing the model and called for a boycott of the company.\n\nAdidas said it would continue the SL72 campaign with other famous faces, including footballer Jules Kounde, singer Melissa Bon

Bella Hadid, a half-Palestinian model who has a history of spreading antisemitism and calling for violence against Israelis and Jews,\" the account, run by the Israel Foreign Ministry, posted.\n\nThe pro-Israel American Jewish Committee also blasted the shoemaker for the insensitive ad campaign.\n\n\"For Adidas to pick a vocal anti-Israel model to recall this dark Olympics is either a massive oversight or intentionally inflammatory. Neither is acceptable,\" the organization tweeted.\n\n\"We call on Adidas to address this egregious error.\"\n\nIn May, Hadid, 27, honored her Palestinian heritage at the Cannes Film Festival 2024, donning a dress made out of keffiyeh fabric -- a checkered traditional Arab headdress that's become a symbol of Palestinian solidarity and identity at protests.\n\nIn June, it was reported that Bella and Gigi Hadid planned to donate $1 million to support Palestinian relief efforts.\n\nSome of the cash was expected to go to the UN's embattled United Nations Relief and Works Agency aid agency, whose employees have been linked to Hamas.\n\nUNRWA announced it January had fired nine of its 12 staffers who Israel alleged were involved in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that left roughly 1,200 dead, with another 253 kidnapped.\n\nBella previously marched on behalf of her brethren during protests in 2021.\n\nOther faces of the ad campaign include French soccer star Jules Kound\u00e9, rapper and songwriter A$AP Nast, musician Melissa Bon and model Sabrina Lan, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe Post has reached out to Adidas for comment.\n\nHadid's father, Mohamed Anwar Hadid, was born to a Palestinian Muslim family and has long been vocal about Palestinian rights.\n\nHe came under fire earlier this year after he sent an exploitative-laced message attacking New York Congressman Ritchie Torres -- a progressive Democrat who supports Israel.

Otherwise, it will be seen as a direct attack on the memory of the eleven Israelis who were murdered while merely trying to participate in the Olympic Games,\" she added.\n\nIsraeli writer and prominent pro-Israel social media influencer Hen Mazzig chimed in.\n\n\"This is not a mistake, it's by design. A Palestinian model, notorious for spreading blood libel and vile hate speech against Jews, is now referencing the 1972 Munich Olympics, where Palestinian terrorists slaughtered Israeli athletes,\" he wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"@Adidas, are you threatening Jews?\" he added.\n\nDuring the 1972 Olympic games eight Palestinian terrorists broke into the Olympic village, killing two members of the Israeli Olympic team hostage immediately and taking nine others hostage.\n\nThe assailants -- operating under the terrorist organization Black September -- ended up murdering six Israeli coaches, five Israeli athletes, and one German police officer.\n\nThe model at the center of the controversy, Ms. Hadid, is half-Dutch and half-Palestinian and has been an outspoken supporter of Palestinians since before the onset of the war.\n\nShe has also, however, been accused of \"fanning the flames of antisemitism\" by spreading misinformation about Israel to her some 61 million followers on Instagram -- a figure nearly four times the number of Jews in the world.\n\nBack in November, Ms. Hadid came under fire for circulating the false claim that \"Israel is the only country in the world that keeps children as prisoners of war\" even while Hamas held some 200 Israelis captive, including one as young as a 10-month old.\n\nShe followed up by sharing a photo of a Palestinian boy who was detained by Israeli police after he, at the age of 13, attempted to kill two Israelis during a stabbing rampage with his cousin.\n\n\"Ahmed Manasra, abducted by the Israeli occupation at the age of 12, has endured solitary confinement despite his severe health condition. Hundreds of Palestinian children remain detained. Suffering in Israeli jails,\" she wrote.\n\nMs. Hadid has also been accused of attempting to portray Hamas terrorists positively after she shared an infographic which claimed that rescued Israeli hostage Almog Meir Jan had been given a cake by his captors while spending his birthday in captivity.\n\nMr. Jan was taken from the Nova festival on October 7 and was held hostage in the home of Palestinian Chronicle correspondent Abdallah Aljamal. He, and the other hostages who were freed from Aljamal's home in central Gaza reportedly suffered from serious malnutrition during their 245 days in captivity.\n\nShe has also publicly accused Israel of being an apartheid \"Jewish supremacist\" state -- a claim which the Anti-Defamation League debunks as \"inaccurate, offensive, and often used to delegitimize and denigrate Israel as a whole.\"\n\nIn response to Ms. Hadid's social media posts, American advocacy group StopAntisemitism has even set up an entire webpage dedicated to publicizing her alleged antisemitic transgressions.\n\nStopAntisemism also came out against the Adidas campaign, alluding to prior accusations of antisemitism waged against the German shoe company.\n\n\"If the shoe fits,\" they wrote on X, tagging Adidas. \"How on par,\" they added.\n\nAdidas had to cut ties with rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, after he publicly praised Adolf Hitler and spread antisemitic tropes on social media. He also took to X to announce his plan of \"going death con 3 ON JEWISH PEOPLE .\"\n\nA year after the shoe company put an end to their sneaker line with Mr. West, the chief executive of Adidas, Bj\u00f8rn Gulden, was accused of attempting to downplay the disgraced rapper's allegations of antisemitism.\n\n\"I don't think he meant what he said and I don't think he's a bad person -- it just came across that way,\" Mr. Gulden said while guest starring on a podcast.\n\nAfter the podcast surfaced, head of the American Jewish Committee, Ted Deutch, stated that he spoke with Mr. Gulden to remind him \"that Ye's antisemitic tirade has real world consequences that can neither be minimized nor dismissed for any reason.\"\n\nMr. Deutch added that The American Jewish Committee has documented several instances of antisemitic incidents linked to the disgraced rapper's antisemitic comments.\n\nMs. Hadid has yet to address the criticism over her campaign.", "source": {"uri":

A retro sneaker, an Olympics fashion moment, a yeehaw fashion model holding a bouquet of flowers -- what could go wrong? A lot, apparently, because Hadid appears to have been removed from the campaign after pro-Israel groups accused Adidas of antisemitism.\n\nThe allegations stem from a tragedy that unfolded during the second week of the 1972 Games, which saw the militant Palestinian group Black September kidnap and massacre 11 Israeli athletes and coaches. While the marketing does seem to reference the 1972 Olympics, there's no explicit mention of the Munich massacre. For some, those origins make the presence of Hadid, a vocal advocate for Palestinian rights, a huge problem. In a widely distributed statement, the American Jewish Committee described her as a \"vocal anti-Israel model,\" saying her presence in the campaign was \"either a massive oversight or intentionally inflammatory.\" Meanwhile, on X, the State of Israel accused Hadid of \"spreading antisemitism\" and \"calling for violence against Israelis and Jews.\"\n\nTo be clear, Hadid, whose family is Palestinian, has condemned terrorist attacks on Israel while criticizing the Israeli government's violent attacks on civilians in Gaza. But for Adidas, a German company with historic Nazi ties that was one of the last brands to part ways with Kanye West after his string of antisemitic comments, these accusations were too much to bear. The brand swiftly released an apology and has reportedly removed Hadid from the campaign.\n\n\"We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events -- though these are completely unintentional -- and we apologize for any upset or distress caused,\" Adidas's statement said. \"As a result, we are revising the remainder of the campaign. We believe in sport as a unifying force around the world and will continue our efforts to champion diversity and equality in everything we do.\" Will they, though?", "source": {"uri": "thecut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Cut"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danielle_cohen@thecut.com", "name": "Danielle Cohen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Munich massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Hadid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bella Hadid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black September Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jewish_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Jewish Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c6b/f06/1da3346e1cb5547ef9159e6c68b472fa0c-bella-hadid-adidas.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744770", "eventUri": "eng-9744770", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Courtesy of Adidas\n\nFor a company whose founder was a literal Nazi, you would think Adidas might tread lightly launching a shoe referencing the 1972 Munich Olympics, when 11 members of the Israeli delegation were killed after being taken hostage by a Palestinian terrorist group.\n\nInstead, the company made Bella Hadid -- a supermodel of Palestinian descent who once called Israel \"a Jewish supremacist state\" -- the face of the new SL72 sneaker's marketing campaign.\n\nNow, responding to backlash on social media, the company is changing course, the second time this year it has required damage control for missteps related to antisemitism.\n\n\"We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events -- though these are completely unintentional -- and we apologize for any upset or distress caused,\" the company said Thursday in a statement. \"As a result we are revising the remainder of the campaign.\"\n\nHadid, 29, is one of the highest-earning models in the world and -- with legions of fans and some 60 million followers on Instagram -- one of the most influential supporters of the Palestinian cause.\n\nBut Hadid, whose father is the Palestinian American real estate mogul Mohamed Hadid, has occasionally been criticized for straying into antisemitism with her comments on Israel.\n\nIn her first statement post-Oct. 7, Hadid stated Oct. 26 that she was mourning for the Israeli victims of the Hamas attack.\n\n\"Regardless of the history of the land, I condemn the terrorist attacks on any civilians, anywhere,\" she said.\n\nSince then, she has made multiple retractions following posts about the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nIn November, she took down a post claiming Israel was the only country that kept children as \"prisoners of war\" -- using as an example a Palestinian who was 13 when he, along with his brother, stabbed an Israeli security guard and another 13-year-old boy in Jerusalem. (The boy was sentenced to 12 years in prison, later reduced to 9.5 years.)\n\nAfter Almog Meir Jan, an Israeli hostage, was rescued from captivity, Hadid reposted a since-deleted story that his captors had baked him a birthday cake. Meir Jan said his captors starved him and the cake was a cynical gesture.\n\nAdidas was founded by Adolf (Adi) Dassler, who joined the Nazi party three months after Hitler came to power. In 1935, he expanded the company to equip Hitler Youth clubs. He signed letters to his brother \"Heil Hitler.\"\n\nThe 1972 Munich massacre was carried out by eight members of the Palestinian terrorist group Black September, who infiltrated the Olympic village and killed an Israeli athlete as well as a coach, taking three more coaches and six athletes hostage.\n\nThe nine were tortured in their captivity and killed during a botched rescue operation. The games proceeded, and Jewish swimmer Mark Spitz set a then-record with seven gold medals.\n\nThe SL72 was originally introduced at the 1972 Olympics as a running sneaker, and is now being released as a casual shoe. StandWithUs, a pro-Israel advocacy group, slammed Adidas for \"commemorating\" that year's games.\n\nEarlier this year, Adidas recalled German national team soccer jerseys after people pointed out that the number 4 looked like a Nazi SS bolt.", "source": {"uri": "forward.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Forward"}, "authors": [{"uri": "louis_keene@forward.com", "name": "Louis Keene",

The campaign features model Bella Hadid and the shoe pays homage to the original shoe, which was released by the company in 1972 ahead of the Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany and worn by many track-and-field athletes in the Games.\n\nThe problem is that the '72 Olympics are most known for a terrorist attack on Israeli athletes and coaches by a Palestinian militant group. The attack is referred to as the \"Munich Massacre.\"\n\nGiven the current state of affairs between Palestine and Israel, the latter took great offense to the use of this advertisement ahead of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.\n\nThe official X (formerly Twitter) account of the state of Israel posted a scathing commentary about the decision by Adidas to promote this shoe - with Bella Hadid - during a tumultuous time.\n\n\"Adidas recently launched a new campaign for their shoes to highlight the 1972 Munich Olympics. Eleven Israelis were murdered by Palestinian terrorists during the Munich Olympics,\" the account, which is run by Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, wrote.\n\n\"Guess who the face of their campaign is? Bella Hadid, a half-Palestinian model who has a history of spreading antisemitism and calling for violence against Israelis and Jews.\"\n\nTammy Rahamimoff-Honig, a Deputy Head of the Israel Foreign Ministry, noted that the positioning of the shoes in the advertisement bears a resemblance to the \"red triangle\" that Hamas uses to identify Israeli targets.\n\n\"Is it possible the Adidas ad also hints at Hamas' repugnant red triangle indicating the slaughter of Israelis/Jews?\" she wrote.\n\nAccording to CBC, \"The inverted red triangle has been used in videos by the Al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas's military wing, to identify Israeli military targets, such as tanks, in Gaza as Israel began its ground invasion there. A caricature mocking Israeli soldiers included the symbol, as do many pro-Palestinian social media posts.\"\n\nOutKick reached out to Adidas to ask if the company considered the potential optics when deciding to release this campaign.\n\n\"We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events -- though these are completely unintentional -- and we apologize for any upset or distress caused,\" the company said in a statement.\n\n\"As a result, we are revising the remainder of the campaign. We believe in sport as a unifying force around the world and will continue our efforts to champion diversity and equality in everything we do.\"\n\nIt appears that revision is already taking place.

(Image released by Adidas.)]\n\nLeading fashion brand, Adidas, has collaborated with Palestinian Supermodel Bella Hadid for the relaunch of the 1972 Olympic shoes, and the move has outraged the Zionists.\n\n\"We're reintroducing the world to SL 72 by launching five colorways of the iconic sneaker. Two distinct iterations of the iconic SL series - SL 72 RS and SL 72 OG - are being launched in white, red, black, blue and yellow colorways\", Adidas said.\n\n\"Paying homage to the many thousands of Originals, the return of the SL 72 is brought to life with a campaign shot by Kenny Germ\u00e9 and starring titans from the world of sport and culture - including Supermodel, Bella Hadid, footballer, Jules Kound\u00e9, creative polymath, A$AP Nast, musician Melissa Bon and model, Sabrina Lan\", the fashion brand added.\n\nThe SL 72 sneaker was first unveiled in 1972 that coincided with Munich Olympics 1972.\n\nHeld in September 1972, the Munich Summer Olympic, besides other things, is remembered for the attack on the Israeli team by the Palestinian Resistance Fighters, nicknamed Black September.\n\nThe Palestinian fighters infiltrated the Olympic Village, killed two members of the Israeli Olympic team, and took nine others hostage on September 05, 1972.\n\nThe Resistance Fighters in return of the hostages were demanding the release of 234 Palestinian prisoners who were being held in Israeli jails.\n\nInstead of negotiation, West German police ambushed the Palestinian fighters, killed 5 of the 8 Black September members, and also killed the nine Israeli hostages in the failed rescue operation.\n\nTo avenge the attack on its athletes, Israel launched an assassination campaign codenamed \"Operation Wrath of God\". A number of Palestinian leaders including those associated with Fatah, Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) were assassinated one after the other.\n\nIncidentally, the relaunch of Adidas SL 72 shoes is taking place at the time when the far right Zionist regime in Israel is facing the wrath of the world, including a huge majority of Jews, for its brazen and genocidal military operation in Gaza that has left close to 39,000 Palestinians dead, more than 70% of them women and children.\n\nBella Hadid had joined top Hollywood actors to condemn the massacre of Palestinians in Gaza. She has spoken on a number of times demanding immediate ceasefire in the besieged enclave, over 60% of which has completely or partly damaged by the Israeli bombing.\n\nIt is against this backdrop, the Zionists are fuming in rage after Adidas collaborated with Palestinian Supermodel Bella Hadid for the relaunch of the Adidas 1972 Munich Olympic Running Shoes.\n\n\"Antisemite\" Bella Hadid was chosen by Adidas as the face for the 1972 Olympic shoe relaunch. The same Olympics in which Jews were \"butchered\" by \"Palestinian terrorists\", Stop Antisemitism, a US-based organisation fighting antisemitism, wrote in a social media post. (Emphasis added)\n\nIs this real? \"Jew hating\" Palestinian, Bella Hadid, is the face of the 1972 Munich Olympics Adidas shoes, where \"Palestinian terrorists\" slaughtered the entire Israeli team? Tafsik Organization, another organisation which claims to be fighting antisemitism wrote on social media platform X.\n\nThe organisations claimed that the entire Israeli team was killed by the Palestinian Resistance Fighters while the fact is that nine of them were killed in the failed rescue operation carried by the West German Police.\n\nBut there are some others who hail the Adidas decision to choose Bella Hadid for the SL 72 relaunch.\n\n\"Adidas has chosen Palestinian model Bella Hadid as the face for the 1972 Olympic shoe relaunch.

The campaign features Bella Hadid, a half-Palestinian model known for her outspoken anti-Israel sentiments.\n\nHadid's involvement has raised many concerns. The Palestinian-American model's appearance on a prominent Times Square billboard has drawn considerable attention. Her high-profile endorsement has heightened the debate over Adidas's choice, given her history of spreading antisemitism and advocating for violence against Israelis and Jew\n\nThe Munich Olympics are notoriously remembered for the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists. The association of the 1972 Olympics with such a dark chapter in history adds a layer of complexity to the current marketing campaign. Critics argue that featuring Hadid, considering her activism and the historical context, is particularly insensitive.\n\nMoreover, Hadid and her father have frequently promoted blood libels and antisemitic conspiracies. This new campaign emerges amidst Adidas's controversial past, including its founding by Nazi Adolf Dassler and its long-term partnership with Kanye West despite his antisemitic remarks. These ongoing decisions continue to raise questions about Adidas's ethical commitments and marketing strategies.\n\n.\n\nAdidas's founder, Adolf Dassler, was a member of the Nazi Party, and the company's early history is tainted by its ties to the Nazi regime. This dark past often resurfaces during controversies like the current campaign.\n\nBella Hadid has been criticized for her anti-Israel remarks on multiple occasions. For example, she once shared a post accusing Israel of ethnic cleansing and has consistently voiced support for pro-Palestinian causes, sometimes in ways that have been interpreted as antisemitic. Her father, Mohamed Hadid, has also made inflammatory comments, including comparing Zionists to Nazis, which has drawn widespread condemnation.\n\nAdditionally, Adidas's partnership with Kanye West, who has made numerous antisemitic comments, further complicates the company's public image. Despite the backlash, Adidas maintained its association with West for a considerable time, leading many to question the brand's stance on antisemitism.\n\nAs Adidas continues to face scrutiny over its ethical choices, the latest campaign featuring Bella Hadid serves as a reminder of the complex interplay between historical events, modern-day activism, and corporate responsibility.", "source": {"uri": "tjvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Hadid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bella Hadid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Munich massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Square", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Times Square"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_libel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blood libel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Dassler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adolf Dassler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethnic cleansing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://tjvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Munich-72.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744770", "eventUri": "eng-9744770", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The Munich Games are mostly associated with one thing: the attack on Israeli athletes.\n\nImagine, for a moment, being an Olympic athlete from Israel.\n\nImagine living your whole life knowing that the dream you train every day to achieve is inexorably linked to one of the most traumatic events in your country's history when 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team lost their lives during a terror attack at the 1972 Munich Games.\n\nImagine trying to prepare for an Olympics while grief and chaos has gripped your country for the past nine months since Hamas terrorists breached the border with Gaza and killed approximately 1,200 Israelis while taking 250 hostages in the surprise attack last Oct. 7.\n\nImagine watching so many people around the world turn against your country for responding to an existential threat with forceful military action.\n\nAnd then imagine preparing to go to France, a country rife with antisemitism against the 500,000 or so Jews still remaining in the country, and knowing that any success you might have will be viewed as controversial because of your government's excesses and the terrible humanitarian toll of the war it is waging in Gaza. In some circles, their mere presence at the world's biggest sporting event will make them pariahs -- and potentially targets.\n\nIsraeli athletes at the Paris Games are going to have it hard enough. They don't need one of the most iconic brands in sports joining the antisemitism pile-on.\n\nWhat Adidas did this week in launching its SL 72 sneaker -- and putting a famous anti-Israel propagandist at the front of its marketing campaign -- is an outrage.\n\nIt was also a choice, and one that neither Israelis nor Jews around the world should ever forgive.\n\nMistakes happen in marketing, even in large conglomerates with layers of public relations experts. But this kind of corporate provocation is so bizarre and so obviously inappropriate that the logical conclusion to be drawn is that Adidas wanted to make some kind of sick, twisted statement that flies in the face of everything the Olympics are supposed to represent.\n\nFirst of all, Adidas relaunching the original SL 72 sneaker, which debuted at the 1972 Olympics, is not something that should have happened in the first place.\n\nYes, the Munich Games were a significant moment for the German company because that's where it launched the trefoil logo that became associated with Adidas until the 1990s when it rebranded with three stripes.\n\nBut for the rest of the world, the 1972 Olympics are mostly associated with one thing: The massacre that took place when eight Palestinian terrorists broke into the Olympic village, killed two victims and took nine hostages, who were all killed during a failed rescue attempt.\n\nIt's by far the worst moment in the history of the Olympics. More than five decades later, it remains an outrage.\n\nAdidas may be a German company that is proud of its Olympic heritage, but the 1972 Games do not need to be commemorated with a retro marketing campaign linking Munich to Paris. They shouldn't be commoditized for Adidas' profits. They should be remembered as the historic security failure that they were and a horrible but necessary reminder that the dangers faced by Israelis do not necessarily end at their borders.\n\nSecond, it's completely outrageous that Adidas chose model Bella Hadid to be the face of their advertisements for the shoe. Hadid, 27, is an American whose father, Mohamed, was born in Nazareth but whose family fled to Syria during the war that immediately followed Israel's statehood.\n\nThat history informs Hadid's pro-Palestinian views and her anger at the current situation in Gaza, which is both understandable and her right. But social media posts to her 61 million Instagram followers have also been filled with anti-Israel invective, false claims and antisemitic tropes. Last year, Bella's sister Gigi Hadid - also a model and social media influencer - was named one of three finalists for the Antisemite of the Year \"award\" by the StopAntisemitism watchdog group.\n\nIn other words, choosing someone who is famous on social media for being anti-Israel, at a time when much of the world is simmering in antisemitism and anti-Israel hate, to represent an ad campaign that reminds many people of the time when 11 Israelis were killed by terrorists at the Olympics ... well, it just doesn't really seem like a coincidence.\n\nOh, and by the way, Adidas was founded by Adolf Dassler - who joined the Nazi party in 1933 when Hitler rose to power. The modern-day company ended its association with Kanye West in 2022 after he made a raft of antisemitic comments, saying \"Adidas does not tolerate antisemitism and any other sort of hate speech.\"\n\nGiven the issues with West and Adidas' understanding that its historic Nazi associations would put the company under an even greater antisemitic microscope, you'd think its executives would be hyper-sensitive to any associations that could be construed as antisemitic.\n\nBut, at least in this case, you'd be wrong.\n\nAdidas' statement to media outlets acknowledged \"that connections have been made to tragic historical events - though these are completely unintentional - and we apologize for any upset or distress caused.\" The company promised to adjust the campaign moving forward.\n\nAs we head into an Olympics where the vulnerability of Israeli athletes is going to be impossible to ignore given the context of world events and France's unfortunate reality as a cauldron of antisemitism, the better move would be to drop it entirely.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

There are no happy memories from those games.\n\nAnd yet, the apparel company Adidas has decided in the runup to the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris to re-introduce their 1972 Olympic sneakers, launching an advertising campaign to promote the retro throwback shoes.\n\nAnd none other than Bella Hadid, a model who has made headlines for her outspoken defense of Hamas on social media, was chosen as the kicks' ambassador.\n\nHonestly, it was perhaps the perfect fit for a company founded by a Nazi.\n\nAdolf (\"Adi\") Dassler, a former member of the Nazi Party, formed Adidas in Germany in the aftermath of World War II.\n\nBut prior to that, Dassler made sports shoes that were embraced by Adolf Hitler, author Andrew Lapin has explained.\n\n\"During the infamous 1936 Berlin Olympic games, orchestrated by Hitler in an attempt to demonstrate Aryan athletic supremacy on the world stage, many of the German athletes sported Dassler shoes,\" Lapin wrote.\n\nIronically, the Munich games of 1972 were meant to cleanse the memory of Berlin 1936.\n\nNearly three decades after the Holocaust, West German authorities had worked hard to distance themselves from the country's Nazi past.\n\nYet today, a company that made its name at the 1936 Games is feeling nostalgic about the Olympics where Israelis were kidnapped and murdered for the crime of being Jews.\n\nAdidas' partnership with Hadid is perhaps as fitting as the one Adidas shared with another famous antisemitic spokesman, Kanye West.\n\nJust a few years ago, it took six days for Adidas to break its ties with West after he boasted on a podcast, \"I can literally say antisemitic s-t and they cannot drop me.\"\n\nHadid's well-documented eagerness to parrot Hamas' talking points long predated Adidas' partnership with the model.\n\nShe has repeatedly run PR propaganda for the terrorists still holding 120 souls hostage in Gaza, including eight Americans and two toddlers.\n\nLast month, following the heroic rescue of four Israeli hostages, Hadid posted a photo of former captive Almog Meir Jan, who survived for eight months on meager rations of pita bread.\n\nAs a form of psychological torture, Hamas delivered him a cake on his birthday, reminding him that he was spending this milestone in literal chains.\n\nHer post praised Hamas for making Meir Jan that cake -- neglecting to mention the beatings and torture he endured.\n\nIn 2021, Hadid shared a graphic asserting that Israel was not a country but a land settled by colonizers.\n\nShe deleted the post amid criticism -- and in its place shared a video of Sen. Bernie Sanders saying, \"It is not antisemitic to be critical of a right-wing government in Israel.\"\n\nBut Hadid wasn't being critical of the government of Israel -- she was being critical of the existence of the Jewish state itself.\n\nIn her mind, and in the minds of antisemites like her, Israel should not exist, and has no right to rescue its citizens taken hostage on Oct. 7, the most deadly day for Jews since the Holocaust.\n\nAdidas' \"decision continues to raise serious concerns about the company's commitment to moving on from their Nazi roots,\" the organization StopAntisemitism told me.\n\nOn Thursday, following an initial burst of criticism, Adidas tried to backtrack on Hadid's hiring.\n\n\"We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events -- though these are completely unintentional,\" the company announced, saying it would \"revise\" its ad campaign. Adidas did not clarify what that revision would entail.\n\nHadid and Adidas deserve each other.\n\nAnd loud and proud antisemites have a new shoe to proclaim their Jew-hatred, in bright red -- perfectly matching the Jewish blood that ran through the streets of Munich in 1972.\n\nRetro, indeed.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [],

In some circles, their mere presence at the world's biggest sporting event will make them pariahs -- and potentially targets.\n\nIsraeli athletes at the Paris Games are going to have it hard enough. They don't need one of the most iconic brands in sports joining the antisemitism pile-on.\n\nWhat Adidas did this week in launching its SL 72 sneaker -- and putting a famous anti-Israel propagandist at the front of its marketing campaign -- is an outrage.\n\nIt was also a choice, and one that neither Israelis nor Jews around the world should ever forgive.\n\nMistakes happen in marketing, even in large conglomerates with layers of public relations experts. But this kind of corporate provocation is so bizarre and so obviously inappropriate that the logical conclusion to be drawn is that Adidas wanted to make some kind of sick, twisted statement that flies in the face of everything the Olympics are supposed to represent.\n\nFirst of all, Adidas relaunching the original SL 72 sneaker, which debuted at the 1972 Olympics, is not something that should have happened in the first place.\n\nYes, the Munich Games were a significant moment for the German company because that's where it launched the trefoil logo that became associated with Adidas until the 1990s when it rebranded with three stripes.\n\nBut for the rest of the world, the 1972 Olympics are mostly associated with one thing: The massacre that took place when eight Palestinian terrorists broke into the Olympic village, killed two victims and took nine hostages, who were all killed during a failed rescue attempt.\n\nIt's by far the worst moment in the history of the Olympics. More than five decades later, it remains an outrage.\n\nAdidas may be a German company that is proud of its Olympic heritage, but the 1972 Games do not need to be commemorated with a retro marketing campaign linking Munich to Paris. They shouldn't be commoditized for Adidas' profits. They should be remembered as the historic security failure that they were and a horrible but necessary reminder that the dangers faced by Israelis do not necessarily end at their borders.\n\nSecond, it's completely outrageous that Adidas chose model Bella Hadid to be the face of their advertisements for the shoe. Hadid, 27, is an American whose father Mohamed was born in Nazareth but whose family fled to Syria during the war that immediately followed Israel's statehood.\n\nThat history informs Hadid's pro-Palestinian views and her anger at the current situation in Gaza, which is both understandable and her right. But social media posts to her 61 million Instagram followers have also been filled with anti-Israel invective, false claims and antisemitic tropes. Last year, Bella's sister Gigi Hadid - also a model and social media influencer - was named one of three finalists for the Antisemite of the Year \"award\" by the StopAntisemitism watchdog group.\n\nIn other words, choosing someone who is famous on social media for being anti-Israel, at a time when much of the world is simmering in antisemitism and anti-Israel hate, to represent an ad campaign that reminds many people of the time when 11 Israelis were killed by terrorists at the Olympics ... well, it just doesn't really seem like a coincidence.\n\nOh, and by the way, Adidas was founded by Adolf Dassler - who joined the Nazi party in 1933 when Hitler rose to power. The modern-day company ended its association with Kanye West in 2022 after he made a raft of antisemitic comments, saying \"Adidas does not tolerate antisemitism and any other sort of hate speech.\"\n\nGiven the issues with West and Adidas' understanding that its historic Nazi associations would put the company under an even greater antisemitic microscope, you'd think its executives would be hyper-sensitive to any associations that could be construed as antisemitic.\n\nBut, at least in this case, you'd be wrong.\n\nAdidas' statement to media outlets acknowledged \"that connections have been made to tragic historical events - though these are completely unintentional - and we apologize for any upset or distress caused.\" The company promised to adjust the campaign moving forward.\n\nAs we head into an Olympics where the vulnerability of Israeli athletes is going to be impossible to ignore given the context of world events and France's unfortunate reality as a cauldron of antisemitism, the better move would be to drop it entirely.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The company chose Hadid as the face of its SL72 campaign, commemorating the 52nd anniversary of the Munich Olympics by reviving a classic sneaker from the 70s. However, the 1972 Munich Olympics were overshadowed by a terrorist attack that resulted in the deaths of 11 Israeli athletes and one German police officer by the Palestinian militant group Black September.\n\nHadid, who identifies as a \"proud Palestinian,\" has drawn criticism due to her anti-Israel views, which are seen as particularly sensitive given the anniversary of the 1972 Munich massacre. Following the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, Hadid's support for Palestinian relief efforts has been scrutinized. The Israeli government's official social media account questioned Adidas' choice, citing Hadid's history of antisemitic remarks and calls for violence against Israelis and Jews.\n\nThe American Jewish Committee also condemned the campaign, labeling it as either a significant oversight or intentionally provocative, and called on Adidas to address the issue.\n\nHadid recently honored her Palestinian heritage at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival by wearing a dress made from keffiyeh fabric, a symbol of Palestinian solidarity. Reports in June indicated that Bella and her sister Gigi planned to donate $1 million to Palestinian relief efforts, with some funds potentially going to the UN's UNRWA agency, which has been previously linked to Hamas employees.\n\nOther celebrities featured in the ad campaign include French soccer star Jules Kound\u00e9, rapper A$AP Nast, musician Melissa Bon, and model Sabrina Lan.\n\nBella's father, Mohamed Anwar Hadid, has been vocal about Palestinian rights. Earlier this year, he apologized after criticizing New York Congressman Ritchie Torres for his pro-Israel stance.\n\nWhat was the September 5 attack?\n\nThe Munich massacre was a terrorist attack that occurred during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany. On September 5, members of the Palestinian terrorist group Black September infiltrated the Olympic Village, taking 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team hostage. The attackers demanded the release of 234 prisoners held in Israeli jails and two German radicals. After a tense standoff, a botched rescue attempt by German authorities at a nearby airbase resulted in the deaths of all 11 Israeli hostages, five of the eight terrorists, and one German police officer. The event shocked the world and led to significant changes in Olympic security and international counterterrorism measures.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

This campaign has sparked significant controversy due to the history of the Munich Olympics, where eleven Israelis were murdered by Palestinian terrorists. The face of this campaign is Bella Hadid, a half-Palestinian model known for her outspoken anti-Israel hatred.\n\nHadid's involvement in the campaign has raised many eyebrows. The Palestinian-American model has appeared on a prominent billboard in Times Square, drawing even more attention to the campaign. Her high-visibility advertisement has intensified the debate over Adidas's choice of spokesperson, given her history of spreading antisemitism and calling for violence against Israelis and Jews.\n\nThe Munich Olympics are notoriously remembered for the tragic event where Palestinian terrorists killed 11 Israeli athletes. The association of the 1972 Olympics with such a dark chapter in history adds a layer of complexity to the current marketing campaign. Many critics find the decision to feature Hadid in this specific campaign to be particularly insensitive, considering her activism and the historical context.\n\nAdding to the controversy, Hadid and her father have frequently promoted blood libels and antisemitic conspiracies against Jews. This new campaign comes after Adidas's history of controversial associations, including being founded by Nazi Adolf Dassler and maintaining a long-term partnership with Kanye West despite his antisemitic remarks.

Two athletes were murdered and another nine taken hostage were later massacred during a failed rescue attempt.\n\nA spokesperson for Adidas told Jewish News: \"The adidas Originals SL72 campaign unites a broad range of partners to celebrate our lightweight running shoe, designed more than 50 years ago and worn in sport and culture around the world.\n\n\"We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events - though these are completely unintentional - and we apologize for any upset or distress caused.

This event is a somber chapter in Olympic history and a painful memory for many around the world, particularly the families and friends of the victims, as well as the broader Jewish community.\"\n\nRomano adds that choosing 1972 as a focal point for their campaign without acknowledging the tragedy is, in her view, \"insensitive and distressing. Furthermore, Bella Hadid's public stance on certain political issues adds another layer of complexity, which can be seen as controversial given the historical context of 1972.\n\n\"I believe that companies like Adidas, which have a global influence, bear a responsibility to be mindful of historical contexts and the potential implications of their marketing decisions. I urge you to reconsider the campaign and find a more appropriate way to honor the legacy of your brand without inadvertently causing pain or controversy.\"\n\nThe shoe has been featured in magazines Vogue and Dazed and Confused.\n\nIt's not the first controversy for the global sports brand.

But it was a little skeevy to package them that way, given that the first thing that comes to mind about the 1972 Munich Olympics was the monstrous attack on Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists.\n\nAt that Olympics, 11 Israeli athletes were murdered in gruesome ways by hooded \"Black September\" terrorists, dancing around and waving their guns up and down as if it were Oct. 7. After that, the feckless German response ensured that the terrorists got away with it, escaping, until the long arm of the Mossad caught up to them and picked them off one by one.\n\nNevertheless the Munich shoe was a popular design and even Jewish-American athletic swimming champion, Mark Spitz, wore the shoes at those games. It wasn't wrong to bring them back, actually, the issue was the framing. The shoes sport a fabulous retro look that appeals to the young.\n\nThe big problem is who they chose as the marketing face to promote them: Bella Hadid, a loudly, militantly, anti-Israel supermodel who frequently wears a keffiyeh, and has a famously Jew-hating Palestinian dad, as if there weren't enough supermodels out there to choose from.\n\nAdidas has sparked outrage for choosing anti-Israel supermodel Bella Hadid to market its re-released retro 1972 Olympic sneakers -- the same year 11 Israeli athletes and coaches were killed by a Palestinian terrorist group at the Munich games.\n\nHadid, who is half-Palestinian on her father's side, and her sister Gigi have faced criticism for being supporters of the Palestinian relief efforts since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\nThe German athletic wear company announced Monday the re-launch of the classic SL 72 shoe ahead of the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris.\n\nHadid seems more malevolent than the average Hollywood celebrity airhead.\n\nShe's not only outspoken about supporting the Hamas cause, she's a reliable spreader of Hamas propaganda, all of it false:\n\nThe Post reports that she has advocated violence against Jews and Israel, which if true, would make the matter even worse. This would be a full-blown Jew-hater of the worst sort.\n\nNow she's the glamour face of those shoes, done in blood red as if to get the point across about the 1972 Olympics, and everyone's supposed to be fine with it.\n\nWhat indeed were they thinking?\n\nSure, Adidas, a German company that would remember those Olympics well, did a semi-apology for it, as TMZ and others reported:\n\nAdidas says ... \"We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events - though these are completely unintentional - and we apologize for any upset or distress caused. As a result we are revising the remainder of the campaign.\"\n\nBut it's pretty lightweight, acting as if the choice of model was some random accident.\n\nThey didn't think of the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre, the work of Palestinian terrorists? They didn't think of Hadid's loudly pro-Hamas advocacy? They didn't put two and two together and total up a potential boycott? One wonders if they just wanted the negative publicity or something like it.\n\nAnd the ignorance is inexcusable. Adidas, recall, is a company founded by a militant Nazi, Adi (short for Adolf) Dassler, who signed his letters \"Heil, Hitler\" and who had a brother who was an even bigger Nazi who eventually founded his own shoe business, Puma. A summarized history can be read here.\n\nNazis are the chief inspiration for Hamas, which makes this whole tennis shoe controversy pretty multi-layered and shocking.\n\nA little thought could have gone into the choice of model and the focus would have been on the shoes, not the disgusting past of Adidas's founder and the disgusting acts of its latest spokesmodel. It's as if the company's Inner Nazi is coming out.\n\nThey need a bigger apology than the one they gave, along with an explanation about whether this is their style of business to promote Naziism in all its most modern forms, or they really are so stupid they pay no attention to their own history.", "source": {"uri": "americanthinker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Thinker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_pentathlon_at_the_1972_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Modern pentathlon at the 1972 Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermodel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supermodel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Hadid", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bella Hadid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black September Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Spitz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Spitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mossad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keffiyeh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keffiyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puma_(brand)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puma (brand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Munich massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adolf Hitler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images.americanthinker.com/ml/mlvisuapz6vuvn8vnleg_800.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744770", "eventUri": "eng-9744770", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 622, "textEnd": 628}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Campaign images showing Hadid promoting the SL 72 have disappeared from social media. Other images showing Adidas brand ambassadors including French footballer Jules Kound\u00e9, US rapper A$AP Nast and Chinese model Sabrina Lan were still online.\n\n\"We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events -- though these are completely unintentional -- and we apologize for any upset or distress caused,\" Adidas said in a statement.\n\nThe SL 72, originally launched as a lightweight running shoe in 1972, is one of several models that underpin Adidas's commercial revival over the past year as the brand attempts to move on from a crisis involving US rapper Kanye West.\n\nIt raised its profit guidance for the second time this week and its shares have outperformed US rival Nike this year as new versions of legacy models such as the Samba and the Gazelle have turned into fashion icons.\n\nAdidas ditched its highly successful partnership with West in 2022 over a series of antisemitic remarks, suffering millions of euros in losses from lost sales of its fast-growing and high-margin brand Yeezy. Chief executive Bj\u00f8rn Gulden later made headlines when he claimed in a podcast that West -- also known as Ye -- \"did not mean what he said\" and was not \"a bad person\".\n\nGulden later apologised for his remarks, stressing that he did not want to defend West's behaviour. Adidas has promised to donate parts of the proceeds generated from its remaining stock of Yeezy shoes to groups that fight antisemitism and hate speech.\n\nA modelling agency representing Hadid did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn October 2022, in an apparent response to controversial remarks by West, she wrote that \"there are people that I love in the world, people that happen to be Jewish, that feel scared by the words that have been used\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009To my Jewish loved ones, the Jewish communities worldwide, I am here to say that you belong, you are worthy and your right as a human being is to be ALIVE.

Bella Hadid Due To 'Unintentional' Reference To The 1972 Olympics", "body": "Adidas had to backtrack and relook at their most recent ad campaign that featured Bella Hadid after criticism sparked.\n\nThe professional shot showed the 27-year-old model dressed in a white fuzzy top and matching shorts in which both were adorned with the company's iconic three striped lines in navy blue. Aside from the cozy outfits, she held a bouquet of red flowers in her hands that lay above her ankles where her red Adidas sneakers and white socks showed off.\n\nThe idea behind this snap was to capture the classic sneakers that were inspired by the 52nd Munich Olympics that took place in the 70s. Now this is where it caused a spark within its consumers, during the 1972 Summer Games where a terrorist attack took place - a Palestinian militant group killed a German police officer and 11 Israeli athletes.\n\nThe part Palestinian model shared an Instagram post of her with the ad campaign spotted in a big billboard in the background. This led many to leave their unapproved comments on her post.\n\nAnother online user noted, \"shame on Adidas ! #BoycottBella.\"\n\nWhile some were against the runway model, others opted to show their support: \"All if you in the comments criticising a PALESTINIAN woman who has done more for [Palestine Flag emoji] than any of you could in 5 lifetimes over, you all think you know better but you're part of the problem.\"\n\n\"SUPPORT BELLA,\" someone else chimed in.\n\nThe \"unintential\" reference- as Adidas stated, recircles to current events like the Israel-Hamas war. Bella spoke out about the ongoing war in a statement shared on her Instagram, \"My heart is bleeding with pain from the trauma I am seeing unfold, as well as the generational trauma of my Palestinian blood... I mourn with all the mothers who have lost children and the children who cry alone, all the lost fathers, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunties, friends that will never again walk this earth.\"\n\nThe well-known active wear brand released a statement on Thursday, July 18, that noted, \"We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events -- though these are completely unintentional -- and we apologize for any upset or distress caused...As a result we are revising the remainder of the campaign. We believe in sport as a unifying force around the world and will continue our efforts to champion diversity and equality in everything we do.\"", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodlife.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hollywood Life"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_acosta@hollywoodlife.com", "name": "Jessica Acosta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sneakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Hadid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bella Hadid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Munich massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Short film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Model (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "German language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportswear", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sportswear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "News"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2162260550_e0c353-e1721405631473.jpg?quality=100&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744770", "eventUri": "eng-9744770", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 1968, "textEnd": 1975}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Black September's Munich massacre.\n\nAbsolutely anything else that the 1972 edition of the Olympics was witness to, stands sorely overshadowed to date by the ghastly Munich massacre. On September 5, 8 members from the Palestinian militant organisation Black September, took 11 Israelis hostage after breaking into the Olympic village. The hostages included athletes, coaches and officials of Israeli origin.\n\n2 of the hostages were massacred almost instantly post some resistance, giving way to a nearly 18 hour-long standoff. The meticulously planned nature of the massacre was evident owing to the fact that towards the latter half of the standoff, the Black September militants in tow with the remaining 9 hostages managed to board a helicopter at the military airport of Furstenfeldbruck. An ambush was attempted by the German authorities followed by a failed rescue attempt, which led to 4 of the hostages being shot and reduced to ashes when one of the Black September militants detonated a grenade inside the helicopter. The remaining 5 hostages too lost their lives at gun point shortly after.\n\nOn the terrorist end, 5 of the 8 Black September militants died mid-mission. The remaining 3 were arrested, but soon let go of by the West German government in exchange of the hijacked Lufthansa Flight 615. For context, the flight was being used to transfer the 3 militants but was also hijacked. The decision was taken keeping in mind the well-being of the remaining passengers and crew on the flight. 2 of the 3 militants were eventually tracked down and assassinated by Israel's national intelligence agency, Mossad. The sole survivor of the original 8, is still alive to date, reportedly living in an African country with his wife and 2 children.\n\nThe Olympic games, obviously brought to a halt owing to the standoff and all that ensued, was eventually resumed with a slight delay, at the behest of the then-International Olympic Committee president, Avery Brundage, because \"the Games must go on\".\n\nIf you weren't already up to speed with this detail, Adidas does in fact have 'Nazi roots'. Adidas was founded in August 1949 in post-World War II Germany, by Adolf Dassler, a cobbler, inventor and businessman. Dassler was also a member of the Nazi party. While this big-little detail did not quite stop Adidas' steady and undeniable ascent to worldwide domination, the Nazi connect only adds another uncomfortable layer to the issue at hand.\n\nIf you're wondering how exactly this Nazi angle actually fits into the Israel-Palestine-Bella Hadid fiasco, the answer is quite straightforward. While the horrifying legacy of the Germans and the Jews is a separate history lesson than the Israel-Palestine conflict currently underway, both have antisemitism as a core theme.\n\nTo further simplify everything that is going on, Bella, owing to her partially Palestinian lineage, has very vocally been advocating for the freedom of Palestine. This directly flies in the face of the mainstream support coming Israel's way. While everyone is of course entitled to their opinion and their own understanding of this complicated and painful chapter in history, still evolving to-date given the never-ending violence, Adidas has messed up big time. Why? They chose to commemorate the 1972 Olympics, an edition hallmarked by the helpless massacre of Israelis on German territory -- with a globally famous part-Palestinian model and part-time activist as the face -- against a backdrop of red. It couldn't possibly be worse than this.\n\nTo make Bella's stance clearer, she herself comes from a line of Palestinian refugees, who were victims of 1948's Nabka, the violent ethnic cleansing of over 750,000 Palestinians at the hands of organised Zionist paramilitary forces.\n\nBella's vociferous pro-Palestine stance has both, found its allies as well as painted a flaming hot target on her back for those in favour of Israel. While Bella has always been pro-Palestine and has also managed to build a significantly successful career despite it, her political stance in the face of the still raging Israel-Palestine conflict, will, for better or for worse, naturally have a bearing on her professional footprint.\n\nAdidas has now apologised in an official statement to The Washington Times. Spokesperson Stefan Pursche said, \"We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events -- though these are completely unintentional -- and we apologize for any upset or distress caused. We believe in sport as a unifying force around the world and will continue our efforts to champion diversity and equality in everything we do\".\n\nDo you think this was a big slip by Adidas, or a part of intentional propaganda?", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Black September"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Munich massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_hijacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft hijacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grenade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Dassler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adolf Dassler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avery_Brundage", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Avery Brundage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mossad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestine (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethnic cleansing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/07/19/1600x900/Bella_Hadid_and_Adidas_1721390518481_1721390518722.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744770", "eventUri": "eng-9744770", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-05", "textStart": 215, "textEnd": 226}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

Hadid was not immediately available for comment.\n\nWhen Hadid appeared on the cover of Vogue magazine in 2021, she said on Instagram: \"I won't stop talking about the systematic oppression, pain and humility that Palestinians face on a regular basis.\" She has since continued to vocally support Palestinians and criticize the Israeli government.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war continues to spur a divide in Hollywood and among influencers over how to respond to the conflict, with prominent public figures facing backlash over their views.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Hadid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bella Hadid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black September Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Munich massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannes"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cannes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240720-bella-hadid-adidas-ch-1128-510538.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744770", "eventUri": "eng-9744770", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-23", "textStart": 15, "textEnd": 21}], "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 459186979, "relevance": 2}

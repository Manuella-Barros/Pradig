The group, who summoned an emergency meeting of the 19 Northern States in Kano, worried that the sudden return of the dethroned Emir Bayero to Kano after packing his belongings was cooked to ignite serious civil unrest in the city. The National Chairman of the Group, Sani Muhamud Darma, said while reading the communique of the meeting, Saturday in Kano, that, \"Aminu Ado Bayero's actions have clearly negated the tradition of the Emirate Council which he belongs to\". He reminded Bayero that history would never be kind to him if he stood as the source of uncertainty and chaos which might consume many lives in the State. He said, \"Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero, the dethroned Emir of Kano, should remember that the same person he is challenging today vacated the same seat for him and even be disappeared far away from Kano, but he accepted what happened in good faith without causing any uproar, why are you not replicating his actions?\" Darma said Aminu Ado Bayero should borrow a leaf from his siblings and even his very close brother, the Emir of Bichi, Nasiru Ado Bayero, for quietly vacating Kano and without making anything that will jeopardize peace. \"Beautifully, look at the Emir of Bichi and other Emirs, nobody heard anything from them, they respectfully left and vacated their thrones without causing any havoc, that is a clear love for Kano,\" the Chairman added. \"We are totally against the ill-advised actions of the dethroned Emir Aminu Ado Bayero, we strongly advise him to, as a matter of urgency, relocate and if he has any reservations of what had happened, he should channel it appropriately from wherever he is, but not Kano\". The Arewa Social Contract Initiatives reminded him that when Governor Abba Kabir Yusuf was campaigning he had promised Kano people that if elected he would change the narratives of Kano Emirates from what he believes is a distortion to where it was before the creation of the additional Emirs. \"And here is the Governor fulfilling his campaign promises, no wonder Kano people are so calm and happy with the development, as you move around one will see nothing has changed, people are happily going about their normal businesses,\" Darma said. He added, \"somebody cannot sit in Abuja or wherever and decide the fate of Kano, the fact that Kano, with its attendant volatility, remained peaceful and calm, clearly shows that Emir Sanusi is being accepted wholly. \"For this, we are advising Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero not to buy the idea of plunging Kano into chaos, his actions right now shows that he is hovering a personal desire at the detriment of Kano peace and stability.\"", "summary": "<img width=\"2160\" height=\"1441\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Collage-Maker-05-Aug-2022-04.58-PM.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Collage-Maker-05-Aug-2022-04.58-PM.jpg 2160w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Collage-Maker-05-Aug-2022-04.58-PM-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Collage-Maker-05-Aug-2022-04.58-PM-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Collage-Maker-05-Aug-2022-04.58-PM-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Collage-Maker-05-Aug-2022-04.58-PM-2048x1366.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2160px) 100vw, 2160px\" /><p>The Arewa Social Contract Initiatives, a Non Governmental Organisation, has charged the dethroned Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado Bayero, to vacate the ancient city in th", "url": "https://dailypost.ng/2024/05/26/vacate-kano-now-for-peace-to-reign-group-charges-dethroned-emir-bayero/", "image": "https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Collage-Maker-05-Aug-2022-04.58-PM.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:51:53", "author": "Muhammad Bukar", "authors": ["Muhammad Bukar"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ng", "sentiment": -0.315}

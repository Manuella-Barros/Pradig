Mike Perry: Odds, Records, Prediction", "body": "While Jake Paul is the best YouTube star to ever lace up a pair of boxing gloves, his opponent on Saturday, Mike Perry, is one of the best bare knuckle boxers to ever, um, not lace up a pair of gloves. What happens when the two face off on Saturday night in their eight-round fight (that features gloves)? The odds say Paul will win, but Perry thinks his bare knuckle experience will lead him to the upset. Here's everything you need to know about Jake Paul vs. Mike Perry, including the odds, their records and a prediction on who will win.\n\nOriginally, Paul was supposed to face Hall of Famer Mike Tyson tonight, but after Tyson recently dealt with ulcer issues, Paul tapped Perry to take his place.\n\nIt's unclear how much of a threat Perry holds to Paul. But Perry has made quite a name for himself in combat sports. He was a decent but not great MMA fighter, but his stock rose when he began fighting for the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship (BKFC) promotion.\n\nIn the short time that BKFC has existed, Perry is its biggest superstar and perhaps the best fighter in that combat sports niche. How that experience will compare when he faces Paul in an actual boxing match with gloves is unclear. But the 32-year-old Perry is excited to see what happens.\n\n\"I worked so hard for this,\" he told CBS Sports. \"This is not just another day in the office for me. I thrive off of the pressure. I live for this. I have been getting paid millions of bucks fighting people. I have been doing this a long time so this money fight ain't nothing new to me. I need $20 million. I ain't got enough yet. I've got to check that off my box list and get my mansion and my yacht and bring my family on the boat every day.\"\n\nApparently, Tyson is concerned with Paul's chances of winning. If Paul were to lose, how would that affect his new date to meet Tyson in November? It certainly wouldn't help the buildup, and even Paul admits that it could cost him the chance to get Tyson in the ring altogether.\n\n\"(Tyson) was concerned about me taking this fight,\" Paul said, via USA Today. \"He's like, 'What is Jake thinking? This guy Mike Perry is a killer.' So, he had some concerns. But Tyson, my message to you is don't worry. I'm going to put this guy to sleep. This is a Mike appetizer and you're next.\"\n\nEither way, UFC analyst Dan Hardy said Paul should beware.\n\n\"It's a recipe for disaster for Jake Paul,\" Hardy told MMA Fighting. \"I'm really genuinely surprised that he's allowing Mike Perry to punch him, because Mike Perry is going to savor the opportunity . . .\n\n\"Mike Perry's an animal. He's an absolute barbarian, and he is made for striking sports. Anything where he doesn't have to worry about someone trying to hold onto him and take him down and make it a slow night for him, he is perfect . . . Mike Perry is there to eat your face, and you've got to be prepared for that kind of intensity.\"\n\nHere's more info on the Jake Paul vs. Mike Perry showdown that U.S. viewers can watch on PPV.com (no subscription required) for $64.99 beginning at 9 p.m. ET on Saturday.\n\nEven though some in the MMA community think Perry will destroy Paul, the oddsmakers don't share that view. Paul is the -500 betting favorite (bet $500 to win $100), while Perry is the +350 underdog (win $350 on a $100 wager. There's some value in grabbing Paul to win by stoppage at -120, and if recent history is any indication, I wouldn't mind taking Paul to win by KO/TKO in rounds 1-2 at +550. If you like Perry, maybe grab him to win by stoppage at +550.\n\nAfter losing a close split decision to Tommy Fury last year, Paul (9-1, 6 KOs) has won three in a row in the past 11 months. And two of those victories came against professional boxers Andre August and Ryan Bourland, who had a combined 27-3-1 before facing Paul. Paul knocked out both of them in the first round makes the case that, yes, Paul should be a considered a legitimate boxer.\n\nPerry (0-1) has almost no experience as a professional boxer who wears gloves in the ring. In his only fight, he was knocked out by Kenneth McNeil in 2015. But Perry has been successful in bare knuckle boxing, going 5-0 since February 2022. As an MMA fighter, he amassed a 14-8 record.\n\nMy BKFC knowledge is minimal, so I don't have a great feel for how dangerous Perry will be to Paul. But I know what Paul can do against a boxing neophyte -- he basically destroys them. If Perry were a huge threat to Paul, I'm not sure Paul would have picked him as a Tyson replacement. So, I'll go with Paul by stoppage in the second round.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare-knuckle_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bare-knuckle boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_glove", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing glove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMA_Fighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MMA Fighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hardy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hardy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_decision", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Split decision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Writers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Writers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/669a8ab4d56ac3490606e140/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

At least, that's what Paul has suggested. Whether that's true or not is still to be seen -- and entirely depends on whether Perry can pull the upset.\n\nThere is risk for Paul in taking this fight. to be sure. While Perry washed out of the UFC (after a promising start as a fan-friendly brawler) with a 3-7 record over his final 10 fights in the promotion, he has found new life as the premier star for Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship. Along with finding his way in BKFC, Perry has quell many of the personal demons that seemed to be leading his life in a disastrous direction.\n\nPerry has been able to find success, and a 5-0 record, in BKFC by mauling opponents with ungloved shots that have cut, swelled and otherwise maimed his opponents.\n\nStill, Paul has made quite a boxing career out of fighting former UFC fighters. While he has experimented with facing the occasional \"real boxer,\" defeating a few club fighters and losing a moderately controversial split decision against Tommy Fury, the bulk of Paul's meaningful fights have come against men like Tyron Woodley (twice), Ben Askren, Nate Diaz and Anderson Silva. Having now had years of dedicated boxing training, Paul has outworked and dropped all of those men who have entered on more or less a single dedicated boxing fight camp.\n\n\"To stay getting experience under the bright lights on my world, on my path to world championship. And that's what matters, is getting the experience under the bright lights,\" Paul said at the final press conference. \"And this is a Mike appetizer. Mike warm up, but they're both killers at the end of the day, and I do have to be sharp. He does have one punch knockout power that I do have to respect. But other than that, it's going to be easy.\"\n\nPaul has also taken advantage of being the larger man in those fights. While Paul has fought at the cruiserrweight limit, or at least at catchweights above the 175-pound light heavyweight limit in boxing, all of his former UFC opponents have been career welterweights (170 pounds) and middleweights (185) in the UFC, though Silva had a handful of fights at 205 pounds.\n\nLike those previous opponents, Perry was a welterweight in the UFC and has fought at 175 and 185 pounds in BKFC, being physically undersized at 185, though built perfectly for the bare-knuckle world.\n\n\"I'm doing it for everybody, for me, for the fans, for BKFC, for MMA, you know, just mainly for me, because I believe in myself and my boxing ability,\" Perry said. \"I'm a brawling boxing mug, so I'm ready to get in the ring with Jake and have some fun.\"\n\nPaul will have all the physical advantages heading into the fight, standing three inches taller, with a five-inch reach advantage and a considerable weight advantage for this 200-pound fight. The weight factor is exaggerated in this fight considering Paul had been bulking up to over 200 pounds for a heavyweight fight with Tyson, which was postponed after the 58-year-old Tyson suffered an ulcer flare-up and left Paul scrambling to find a replacement opponent to keep the July 20 date intact.\n\nThe undercard is fairly typical for a crossover boxing event with some former and current champions along with another former UFC fighter looking to make the jump. Undisputed women's featherweight champion Amanda Serrano is in action when she takes on Stevie Morgan in the featured bout. Serrano was also expected to compete on the Tyson card in a rematch with undisputed two-division queen Katie Taylor. But with the postponement, Serrano wanted to stay active with a bout before November, especially after having her fight in March fall through on the day of the fight.\n\nPaul decided to take the risk of taking on Perry, who brings an aggression Paul has not faced yet in his boxing career. Now he has to navigate the choppy waters of an ultra-aggressive opponent who has found a nose for the big moment in recent years.\n\nPaul vs. Perry fight card, oddsJake Paul -425 vs. Mike Perry +300, cruiserweightAmanda Serrano -4000 vs. Stevie Morgan +1500, junior welterweightsAshton Sylve -295 vs. Lucas Bahdi +225, lightweightsShadasia Green -2500 vs. Natasha Spence +1100, super middleweights\n\nJulio Cesar Chavez Jr. -280 vs. Uriah Hall +215, cruiserweight\n\nPrediction\n\nWhile Perry is a legitimately dangerous opponent, it should be kept in mind that Paul and his team have been extremely careful in fight selection. There's clearly a reason Paul feels Perry is a good opponent heading into the Tyson fight. Maybe it's the size difference, maybe it's that they see Perry's reckless face-first fighting style and see an opponent that would be easy to pick apart and blast out with a big right hand. Whatever it is, Paul isn't taking whatever small risk there is of losing out of the Tyson fight by taking on someone he's afraid of fighting.\n\nPerry's power is a bit overstated at this point. The final 10 fights of his MMA career came without Perry scoring a stoppage. Though Perry has three straight TKO wins in BKFC, those have largely been the product of his bare-knuckle punches causing significant facial damage. In his most recent fight, Perry dropped 40-year-old Thiago Alves near the one-minute mark of the opening round and while Alves was able to beat the count, the fight was waived off as the referee didn't deem him fit to continue.\n\nAgainst a much larger man wearing much larger gloves, it's hard to see Perry getting the stoppage. And Perry's style is one that gets him hit as much, if not more, than he hits his opponents. It isn't hard to see Paul safely boxing his way to a decision win, especially with how boxing gloves will temper both Perry's power and allow Paul to block punches that Perry is used to connecting with in bare-knuckle and MMA. Rather than the decision, we're predicting Paul to get the stoppage, finding a good spot to get in with some big power shots as Perry tries to charge forward and apply his aggression.

At least, that's what Paul has suggested. Whether that's true or not is still to be seen -- and entirely depends on whether Perry can pull the upset.\n\nThere is risk for Paul in taking this fight. to be sure. While Perry washed out of the UFC (after a promising start as a fan-friendly brawler) with a 3-7 record over his final 10 fights in the promotion, he has found new life as the premier star for Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship. Along with finding his way in BKFC, Perry has quell many of the personal demons that seemed to be leading his life in a disastrous direction.\n\nPerry has been able to find success, and a 5-0 record, in BKFC by mauling opponents with ungloved shots that have cut, swelled and otherwise maimed his opponents.\n\nStill, Paul has made quite a boxing career out of fighting former UFC fighters. While he has experimented with facing the occasional \"real boxer,\" defeating a few club fighters and losing a moderately controversial split decision against Tommy Fury, the bulk of Paul's meaningful fights have come against men like Tyron Woodley (twice), Ben Askren, Nate Diaz and Anderson Silva. Having now had years of dedicated boxing training, Paul has outworked and dropped all of those men who have entered on more or less a single dedicated boxing fight camp.\n\nPaul has also taken advantage of being the larger man in those fights. While Paul has fought at the cruiserrweight limit, or at least at catchweights above the 175-pound light heavyweight limit in boxing, all of his former UFC opponents have been career welterweights (170 pounds) and middleweights (185) in the UFC, though Silva had a handful of fights at 205 pounds.\n\nLike those previous opponents, Perry was a welterweight in the UFC and has fought at 175 and 185 pounds in BKFC, being physically undersized at 185, though built perfectly for the bare-knuckle world.\n\nPaul will have all the physical advantages heading into the fight, standing three inches taller, with a five-inch reach advantage and a considerable weight advantage for this 200-pound fight. The weight factor is exaggerated in this fight considering Paul had been bulking up to over 200 pounds for a heavyweight fight with Tyson, which was postponed after the 58-year-old Tyson suffered an ulcer flare-up and left Paul scrambling to find a replacement opponent to keep the July 20 date intact.\n\nPaul decided to take the risk of taking on Perry, who brings an aggression Paul has not faced yet in his boxing career. Now he has to navigate the choppy waters of an ultra-aggressive opponent who has found a nose for the big moment in recent years.\n\nPaul vs. Perry fight card, oddsJake Paul -425 vs. Mike Perry +300, cruiserweightAmanda Serrano -4000 vs. Stevie Morgan +1500, junior welterweightsAshton Sylve -295 vs. Lucas Bahdi +225, lightweightsShadasia Green -2500 vs. Natasha Spence +1100, super middleweights\n\nJulio Cesar Chavez Jr. -280 vs. Uriah Hall +215, cruiserweight\n\nPrediction\n\nWhile Perry is a legitimately dangerous opponent, it should be kept in mind that Paul and his team have been extremely careful in fight selection. There's clearly a reason Paul feels Perry is a good opponent heading into the Tyson fight. Maybe it's the size difference, maybe it's that they see Perry's reckless face-first fighting style and see an opponent that would be easy to pick apart and blast out with a big right hand. Whatever it is, Paul isn't taking whatever small risk there is of losing out of the Tyson fight by taking on someone he's afraid of fighting.\n\nPerry's power is a bit overstated at this point. The final 10 fights of his MMA career came without Perry scoring a stoppage. Though Perry has three straight TKO wins in BKFC, those have largely been the product of his bare-knuckle punches causing significant facial damage. In his most recent fight, Perry dropped 40-year-old Thiago Alves near the one-minute mark of the opening round and while Alves was able to beat the count, the fight was waived off as the referee didn't deem him fit to continue.\n\nAgainst a much larger man wearing much larger gloves, it's hard to see Perry getting the stoppage. And Perry's style is one that gets him hit as much, if not more, than he hits his opponents. It isn't hard to see Paul safely boxing his way to a decision win, especially with how boxing gloves will temper both Perry's power and allow Paul to block punches that Perry is used to connecting with in bare-knuckle and MMA. Rather than the decision, we're predicting Paul to get the stoppage, finding a good spot to get in with some big power shots as Perry tries to charge forward and apply his aggression.

The \"Problem Child\" booked his biggest fight to date, when it was announced he would face off against legendary former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson on July 20 in Arlington, Texas.\n\nMore news: Jake Paul Reportedly Targeting MMA Debut in 2025\n\nThe issue is Tyson is 58 years old, and worries about his age and health came into question immediately after the fight was announced. To make matters worse, Tyson suffered a \"medical scare\" during a flight from Miami to Los Angeles in May.\n\nTyson apparently suffered an ulcer flare-up and had to be attended to by medical professionals when the flight landed. The result of the flare-up was that doctors told Tyson he could not train fully.\n\nThe scheduled bout between Tyson and Paul was then postponed from July 20 to Nov. 15. Instead of training harder, Paul found a new opponent for July 20.\n\nIt was announced that Paul would face off against former UFC and current undefeated BKFC (Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship) fighter Mike Perry. Perry is a dangerous striker and could be the biggest challenge to date for Paul.\n\nAs stated, Perry is undefeated in the BKFC. He has defeated former and current UFC fighters like Michael Page, Luke Rockhold, Eddie Alvarez, and Thiago Alves. Perry also holds a 14-8 MMA record, with notable wins over Mickey Gall, Alex Oliveira, and Paul Felder.\n\nPerry is known for his powerful striking. Though he has not yet tried his hand at professional boxing, his experience in the octagon and BKFC could spell trouble for Paul.\n\nPaul joined DAZN Boxing to talk about his fighting journey, and what kind of a threat Perry poses to him.\n\nAccording to Paul, \"A lot of people think I'm crazy for pivoting to this; why Mike Perry, why now, why take the risk, you could lose the biggest payday of your life against Mike Tyson if you lose to Mike Perry who is a violent killer, a bare-knuckle, undefeated legend over there. He takes punches like they're nothing, he's fast, athletic, he hits hard, he's a brawler, and I can't take that lightly. This whole thing is a risk, I'm focused on July 20, I'm focused on Mike Perry, and being in that mindset will lead me to victory.\"\n\nPaul is very self-aware of the fact that Perry is not a pushover in the sport of fighting. He is a renowned striker and a person that could easily knock Paul out.\n\nThe other important aspect of Paul's comments is he is risking a huge payday if he were to have to drop out of his fight with Tyson. No one has yet to fully damage or knock out Paul, but both of those could happen in his bout with Perry.\n\nThe boxing commission could step in and prevent Paul from fighting Tyson depending on the damage that he has sustained in his fight with Perry. This could be especially true if he were to get knocked out.\n\nMost fighters don't typically take fights within six months of being knocked out, for fear they could face another knockout. There is also the danger of being cut open and needing stitches to worry about.\n\nAgain, Perry is a violent striker and too much damage to Paul's face could also lead to the commission stepping in and preventing his fight with Tyson in November.\n\nPaul has only lost once in his professional boxing career, which was to Tommy Fury in Feb. 2023. The fight went in favor of Tommy by a split decision. Even then Paul was not damaged that much, so it stands to reason he should be able to hold his own against Perry.\n\nTime will tell if Perry gets the victory over Paul on July 20. Should this happen and Paul is knocked out or damaged in any extensive way, don't expect his fight with Tyson in November to go ahead.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_brizuela@newsweek.com", "name": "James Brizuela", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Oliveira", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Oliveira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Felder", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Felder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Gall", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mickey Gall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Alves_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Alves (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare-knuckle_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bare-knuckle boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Alvarez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Alvarez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Rockhold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Rockhold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAZN", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DAZN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_decision", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Split decision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Writers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Writers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2431657/jake-paul-mike-tyson.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=28b331102e771dbe98230810fb4b7722", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "dateEnd": "-11-15", "textStart": 860, "textEnd": 878}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 260, "textEnd": 267, "freq": 4}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Paul is the bookmakers' favourite to defeat Perry who is fighting in just his second professional boxing fight. Paul has already seen off the challenge of former UFC fighters Ben Askren, Tyron Woodley, Anderson Silva and Nate Diaz.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

And he ha said he will earn a similar amount tonight as he has for his fights with BKFC, around $600,000, but hopes to see that boosted by strong pay-per-view sales.\n\n\"It's not bad. It's right on cue with BKFC. Nothing crazy,\" he said. \"It depends, there are a lot of streamers out there. I'm hoping the pay-per-view does well and that people buy the show because DAZN be a little pricey out there sometimes. But we are out there working for that money so buy the event and I'll give you the fight you want to see, I'm going to do that regardless.\n\n\"The money is right there with BKFC with me and I've already established and set myself and my family up Now I can have fun, now I can enjoy the fight and put on a show and try to be the best 'Platinum' Mike Perry the world has ever seen.\"\n\nPaul is believed to have earned several million dollars for his last two fights, facile first-round knockouts of Andre August and Ryan Bourland.

Paul vs. Perry headlines a card featuring multiple boxing champions at the Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida on Saturday.\n\nPaul (9-1) looks to add another former UFC fighter to his resume after beating Nate Diaz, Anderson Silva, Tyron Woodley (twice) and Ben Askren. Mike Perry (0-1) is a heavy-handed mixed martial artist who revitalized his career with a 5-0 run in bare-knuckle boxing. Perry gives up size and boxing experience to Paul but he's among the most competent UFC alum available to challenge Paul in the squared circle. Paul is taking a substantial risk by fighting Perry four months before a major box office fight with Tyson.\n\n\"The skills is what pay the bills. And he has no footwork, no head movement, no defense,\" Paul said at the final press conference. \"He's a great offensive fighter and bare knuckle, but in terms of boxing, he's going to get picked apart very quickly, and it's going to be a short night. Like I said, my predictions are never wrong, so I stand on business every single time I manifested into reality. I Jake Joseph Paul will knock out Mike Perry in less than two rounds. It's going to happen, put money on it.\"\n\nThe undercard is fairly typical for a crossover boxing event with some former and current champions along with another former UFC fighter looking to make the jump. Undisputed women's featherweight champion Amanda Serrano is in action when she takes on Stevie Morgan in the featured bout. Serrano was also expected to compete on the Tyson card in a rematch with undisputed two-division queen Katie Taylor. But with the postponement, Serrano wanted to stay active with a bout before November, especially after having her fight in March fall through on the day of the fight.\n\n\"Listen, I don't pay attention to that. That doesn't win fights, that doesn't pay my bills. I go out, I train hard, I fight hard, and you'll see Saturday night,\" Serrano said. \"This is my 50th fight and I've never overlooked an opponent.\"\n\nBelow is the complete fight card for Paul vs. Perry along with the latest odds.

Eddie Hearn doubts Perry's chances against Paul due to his weight disadvantage and boxing experience, predicting a win for Paul. Despite Paul's victorious record against UFC fighters, Perry's focus on boxing and size advantage make him a formidable opponent.\n\nJake Paul returns to the boxing ring on Saturday, July 20, at the Amalie Arena, where he will face former UFC fighter and BKFC star Platinum Mike Perry.\n\nPerry stepped in to replace Mike Tyson, who was initially scheduled to fight Paul at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, TX, for Netflix's first-ever live sports event.\n\nTyson's illness led to the postponement of his match with Paul until November, prompting Perry's inclusion to keep the original date.\n\nRelated\n\nMike Perry Vows to 'Get Dirty' Against Jake Paul in Upcoming Fight\n\nMike Perry shares 'dirty' sparring footage, promises to use the same tactics in his Jake Paul fight.\n\nEddie Hearn Explains Why Mike Perry Will Lose To Jake Paul\n\nThe Matchroom Boss Puts It's Down To Size\n\nClose\n\nIn a recent interview with DAZN, Eddie Hearn expressed strong doubts about Perry's chances against Paul. \"Mike Perry is a welterweight who fought at middleweight in the UFC, and this fight is at 200 pounds. He has absolutely no chance,\" Hearn stated. He acknowledged Perry's toughness, especially at lower weights, but emphasized the significant weight disadvantage. Hearn added, \"Jake's not great, but he's big, strong, and can punch a little bit. I think he'll stop Mike Perry.\"\n\nHearn also commented on Paul's career trajectory, suggesting that the \"Jake Paul machine works when he's in a big fight.\" He noted that while there's some interest in Perry as an opponent, a fight with Mike Tyson if it happens, would draw much more attention. Hearn highlighted Paul's dilemma between seeking credibility as a boxer and participating in influencer fights for greater financial gain. \"He wants to establish himself as a credible boxer but can't fight anyone too good because he'll get beat,\" Hearn concluded.\n\nMike Perry Poses Serious Threat To Jake Paul\n\nJake Paul (9-1) seeks to add another former UFC fighter to his list of conquests, following victories over Nate Diaz, Anderson Silva, Tyron Woodley (twice), and Ben Askren. His opponent, Mike Perry (0-1), is a heavy-handed mixed martial artist who has revitalized his career with a 5-0 run in bare-knuckle boxing.\n\nDespite giving up size and boxing experience to Paul, Perry is considered one of the most competent UFC alumni available to challenge him in the ring. This bout presents a significant risk for Paul, especially with a major box office fight against Mike Tyson looming four months later.\n\nIn BKFC, Perry has defeated much larger opponents such as former UFC middleweight champion Luke Rockhold. Perry argued that he is different from other UFC fighters Paul has faced due to his focus on boxing since leaving the UFC in 2021.", "source": {"uri": "thesportster.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheSportster"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frank_yemi@thesportster.com", "name": "Frank Yemi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Hearn", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Hearn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalie_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amalie Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare-knuckle_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bare-knuckle boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AT&T Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matchroom_Sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matchroom Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middleweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAZN", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DAZN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Askren", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Askren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Rockhold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Rockhold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyron_Woodley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyron Woodley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anderson Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Diaz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nate Diaz"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Promotions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Promotions", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/jake-paul-vs-mike-perry.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 439, "textEnd": 446}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

I'm graduating before I beat your a** on Saturday.\"\n\nPaul and Perry began the press conference by responding to an incident at the public workouts on Wednesday night during which Perry punched Paul's deodorant mascot, dropping him to the canvas. Reacting to the punch, Paul said: \"It is what it is, he's going to have to pay for that on Saturday night. Thank you, Mike, for the promo, but on Saturday you're going to have to pay for that. He took out an employee with a body shot but Saturday night is when the truth and answers come out.\"\n\nPerry will be the fifth former MMA star to challenge Paul after Ben Askren, Tyron Woodley, Anderson Silva and Nate Diaz. All four failed to inflict defeat on the YouTuber and Perry said: \"I'm doing this for everyone; for mew, for the fans, for BKFC, for MMA, but just mainly for me because I believe in myself and my boxing ability.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martin_domin@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Martin Domin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare-knuckle_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bare-knuckle boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAZN", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DAZN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorado,_Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dorado, Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dorado, Puerto Rico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTuber", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTuber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Askren", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Askren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyron_Woodley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyron Woodley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anderson Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Diaz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nate Diaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mascot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mascot"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Writers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Writers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33277203.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screenshot-2024-07-18-at-201432.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Now, it's the king of influencer boxers Paul taking on BKFC's king of violence Perry. Paul's controversial matchup with Mike Tyson was rescheduled for Nov. 15, but will he even make it to that date once Perry is through with him? MMA Fighting's Shaun Al-Shatti, Alexander K. Lee, and Damon Martin take an all-angles look at Saturday's event, a matchup that could have far-reaching implications for both men.\n\nAl-Shatti: I suppose that depends on what we mean by dangerous.\n\nIf dangerous means \"the man most capable of sending Paul's head into orbit,\" there's a good argument to be made that both Tyron Woodley and Anderson Silva were far more accomplished knockout artists than Perry. If dangerous means \"the man most capable of beating Paul in a professional boxing match,\" Tommy Fury clearly takes that mantle considering, one, he's an actual professional boxer, and two, he actually defeated Paul in the squared circle. So in that regard, no, Perry doesn't stack up to some of the names already on Paul's r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nBut if we're talking about dangerous in a more abstract sense -- i.e. \"the total wildcard most capable of just doing really wild shit in there, and potentially teaching Paul a lesson about himself that he'd really rather not learn\" -- then good lord, absolutely, 100 percent, BKFC's King of Violence is the most dangerous man Paul has ever come across. Perry has already broken far tougher and more decorated men than Paul, he brings an inherent ferocity to any arena that few people on Earth can match -- and low-key, he has a knack for playing spoiler in situations where his skill set alone should realistically fall short. Just ask Michael Seals. As the great Charlie Kelly once showed, no one can ruin plans quicker than the wildcard.\n\nLee: Jake Paul has been in there with some kooky characters, but he's really rolling the dice getting in there with Mike Perry.\n\nOver the past couple of years, Perry has done a lot to change his image from a middling MMA welterweight with serious outside-of-the-cage issues (including domestic violence allegations raised by his ex-wife and his mother) to legitimate bare-knuckle boxing star. Whether you buy this rehabilitation is up to you, but there's no question that he's become a fan favorite and a big-enough name to be booked for this high-profile opportunity.\n\nPerry has retained the most important part of his act: When the bell rings, you're in for a hell of a show, and when it comes to his BKFC career, it's typically been at the expense of his opponents. Luke Rockhold. Eddie Alvarez. Thiago Alves. All of these former UFC standouts left the BKFC ring with a slightly different face shape than they had before they traded punches with Perry. I hope Paul subscribes to the \"chicks dig scars\" theory because he's likely to have a couple of new ones after this weekend, even with the big gloves in play.\n\nWin or lose, Perry goes in there to hurt, and he has more knockout power than anyone Paul has fought before. Sorry, Jake, this isn't going to be Tommy Fury pitter-pattering you to snooze-worthy decision loss. If you lose on Saturday, it will be because Perry checked that chin. Should that happen, there's no telling how much psychological damage that could do to Paul on top of the physical.\n\nMartin: Based on what we actually know about Jake Paul and the opponents he's faced, Mike Perry is by far the most dangerous for a few different reasons.\n\nWhen Paul first started touting himself as a future boxing champion, no one really knew what to expect. Beating up influencers on the undercard of your brother's events doesn't exactly tell us much. Flat-lining an NBA player like Nate Robinson shows you have knockout power, but that still doesn't mean you can box.\n\nPaul did pick up a number of wins over legitimately talented MMA fighters, but even those victories can be picked apart. Tyron Woodley is one the best welterweights of all-time, but he's a wrestler with knockout power. That certainly doesn't mean he's a boxer. Ben Askren is a wrestler with no hands. Anderson Silva was pushing 50 years old. Nate Diaz is a lightweight. You get the point.\n\nBut Mike Perry is actually in the prime of his fighting career at 32 years old and he's spent the past few years doing nothing but striking as a bare-knuckle boxing superstar at BKFC. Perry arguably has a better win on his record than Paul does -- as far as boxing is concerned -- when he beat Michael Seals in a special rule set match back in 2021.\n\nPerry is ferocious, powerful, and relentless in the ring, and he has the kind of \"I don't give a f*ck\" attitude that allows him the freedom to go head-hunting on Paul from the first second until the last. Could that potentially cost him? Of course. Perry often eats as many punches as he throws, but playing that game with him can (and usually does) end in disaster.\n\nIf Paul has dollar signs in his eyes waiting to beat up 58-year-old Mike Tyson in November, he might just get cashed out by a savage Perry come Saturday night.\n\nAl-Shatti: Not a chance.\n\nMuch like other \"Ultra Famous Dudes Who Also Fight\" -- i.e. the Conor McGregor category -- Paul's allure to the general audience isn't built on preserving the sanctity of some unblemished record. If it was, this whole saga would've ended 17 months ago once he lost to Tommy Fury. Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson is the type of fight Netflix wants because it's the type of fight that gets audiences young and old alike morbidly interested to watch the car crash. I guarantee you the grandfather shopping in the dairy aisle of the grocery store doesn't care if Mike Perry sends Paul to the land of wind and ghosts on Saturday, just as the 12-year-old who grew up indoctrinated in Paulmania doesn't care if Perry goes out there and Rockholds the YouTuber. The former likely won't even find out and the latter is going to continue riding-or-dying for their childhood hero regardless of what happens in Tampa.\n\nHell, if Paul actually does lose this weekend, it may actually boost interest from the endlessly vocal \"Tyson Has No Chance Because He's So Damn Old\" crowd.\n\nEither way, Paul's rabid fan base isn't going away and the spectacle of watching a near-mythical beast like Tyson do his thing while he's still around will remain as strong as ever.\n\nLee: It really could!\n\nLook, I get that there's been so much money and marketing muscle put into Paul vs. Tyson that it seems like the matchup will happen come hell or high water, even though it's unclear who is actually looking forward this accursed event at this point. But if there was ever an excuse for Paul to ask for a postponement, wouldn't a few brutal rounds with Perry be it?\n\nAdmittedly, there's probably not a lot of crossover between the people tuning in this Saturday and the people tuning in Nov. 15, but should Paul have a poor showing against Perry, word will get out. Not to mention the possibility of an unfortunate moment for Paul going viral. Imagine if Perry manages to land a shot that has Paul touching canvas. That will be replied a million times over the next four months and suddenly there's a whole new narrative heading into the Tyson fight.\n\nI'll go as far as to argue that Paul needs to not only beat Perry, he has to look good doing it. Your average, normal, non-combat sports obsessed human being has no clue who Perry is. If he ends up humbling Paul, it will be a massive blow to the 27-year-old's brand. Tyson vs. Paul will still draw massive interest, but it definitely loses some shine if Paul is coming off of a loss to a far less famous bare-knuckle boxer.\n\nMartin: It's tough to say, but really that decision ultimately lies with Netflix.\n\nThe streaming service is footing the bill to promote this bizarre boxing match between a social influencer and an aging legend who is much closer to being an octogenarian than he is a teenager. Weirdly, a compelling loss where Paul gets into a grueling war with a savage like Perry might actually convince a few more people that Tyson has a chance to beat him.\n\nThen again, Paul getting absolutely demolished and then turning around to fight again in November might be a tough stretch, so that's where the questions come in. So technically the answer is yes, it's possible that Perry costs Paul the fight with Tyson, but it seems unlikely.\n\nThrough 10 fights in his career, Paul's brand has been built around spectacle more than wins or losses. While he still references his split decision loss to Tommy Fury from time to time, that barely registers as a blip on Paul's radar these days.\n\nFor a guy who keeps touting his plan to win championships and beat up guys like Canelo Alvarez, Paul's real agenda involves taking on big names and cashing even bigger checks. The Tyson fight might lose some luster if Paul gets face-planted by Perry, but otherwise this matchup is more than likely moving ahead as scheduled.\n\nAl-Shatti: Mike Perry's bank account.\n\nFor real, not since Jorge Masvidal exploded into a superstar overnight in 2019 have we seen a financial transformation that compares to what Perry has undergone since leaving the UFC. This is a man who lost seven of his last 10 octagon bouts -- and suddenly, three years later, is a multi-millionaire with promotional juice for days and no end to this gold rush in sight. Let that be a lesson to us all. Sometimes the key to life really is just finding where you fit in the world rather than stubbornly trying to force a square peg to fit into a round hole.\n\nBut to answer the actual question, Paul wins a fight that's grimier than his usual but clearly shows the difference between the brutecraft of bare-knuckle boxing and the oh-so-sweet science of the big-gloved arts. Perry is going to bring the fight and test Paul's mettle in a way it's never been tested before, but ultimately the YouTuber will be too large and too long for the BKFC star. Expect Paul to get on his bike and jab his way to victory as the rounds wear on and those 10-ounce gloves protect him from the kind of facial reconstruction Perry's last few opponents have come to enjoy. Jake Paul via unanimous decision.\n\nLee: Paul.\n\nFor all the doomsaying I've written above, this should be a pit-stop on the way to Paul's more prestigious punch-up with Tyson in November. Perry has been saying a lot about how Paul has no concept of how different bare-knuckle boxing is, but I think Perry should consider that he's never been in a traditional boxing match with this kind of circus around it. Like it or not, he's in Paul's world now.\n\nJake Paul is, at best, an above average boxer relative to his level of experience, and that should still be enough to handle Perry. The size and athleticism of Paul have carried him through some tough spots and I don't expect that to change when he crosses swords with \"Platinum.\" Perry is wild, dangerous, and unpredictable, but does he have more surprises up his sleeve than a Nate Diaz or an Anderson Silva? Doubtful.\n\nIt's more likely that the always well-prepared Paul feasts on Perry's aggression, while wisely avoiding the taunts to \"bring it on\" that are sure to be peppered throughout the contest. Perry will do his best to make it nasty, but Paul won't bite.\n\nEventually, the larger Paul will lock in on Perry, pick up on a fatal tell, and take out the face of BKFC in the sixth round.\n\nMartin: On paper, Paul should win based on his overall experience in boxing and the ability to do just enough to cruise to victory as he did in past fights against guys like Silva and Diaz. Paul didn't take too many unnecessary risks against either of them but he did manage a brief knockdown in both to help him get the nod on the scorecards.\n\nJust for a moment, however, let's think about how Perry can pull off the upset.\n\nHe's a hard-charging bull with devastating knockout power in both hands and the grit and moxie to make this a slugfest. If Perry can lure his foe into the kind of fight where Paul can't dictate the pace and actually has to just stand and trade punches round after round, this becomes a much closer contest.\n\nPerry's aggressive style could easily cost him, especially with Paul carrying around a nuclear bomb in his right hand, but he presents problems the 27-year-old fighter from Cleveland just hasn't faced before. In his lone loss, Paul only had to deal with Tommy Fury dancing on the outside and sticking a jab in his face for eight rounds and not much else happened.\n\nThat's not going to happen with Perry. He's going to be in Paul's face from the first second until the last, and he'll be throwing heavy leather behind every punch. To add to that, Perry has always shown effective conditioning, even though he's constantly throwing heat-seeking missiles, but cardio has been a problem for Paul in the past.\n\nThat's why my pick is this being the night that Paul goes night-night, perhaps late in the seventh or eighth round just as Perry predicted.", "source": {"uri": "mmafighting.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MMA Fighting"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alexander_k_lee@mmafighting.com", "name": "Alexander K.

The chaos for the upcoming boxing match has already arrived, as the fighters engaged in their weigh-in and face-off on Friday. After sizing one another up, some shoving occurred, resulting in a massive brawl.\n\nMore news: Jake Paul Reportedly Targeting MMA Debut in 2025\n\nInitially, Paul pretends to protect himself at a distance from Perry, but the pair soon approach one another face-to-face. After multiple words are exchanged, Perry offers a little shove to Paul, who responds in kind with a bigger shove. The result is a brawl between security officials and both teams.\n\nThough Paul was the bigger aggressor with a bigger push, he immediately stepped back, and the brawl included security officials for both teams. Perry appears to be lost in the chaos as the big-bodied security guards attempt to calm things down.\n\nPaul was initially supposed to fight Mike Tyson on July 20, but a \"medical scare\" on a recent flight led to Tyson having to take some time off from training. Paul vs. Tyson was then postponed to Nov. 15.\n\nPaul could have easily taken some extra time to train, but the boxer instead decided to book a last-minute opponent in Perry. Paul has the benefit of his months-long training while getting ready for Tyson, and a bigger boxing resume.\n\nThat is not to say that Perry is any kind of slouch. He is one of the most dangerous strikers in MMA. After an up-and-down career with the UFC, Perry joined the BKFC (Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship). Perry instantly became a star in the promotion and has gone undefeated in his five fights there.\n\nPerry's notable wins have come against current and former UFC fighters like Luke Rockhold, Thiago Alves, and Eddie Alvarez.\n\nPaul understands the risk that comes with taking on a renowned striker like Perry. He stated to DAZN Boxing in a video that \"you could lose the biggest payday of your life against Mike Tyson if you lose to Mike Perry who is a violent killer, a bare-knuckle, undefeated legend over there.\"\n\nDespite the risks that both are facing, Paul and Perry will face off on Saturday. Based on the pair already attempting to fight one another at the weigh-in, the match itself could prove to be one of the most exciting fights in 2024.\n\nPaul is on a three-fight win streak in boxing, but could suffer his second career loss to Perry come Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_brizuela@newsweek.com", "name": "James Brizuela", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Alves_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Alves (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare-knuckle_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bare-knuckle boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Alvarez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Alvarez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Rockhold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Rockhold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAZN", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DAZN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Writers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Writers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2433218/boxer-jake-paul.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=d208c21c59778547af96cc844ff1fbe1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 51, "textEnd": 58, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-15", "textStart": 1128, "textEnd": 1135}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Paul vs. Perry headlines a card featuring multiple boxing champions at the Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida on Saturday.\n\nPaul (9-1) looks to add another former UFC fighter to his resume after beating Nate Diaz, Anderson Silva, Tyron Woodley (twice) and Ben Askren. Mike Perry (0-1) is a heavy-handed mixed martial artist who revitalized his career with a 5-0 run in bare-knuckle boxing. Perry gives up size and boxing experience to Paul but he's among the most competent UFC alum available to challenge Paul in the squared circle. Paul is taking a substantial risk by fighting Perry four months before a major box office fight with Tyson.\n\nUnified featherweight world champion Amanda Serrano and former WBC middleweight champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. are among the favorites on the card.

Their showdown tops the pay-per-view main Paul vs. Perry fight card (9 p.m. ET) from Amalie Arena in Tampa, Fla. Paul, who first gained fame as a YouTuber and child actor before pursuing boxing, was supposed to fight iconic former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson this weekend, but that fight was postponed because Tyson suffered a medical concern. Still wanting to remain active, Paul agreed to keep the date and instead fight Perry, a rugged former UFC fighter who is now the face of the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship promotion.\n\nPaul is a -500 favorite (risk $500 to win $100), while Perry is priced at +370 in the latest Jake Paul vs. Mike Perry odds. The over/under for total rounds completed is 6.5. Before locking in any Jake Paul vs. Mike Perry picks, make sure you check out the boxing predictions and betting advice from SportsLine combat sports expert Brandon Wise.\n\nWise, who is the combat sports editor for CBS Sports, is an experienced and successful boxing analyst. His SportsLine record has been stellar over the past four years and, in March, he called the win in Round 1 for Paul (+200) against journeyman pro Ryan Bourland and also advised SportsLine members to take the Under 1.5 rounds (+120). Anyone who has followed Wise's combat sports picks has seen massive returns.\n\nNow, with Jake Paul vs. Mike Perry on deck, Wise has studied the matchup from all angles and released a money-line pick and method-of-victory prop. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine.\n\nJake Paul vs. Mike Perry preview\n\nPerhaps the primary motivation for Paul lies in building or at least preserving public interest in his potential showdown with former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson in November. A loss, or perhaps even a win amid a lackluster performance, could potentially hurt the momentum for what would be the biggest crossover boxing match since the trend took hold.\n\nConversely, a win over Perry, who has a modicum of star power in the combat sports realm, could both bolster Paul's boxing resume and ignite interest in the Paul vs. Tyson fight in the months ahead of the bout. Paul said as much in a recent interview on the MMA Hour alongside Perry that basically served as the unofficial press kickoff for Saturday's fight.\n\n\"I've got to get my experience in the ring. I love going under the bright lights and putting on a show for the fans,\" Paul said. \"Mike Tyson is an absolute killer, so I do want to face another killer. I think Mike Perry is funny and entertaining ... but he is also a savage and I do respect him as a fighter. This can be a stepping stone in the right direction.\" See who to pick here.\n\nHow to make Jake Paul vs. Mike Perry picks\n\nWise likes the Under on total rounds and also has confident money-line and prop picks for Jake Paul vs. Mike Perry. He's only sharing his picks and analysis at SportsLine.\n\nWho wins Jake Paul vs. Mike Perry, and which prop is a must-back?

Highlights from Jake Paul vs Mike Perry press conference ahead of boxing showdown in Florida", "body": "Highlights and best moments from the explosive press conference between Jake Paul and Mike Perry ahead of their boxing showdown this weekend.\n\nAfter a bitter war of words, both on social media and at the recent press conference, the stage is finally set for Jake 'The Problem Child' Paul and 'Platinum' Mike Perry to finally lock horns in the boxing ring.\n\nThe press conference started with Jake Paul actually thanking Mike Perry for 'beating up' his mascot at the open weigh-ins, claiming that the PR stunt only serves to market his new company, 'W'.\n\nIn turn, Perry exclaimed that he's going to finish Jake Paul for the various communities he represents in the world of combat sports; from Mixed Martial Arts all the way to Bare-Knuckle.\n\n\"I'm doing this for everybody, for me, for the fans, for BKFC, for MMA, just mainly for me because I believe in myself and my boxing ability - I'm a brawling, boxing mug so I'm ready to get in the ring with Jake and have some fun.\"\n\nYet the conversation quickly shifted to the comments made by one Conor McGregor, who certainly had some choice words for Paul as he held a BKFC press conference in Marbella only a few hours earlier.\n\n\"First of all, he's bigging up BKFC but you're going to see what I'm going to do to their best fighter on Saturday night, I'm going to embarrass the whole entire league. This guy has no skill, those are just brawler-idiot-street fighter dudes who have no idea what the sweet science is.\n\n\"Conor McGregor can say what he wants but he won't fight me either so once I knock out Mike Perry, Conor McGregor- let's run it, but you won't... Layoff the c******, get in the gym, start winning fights and then maybe we can start having a conversation.\"\n\nThat comment on BKFC immediately got the attention of Perry, who lambasted the crowd for clapping and cheering Jake's jibe: \"He's a disrespectful punk, those men and women fight for their families over there, they get in that ring, and they put on a show for the fans!\"\n\nContrary to popular belief, Perry isn't making his boxing debut on Saturday, having lost his only previous fight back in 2015; with Jake Paul stating that he's studied footage from that bout extremely closely:\n\n\"He had a boxing match in a triangle that I gained a lot of knowledge from, [he leaves] a lot of openings and it's going to be a short night. He's open for anything that I want to throw at him.\"\n\n\"But I've been winning since then,\" countered Perry, \"That's all I know, I've been victorious consistently and I've been getting better every single day to put this little twerp in his place - welcome, welcome, you just got here.\"\n\nThe pair then started the first of many arguments shouting over the top of each other; with Paul arguing that Perry should be considered the newcomer as he's 0-1 in boxing, whilst 'Platinum' pointed out that he's had over 30 professional fights.\n\n\"That's cool and I'm [still] going to beat you - isn't that crazy? I'm 0-1 but how many pro boxers have you fought? Two guys and the last one - ey, I'm glad you got your shirt open so everyone can see your fat a** belly - you're as fat as the last guy you knocked out and you barely knocked him out!\n\n\"Don't worry, you're going to get what you've been asking for - for the fight to go longer than one round; I'm going to give you hell in the first, second, just wait and watch... Then you're going to get tired and be grasping for air - I just made up a new word, grasping. You're going to be grasping for air.\"\n\nIrritated by Perry questioning his physique, Paul noted that he expects to weigh around 215lbs after rehydrating on Saturday evening, Perry in turn said he'll probably weigh in around 194-196lbs.\n\n\"That doesn't matter, none of that matters - skills are what pay the bills,\" noted Paul, adding that whilst Perry is a fantastic fighter when he's on the front foot in Bare-Knuckle, he lacks the necessary head movement and defense to survive 'The Problem Child'.\n\n\"He's going to get picked apart very quickly and it's going to be a short night. My predictions are never wrong, so I stand on business every time... I will knock out Mike Perry in less than two rounds, put some money on it.\"\n\n\"You got beat by Love Island boy,\" Perry interjected, referencing Paul's loss to Tommy Fury in 2023- \"Love Island boy beat you up and he ain't no killer and he [still] beat you up,\"\n\nIt was at this point when Paul brought out a 'gift' for his opponent, a graduation cap with 'Private School Perry' written on its top- Perry tossed it into the air and claimed victory, \"I never got to do this - I'm graduating before I beat your a** on Saturday!\"\n\nThe questions would then be opened up to the audience and let's just say that there were some interesting statements being floated around the Amalie Arena stage.\n\nThe pair then finally squared off in an intense moment in front of a rather subdued crowd.\n\nDespite having a rematch with Katie Taylor already booked for November 15, Amanda Serrano, one of the greatest female boxers of all time, returns to action to face 8-1 American Stevie Morgan.\n\nWhilst not many questions were directed their way, there was certainly some tension on stage between the two following comments that Morgan made about Serrano being one of the weaker fighters on the women's pound-for-pound rankings.\n\nAmanda Serrano: \"Listen, I don't pay attention to that, that doesn't win fights and that doesn't pay my bills, I go out, I train hard, I fight hard, and you'll see Saturday night.\"\n\nStevie Morgan: \"I'm not being disrespectful at all; I'm just stating facts. If I had to pick any of the fighters at the top, Amanda Serrano would be the one I would choose mainly because she's going to make me look good.\"\n\nThe full card for 'Fear No Man', the title of the event itself, includes the following fights:\n\nJake Paul vs Mike Perry goes down live from the Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida on July 20, exclusively on the DAZN PPV network.", "source": {"uri": "bloodyelbow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bloody Elbow"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_recording_certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Music recording certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Problem_Child", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Problem Child"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicity_stunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Publicity stunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mascot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mascot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbella", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marbella"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marbella"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punk rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fury", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Serrano", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amanda Serrano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalie_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amalie Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_for_pound", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound for pound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katie Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAZN", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DAZN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://bloodyelbow.com/wp-content/uploads/1/2024/07/MMA-TemplatesSport-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-15", "textStart": 4940, "textEnd": 4951}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 5888, "textEnd": 5895}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Perry was the first to put his hands on Paul but the internet sensation responded by shoving the bare knuckle bruiser so hard he disappeared off-camera. Despite Perry's fighting history in BKFC, Paul may hold the upper hand in strength and experience in boxing-rules contests.\n\nJake Paul and Mike Perry got into a shoving match on stage during a weigh-in just one day before their crossover, boxing-rules fight in Tampa, Florida, which airs on PPV.com.\n\nThough those in MMA circles are tipping Perry to provide Paul with a stern test, it will likely be business as usual for the internet sensation who took the boxing world by storm after feasting on pro athletes, former MMA champions, and a few journeyman boxers. The gulf in boxing-rules experience therefore favors Paul, despite the wild and fan-friendly fighting nature Perry has shown in his foray into the sport of bare knuckle, after a run in UFC.\n\nPaul may have an additional advantage heading into the fight, if pre-fight body language and weigh-in theatrics can be used to determine the probable outcome. This is because Paul showed he could be the naturally-stronger athlete heading into Saturday's showdown.\n\nRelated What Mike Perry is Wearing Around his Neck Ahead of Jake Paul Fight\n\nThis is what Mike Perry is wearing around his neck ahead of the Jake Paul fight in boxing.\n\nPaul Shoved Perry so Hard he Disappeared Off-Camera Perry laid his hands on Paul first, but came out second best\n\nWeigh-ins can often pass fight fans and media members by with little to no newsworthy events but every now and then they provide a promise of fireworks to come if there is any controversial trash-talk, or incidents in which one, or both, fighters lay their hands on one another.\n\nPerry was first to put his hands on Paul as he gave his opponent a slight push on the chest, to which Paul rapidly responded with a full on shove which pushed Perry so hard he disappeared off-camera. It was a wild indication that the 6-foot-1 Paul, who is three inches taller and, likely, at least 15 pounds heavier, may well be the naturally stronger athlete.\n\nWatch the pushing and shoving match right here:\n\nJake Paul Will Hope to Emerge Unscathed 'The Problem Child' has a big event to look forward to later this year\n\nPaul will hope to emerge unscathed against Perry, in a victory that would advance his pro boxing record to 10 wins (with 7 KOs should he secure the finish this weekend).\n\nThe more thrilling the win, the likelier it is that Paul will recapture some momentum he's lost as recent fights -- like the ones against Andre August and Ryan Bourland went under the radar.\n\nOn November 15 Paul is scheduled to fight Mike Tyson at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. It would be the biggest spectacle Paul has been involved, not just because of the grand stage at the Cowboys Stadium, but because Netflix is airing the show and the potential audience capture could be huge.\n\nPaul was supposed to box Tyson earlier in the summer but the veteran heavyweight withdrew due to health concerns.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare-knuckle_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bare-knuckle boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crossover (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trash_talk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trash talk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AT&T Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Writers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Writers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mixcollage-19-jul-2024-05-36-pm-4723.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-15", "textStart": 2767, "textEnd": 2778}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

The two came to blows on Friday night, as well, as the weigh-in nearly turned into a brawl before Saturday's showdown.\n\nAnd while Paul has dismissed Saturday's bout as a 'Mike appetizer' and 'Mike warmup,' press conference moderator and MMA aficionado Ariel Helwani reliably called Perry 'one of the toughest SOBs on the planet.' Now Perry has a chance to make a name for himself, not only by beating a wildly famous former YouTube star, but by putting that November 15 Paul-Tyson fight in jeopardy with a stunning upset: 'I'm a crazy [expletive] and I'm here to fight.'\n\nAn exasperated Jake Paul shuts his eyes as Mike Perry talks trash to the crowd in Tampa\n\nAfter serving as a backup fighter for two Paul bouts, Perry (right) gets his chance Saturday\n\nRead More Jake Paul SHOVES Mike Perry and sparks on-stage brawl as weigh-in descends into chaos\n\nA combat sports enthusiast and professional for the better part of the last decade, Perry's route to the top of this fight card isn't any more bizarre than Paul's.\n\nThat former Disney Channel star and YouTuber has made millions as an 'influencer' boxer and promoter, all without ever beating a recognizable pugilist - something his bout with Tyson was intended to remedy.\n\nPerry obviously doesn't have Tyson's boxing resume, but he does have other advantages over the Hall of Famer.\n\nSpecifically, Perry was born after the Lyndon Johnson administration, he hasn't qualified for AARP membership, and while he has only one other boxing match on his record - a knockout loss in 2015 - he does have a dangerous reputation on the bareknuckle circuit, where he's 5-0.\n\nThe question is, can Perry make make fans forget about Tyson's absence?\n\nPerry's 0-1 boxing record aside, Paul's challenger began training in the sport as an 11-year-old. In fact, he was actually from one of the sport's hotbeds, Flint, Michigan, where two-time gold medalist Claressa Shields and former super middleweight titlist Anthony Dirrell were both born.\n\nGrowing up in Michigan and Florida, Perry struggled with bullying and as a result, began getting into fights at school.\n\n'[In Michigan] I was one of maybe 10 white kids in the whole school, so I was bullied a lot,' he told MMA Junkie in 2015. 'It was the same thing at other schools. I wouldn't back down, so I would get into fights.'\n\nFighting didn't help Perry make honor roll, but it did provide him with a career path.\n\nStanding 5-foot-10, Perry began pursuing a career in mixed-martial arts and quickly established himself as a talented striker with nine knockouts to start his career.\n\nMike Perry points to a miniaturized Jake Paul head that he has attached to a chain on his neck\n\nPlatinum Mike Perry Shows off his skills during a recent open workout in Tampa\n\nMike Perry bleeds profusely during UFC Fight Night at the Amway Center in Orlando in 2018\n\nThe problem was, Perry wasn't entirely done with being a troublemaker.\n\n'I played Grand Theft Auto, and I wanted to be like that, I wanted it to be easy like that,' he told MMA Junkie in 2015. 'I smoked drugs, I carried guns, and I thought I was a gangster.'\n\nThere was an arrest for burglary, a two-year community control sentence, which is similar to house arrest, and a failed drug test resulting in a few months in jail for the aspiring MMA fighter.\n\nIn the end, it was the stint behind bars that Perry claimed set him straight.\n\n'The day I got out of jail, I showed up at the UFC gym in Winter Springs [Florida],' he told MMA Junkie, 'and it's been good ever since then.'\n\nHe'd go on to make his debut in the octagon at UFC 202 in 2016 filling in for another fighter, Sultan Aliev, who was forced to withdraw due to injury.\n\nFacing veteran South Korean welterweight Lim Hyun-Gyu, Perry earned a stunning first-round knockout victory, albeit one that was tarnished by allegations of racism against Perry's cornerman, Alex Nicholson.\n\n'He can't even open his mother***ing eyes,' Nicholson was heard saying during pre-fight introductions.\n\nMike Perry reacts after the conclusion of his welterweight fight against Vicente Luque in 2019\n\nJake Paul has dismissed Mike Perry as a mere 'appetizer' before his postponed Mike Tyson bout\n\nNicholson later apologized on Twitter, but Perry leaned into the comment days after his debut victory.\n\n'I don't think any of my competition can see me, and when I hit him, I opened a lot of people's eyes,' Perry told the MMA Hour's Ariel Helwani.\n\nPerry's victory over Hyun-Gyu and another knockout win over Danny Roberts helped to raise his profile, and he was soon facing tougher competition. He'd go on to earn consecutive 'Performance of the Night' honors in 2017 with knockout wins over Jake Ellenberger and Alex Reyes.\n\nBut as his competition improved, his record quickly fell from 11-1 in 2017 to just 14-8 by April of 2021.\n\nSo Perry left the Octagon and entered the fledgling Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship, where his striking power made him an immediate success.\n\n'He does have one-punch knockout power that I do have to respect,' Paul told reporters Thursday. 'But other than that, it's going to be easy.'\n\nPerry and Tyson have more than Jake Paul in common.\n\nLike Tyson, who has been convicted for everything rape to drugs, Perry has found himself on the wrong side of the law on several occasions.\n\nThere was an alleged 2016 incident in which Perry was accused of knocking a man unconscious after he approached the fighter's then-girlfriend.\n\nA similar situation unfolded in 2020, when Perry was accused of knocking out an elderly man. Perry was ultimately charged with a misdemeanor after telling police that he did not initiate any physical contact.\n\nBut Perry may have been at rock bottom in 2020, when his ex-wife and former tennis pro Danielle Nickerson told MMA Junkie that he had been violent with her.\n\nHe has denied the allegations and no charges were ever filed, although Perry did tell MMA Junkie that he has received help for both alcohol abuse and anger management issues.\n\n'I did not put hands on my ex at any point in our short term [sic] marriage,' Perry said.\n\n'I have realized that I have said some things in the past that do not put me and what I stand for in the best of light and for that I apologize,' he continued. I am now in a loving relationship where I am looking forward and excited to welcoming [sic] my first born. I'm hopeful my ex can move on and find peace as I have.'\n\nEven this week, Perry ignited some concerns by attacking a mascot at Wednesday's workout and ultimately needed to be restrained.\n\nMike Perry took on a mascot during his open workout on Wednesday in Tampa\n\nUltimately Perry needed to be pulled off the defeated mascot at Wednesday's workout\n\nBut if Perry has found peace outside the ring, he's also enjoying some newfound success between the ropes.\n\nIn April, he scored a first-round knockout over light heavyweight Thago Alves at BKFC Knucklemania IV to improve his bareknuckle record to 5-0.\n\nAnd this is where Perry finds himself now: An undefeated bareknuckle fighter trying to make an impact on the world of boxing.\n\nWith a win over Paul, Tyson's November 15 bout with the 'Problem Child' and its million-dollar purses would all be at risk. And while he claims he's unconcerned, Paul revealed he did get a phone call from Tyson to make sure he has Saturday's bout under control.\n\n'Tyson was concerned about me taking this fight,' Paul told reporters at Wednesday's workouts, as quoted by MMA Mania. 'He's like, ''What is Jake thinking? This guy Mike Perry is a killer.'' So he had some concerns. But Tyson, my message to you is don't worry. I'm going to put this guy to sleep. This is a Mike appetizer and you're next.'\n\nPerry, for his part, envisions things going in a much different - and far gorier - direction.\n\n'Your little baby green punches can't even reach my brain stem, bro,' Perry told Paul during a recent faceoff on DAZN. 'I'm going to dig through your eyeball and find your memories.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMAjunkie.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MMAjunkie.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare-knuckle_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bare-knuckle boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trash_talk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trash talk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTuber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTuber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Helwani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ariel Helwani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Promoter (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Channel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fan (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Nicholson_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Nicholson (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Lyndon B.

Some pundits and experts still doubt his boxing ability given that his lone fight against a trained boxer with previous in-ring experience was a losing effort in February 2023 against Tommy Fury.\n\nPerry spent five years in the UFC. He had a record of 7-8 before departing the promotion in 2021. Despite his below-.500 mark in the Octagon, he did earn notable wins against long-time veterans Paul Felder and Jake Ellenberger.\n\nPerry has found success in BKFC and currently maintains a five-fight winning streak against a mix of former UFC champions and ex-contenders, including Eddie Alvarez, former UFC middleweight champion Luke Rockhold, and current welterweight contender Michael Page.\n\nPerry's last bare-knuckle win came in April, knocking out ex-UFC welterweight title challenger Thiago Alves and needing less than a round to get the victory.\n\nAlthough Paul and Perry showed a level of respect for one another at Thursday's pre-fight press conference in Tampa, Fla., it remains all business come fight night.\n\n\"The skills is what pay the bills,\" Paul said. \"And he has no footwork, no head movement, no defense. He's a great offensive fighter and bare-knuckle, but in terms of boxing, he's going to get picked apart very quickly, and it's going to be a short night. Like I said, my predictions are never wrong, so I stand on business every single time I manifested into reality. I, Jake Joseph Paul, will knock out Mike Perry in less than two rounds. It's going to happen; put money on it.\"\n\nPerry has competed in combat sports for over a decade. He said Paul was mistaken for discrediting his boxing ability.\n\n\"Don't worry, you're going to get what you've been asking for -- the fight to go longer than one round,\" Perry said. \"[I'm going to] give you hell in the first round, and you'll get tired. You're going to be grasping for air. I made a new word, grasping.\"\n\nPaul and Perry are far from a circus.\n\nThe bout will take place as the main event of a nine-fight card contested across eight, three-minute rounds using traditional boxing rules.

But practically speaking, the squared circle is Paul's arena of choice. Barring fatigue, flat-footedness, or an apparent injury, Paul should be able to use his crisp strikes to land the KO shot and punch (literally and figuratively) a ticket to the anticipated date with Mike Tyson on November 15 in Arlington, Texas.", "source": {"uri": "deadspin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadspin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fury", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare-knuckle_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bare-knuckle boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Ellenberger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Ellenberger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Felder", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Felder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Alves_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Alves (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Alvarez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Alvarez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Rockhold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Rockhold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middleweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAZN", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DAZN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://lineup-publishing.s3.amazonaws.com/1721402972663", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-15", "textStart": 2997, "textEnd": 3008}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

The sky is the limit when you don't put any barriers or boundaries on what you can accomplish. I want to test myself and get under the bright lights.\"\n\n\"This whole entire thing is a giant risk,\" he added. \"I'm focused on July 20, I'm focused on Mike Perry, and just being in that mindset is what will lead me to victory.\"\n\nMORE: How much money has Jake Paul made in his career?\n\nPerry competed in the UFC for years before making his mark in bare-knuckle fighting. \"Platinum\" has gone 5-0 in Bare Knuckle FC with three straight knockout wins.

some light shadow boxing before hammering the pads.\n\nFor the most part, he looked pretty sharp although he did miss the mitts on occasion, leading fans to jump on his back.\n\nReacting to a clip from his open workout, one supporter tweeted: \"I know pad work don't mean s*** but I promise you this fight is gonna be a mismatch.\n\n\"Mike Perry can't f***ing box and he gets hit too much he's getting knocked out so brace yourselves, guys.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a fourth commented: \"Mike Perry looks worse than a white-collar fighter.\"\n\nPerry opens up as a 16/5 underdog with the bookies but on paper, he is one of Paul's toughest tests to date.\n\n'Platinum' boasts an unblemished 5-0 bare-knuckle boxing record with BKFC and is in his physical prime at 32, unlike the majority of Paul's previous foes.\n\nHowever, the 'King of Violence' is significantly undersized.\n\nPerry competed at welterweight (170lbs) in the UFC and fights at 185lbs in BKFC.\n\nHe has never fought as high as cruiserweight (200lbs), which is Paul's natural weight class.\n\nThe ex-Disney star was supposed to face Mike Tyson this weekend in a heavyweight clash but that fight was postponed after 'Iron Mike' suffered an ulcer flare-up.\n\nTyson was deemed medically unfit to compete this summer so their crossover contest was pushed back to November 15, with Perry stepping in to face Paul on the originally

Mike Perry: Date, Time And How To Watch", "body": "Jake Paul climbs back into the boxing ring on Saturday, July 20, in Tampa, FL, at the Amalie Arena. Paul will take on former UFC fighter and BKFC star Platinum Mike Perry.\n\nPerry replaced Mike Tyson, who was originally scheduled to face Paul at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, TX, in what would be Netflix's first-ever live sports event.\n\nTyson became ill, and the fight with Paul was postponed until November, but to keep the date intact, the pivot was to Perry as an opponent.\n\nBefore we talk a bit more about Paul's latest boxing challenge, here is a look at all the pertinent viewing information you'll need to catch the event.\n\nThe 32-year-old from Orlando is no stranger to combat sports. He has a 14-8 record in MMA. He has a perfect 5-0 record in bare-knuckle boxing with wins over Eddie Alvarez, Luke Rockhold, Thiago Alves, and Michael \"Venom\" Page. He's had one professional boxing match back in 2015.\n\nThat one didn't end well, as Perry was knocked out in the fourth round.\n\nAs a draw, Perry is as tough as they come. He seemingly lives to fight, and he brings an edge to him that could be great for the PPV sales of the fight.\n\nBeing relatively local to the Tampa area could also help to boost ticket sales.\n\nWhile Paul is headed for his scrap with Perry, he has never taken his eye off the fight with Tyson. Despite the age gap, Paul remains focused on getting that massive fight done and making history on Netflix.\n\nDespite Paul's relative inexperience, he may prove to have better technical skill with the sweet science than Perry possesses.\n\nThe fight should be entertaining, but Perry will need to wear Paul down or catch him with a big shot to create the level of havoc necessary to claim victory.\n\nThe Puerto Rican queen, Serrano, also makes her return to the boxing ring. Initially, she was set to rematch Katie Taylor in the co-main event of the Paul-Tyson clash.\n\nWith that massive event on pause, Serrano will stay active, but she will be facing a lesser-known opponent in Stevie Morgan.\n\nSerrano must escape without much issue or injury if she hopes to secure another opportunity to get the best of Taylor.\n\nThe latter won their first meeting by split decision in April 2022. The meeting with Taylor has been rescheduled as the co-main event for Paul-Tyson in November, but there is at least some pressure on Serrano to beat Morgan to keep the rematch with Taylor compelling.\n\nBe on the lookout for post-event details and a recap of the action from Tampa, FL, on Saturday night.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalie_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amalie Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AT&T Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Alves_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Alves (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare-knuckle_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bare-knuckle boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Alvarez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Alvarez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Rockhold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Rockhold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_decision", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Split decision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katie Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Writers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Writers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6673a6a921a19baa5ee6cd79/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 56, "textEnd": 63}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

While Perry has extensive MMA experience and is making his second professional boxing outing, Paul has a strong boxing record.Jake Paul and Mike Perry will face off in boxing on Saturday, July 20. The battle will start at 9 p.m. ET in Tampa Bay's Amalie Arena. Paul and Perry's main event is scheduled to start at midnight. Mike Tyson was originally supposed to face Paul, but he had to postpone because of a health problem, as per the reports of 'Newsweek'.\n\nThe most recent odds from different sportsbooks indicate that Jake Paul is the favorite in this contest. Paul's moneyline odds vary between -420 and -500 on various sites, indicating that he has about an 80% probability of winning the match. Conversely, Mike Perry's moneyline odds are between +300 and +370. This suggests that Perry is viewed as a significant underdog.\n\nJake Paul is 9-1 overall in his boxing career, with Tommy Fury being his lone defeat. Paul has never faced a ranked professional boxer, despite his stellar record. The majority of his boxing career has been against opponents with less ring time.\n\nMike Perry's background in the UFC and BKFC (Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship) is an important advantage. His record in mixed martial arts is 14-8 with 11 knockouts. Perry has, however, only ever boxed once, in 2015, and that fight ended in a loss. This fight against Paul will be just his second professional boxing match.\n\nJake Paul has a significant advantage to win the bout based on the current odds. Given his poor moneyline odds, betting on Paul to win straight up might not provide significant profits. With odds of -205 at DraftKings, the \"under 7.5\" rounds bet is a more appealing choice instead. The bet implies that the bout won't last all eight rounds.\n\nPutting your money on Paul to win via disqualification (DQ), technical knockout (TKO), or knockout (KO) is another possible betting tactic. These odds are available at DraftKings for -125, which makes them a competitive option when compared to the less favorable moneyline odds.\n\nWhen is the boxing match between Jake Paul and Mike Perry?\n\nOn Saturday, July 20, Jake Paul and Mike Perry will square off. The main event is scheduled to commence at midnight ET, with the event starting at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nHow does Jake Paul's boxing record compare to Mike Perry's?\n\nJake Paul is 9-1 overall in boxing, with Tommy Fury being his lone defeat. Mike Perry, on the other hand, is less experienced in the sport and has only had one defeat in boxing since 2015.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalie_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amalie Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fury", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-111845532,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-187867,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 295, "textEnd": 302, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

He'll try to add a bare-knuckle boxing star in Mike Perry to his resume on Saturday night in Tampa, Florida.\n\nOf course, Perry isn't the \"Mike\" that everyone was hoping to see Paul see in the ring. This was originally the date for a highly anticipated tussle with boxing legend Mike Tyson. However, the 58-year-old was forced to postpone the match on the advice of medical experts after an ulcer flare up.\n\nThat bout is now set up for November 15.\n\nStill, for those who enjoy tuning in to Paul's boxing career, this might be a stiffer test than he has seen recently. Perry had a middling record during his time in UFC, but he's found his niche as a bare-knuckle boxer with wins over UFC veterans Luke Rockhold, Eddie Alvarez and Thiago Alves.\n\nThis fight will take place under traditional boxing rules with gloves, but there's some intrigue as to how Paul will handle Perry's aggression. Here's a look at all the info you need to catch the bout.\n\nFight Info and Odds\n\nWhen: Saturday, July 20 at 9 p.m. ET (main event ringwalks approximately midnight ET)\n\nAt this point, Paul's earned at least enough respect to be the favorite against most non-boxers. Wins over Ben Askren and Tyron Woodley weren't as impressive because they were both more grapplers in their MMA glory days, but wins over Anderson Silva and Nate Diaz proved he could beat most people who are merely trying their hand at professional boxing.\n\nThat brings us to Perry.\n\nPerry was a stand-and-bang MMA fighter who has found that his approach to striking has generally worked in the bare-knuckle boxing arena. The problem is that there are major differences between the two sports.\n\nFor one, it's a lot easier to defend punches wearing full-size gloves. Thus, the sweet science is a bit more tactical and relies more on technique and nuance.\n\nThat's not a specialty for Perry. His aggression and willingness to stand and trade are his best assets. It's a different skillset than Paul has really seen in the ring, but it's also one that doesn't necessarily bode well for Perry.\n\nOne psychological component to consider is that Perry doesn't have much to lose here. This is a quick detour from his recent successful run in bare-knuckle boxing. A loss here isn't going to cost him much as he continues to be a star of the BKFC organization.\n\nPaul, however, has a lot on the line here. Perry is not considered an actual boxer and he has a huge payday coming up with Tyson in November.\n\nIf Paul can't take care of business in an emphatic way here, it's a loss for The Problem Child.\n\nPrediction\n\nNot only is Paul the better pure boxer, but he also has a massive size advantage. That has been true in more than one of his fights and he's shown the ability to take advantage of it.\n\nWhile Paul has a long ways to go if he truly wants to become a world champion-caliber boxer, he already possesses more skills than Perry. There is danger in this fight. Perry's aggression and power could cause problems if Paul isn't prepared with ways to mitigate it.\n\nBut the reality is that Paul is bigger, stronger and more skilled. That should show in the final result.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_ballentine@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Alex Ballentine", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare-knuckle_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bare-knuckle boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTuber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTuber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aggression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Alves_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Alves (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Askren", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Askren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Alvarez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Alvarez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Rockhold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Rockhold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyron_Woodley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyron Woodley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anderson Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Diaz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nate Diaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grappling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1721329494/hk4iw7tlintg9cwhpcmt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-15", "textStart": 586, "textEnd": 597}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 1135, "textEnd": 1142}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Initially Paul was supposed to fight Mike Tyson, but Tyson unfortunately had to postpone due to a medical emergency.\n\nThese two will face off in Tampa Bay at Amalie Arena, with the start time set for 9 p.m. ET and the main event will start around 12 a.m. ET. Unsurprisingly, Paul is the heavy favorite according to the sportsbooks.\n\nJake Paul vs. Mike Perry Odds\n\nAs you can see, the odds on Paul range from -420 to -500 to win straight up, which give him roughly a 80% chance to win. Paul has fought in 10 boxing matches and is 9-1 in those fights, with his one loss coming to Tommy Fury. Fury, ironically enough, is similar to Paul in that he is a former social media influencer who has turned his sights on becoming a professional boxer. While Paul's 9-1 record looks impressive, he has yet to face a ranked professional.\n\nMike Perry, meanwhile, is a former UFC and BKFC (Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship) fighter, with an MMA record of 14-8 with 11 knockouts. He has only boxed once in his career and that was back in 2015, and he lost his lone boxing match as well. So, while Perry has significant experience with the UFC and BKFC, this will only be his second professional boxing match, which goes into why Paul is so heavily favored.\n\nJake Paul vs. Mike Perry Prediction\n\nWhile it is not exactly a bold prediction to say that Paul wins, there also is not much value at any of the books. With that said, the under 7.5 is also a play at more reasonable odds of -205 at DraftKings. As this is an eight round boxing match, essentially the bet here is that this fight does not go the full distance.\n\nAccording to DraftKings, the most likely scenario is that Paul wins by a KO/TKO/DQ (-125 odds at DraftKings), which is another play that is worth locking in over the juiced moneyline odds.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_modi@newsweek.com", "name": "Matt Modi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalie_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amalie Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Promotions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Promotions", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2431573/jake-pauk-vs-mike-perry-odds.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 56, "textEnd": 63}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Mike Perry is a welterweight that I think was in the UFC at middleweight, and the fight is at 200 pounds. He has absolutely no chance. And by the way, Mike Perry, I'm sure, is a really tough guy, and at 160-170 pounds, he's probably a right handful. But you can't give 30 pounds away.\"\n\nContinuing, Hearn said:\n\n\"Jake's not great, but he's a big lump, and he's strong and he can punch a little bit, as well. I think he'll stop Mike Perry.\"\n\nPaul was originally scheduled to fight former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson this weekend, but Tyson had to postpone due to illness. The Tyson fight has been rescheduled for Friday, November 15th at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas and will be streamed live on Netflix.\n\nEddie Hearn spoke about the upcoming bout with Mike Tyson saying:\n\n\"The Jake Paul machine works when he's in a big fight. There's some interest in Mike Perry, and if the Mike Tyson fight does happen - which I don't think it will - I'm sure that will do big numbers.\"\n\nConcluding, Hearn talked about Paul's credibility as a boxer (h/t MMAJunkie):\n\n\"But he needs a dance partner. He's stuck between a boxer and an influencer. The influencer fights are going to make him more money. He wants the credibility for boxing, but he's not actually willing to take a proper fight in boxing. A part of him wants to establish himself and get the credibility as a boxer, but he can't fight anyone too good because he'll get beat.\"\n\nDo you agree with Eddie Hearns' take on the Paul vs. Perry fight?

Perry stepped in to replace him with his fight with Paul set for the cruiserweight limit of 200lb.\n\nBut Paul had boasted of piling on the weight while he was preparing to face Tyson and claimed to weigh as much as 230lb.

Jake \"El Gallo de Dorado\" Paul is back this Saturday when he takes on Mike Perry in Florida\n\nDAZN Watch it here\n\nBefore his fight with Tyson was cancelled, Paul said: \"It's just like shocking to people that that is how much I weigh. I think just because normally I'm fighting at 200 and walking around at 210. It's weird to me that I'm weighing 230. But since this was noodling after my last fight I'm just getting to eat as much as possible and it turns out my body carries this weight super well.\n\n\"And I'm only growing. I think I'll get up to 240 and probably cut down so I'm like way faster. But if I'm training for this camp - and camp hasn't started - but if I'm training in this camp at 240 and then I cut down to 220 it's basically like I had a 20lbs weight vest on for the whole entire camp. So my muscles are going to be so much stronger and that speed will come through.\"\n\nBut he had dropped down to 200lb for this weekend's fight as he and Perry came face to face for the final time before the first bell. The pair exchanged insults as they stood mere inches apart before Perry put his hands on Paul with the YouTuber reacting by pushing Perry across the stage and forcing the security guards to intervene.\n\n\"I'm trying to have some fun, that's why I let them go,\" said Perry. \"I gave him a little shove and they couldn't keep me back. Tomorrow night it's just me and Jake in the ring, it's going to be a glorious event. I didn't push him hard, I want to get him to the fight tomorrow. He gave me a little push; I'm a little lighter but tomorrow night I'm going to be as fast as lightening. I'm excited to get in the ring and put my gloves in his face. I love being a fighter, I was born for it and it's my destiny. I'm tough as hell. Jake can hit but I can take it and I'm excited to see what happens in the ring.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martin_domin@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Martin Domin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiserweight_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cruiserweight (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAZN", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DAZN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_cutting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weight cutting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorado,_Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dorado, Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dorado, Puerto Rico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTuber", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTuber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33286001.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-233718.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

However, Paul is more than ready to knock Perry out in a place where he's already delivered a devastating blow.\n\n\"It's a great fight. It's a bigger fight than I had even anticipated,\" Paul tells Complex. \"The reaction has been phenomenal going back to Tampa, Florida, where I won Knockout of the Year.

That's the case with Mike Perry and Jake Paul, who actually only sparred together for six rounds several years ago, but that session has become the stuff of legends, especially as they prepared to fight on Saturday.\n\nFor Paul, sparring a savage like Perry gave him the confidence that he was making the right choice to go from social media influencer to boxing enthusiast. Meanwhile, Perry was admittedly impressed by what he saw out of Paul that day, even if he doesn't spend much time dwelling on it all these years later.\n\nThat being said, Perry knew that sparring Paul in the past was going to come up constantly after he replaced Mike Tyson in the fight coming up on July 20.\n\n\"Let them do it,\" Perry told MMA Fighting about the narrative built around that sparring session. \"It's a good reason for both of us to fight each other. It was a seed I planted long ago when I told him I didn't want his little paycheck for showing up to spar, that happened after we sparred.\n\n\"When they told me going into the sixth, 'This would be the last round Mike,' I was like, 'OK, I thought he had an eight-round fight? Should we do eight rounds?' The gap was closing on him. The 'Platinum' pressure builds up over time.\"\n\nPerry recounted one particular moment during that session when he realized Paul was learning and adapting on the job, which was something he didn't expect when they first started throwing hands.\n\nAs a veteran with far more fight experience on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Perry also made some necessary changes to then turn the tables on Paul.\n\n\"I remember from when I sparred Jake, the first 20 seconds of the sparring way back in the day, I came out with this good combination I had back then where I [throw] the one-two and then I throw the three [hook] to the body and, boom, I caught him,\" Perry said. \"Left hook to the liver. Twenty seconds in he [grimaces] and goes, 'Good shot, it was a good body shot.' I kind of lightened up a little bit, and then boom, he kind of hit me with some of those sniper shots from the outside. I'm like, 'OK, time to pick it back up.'\n\n\"I give him credit because he adjusted and I wasn't able to get that body shot back in on him that day. I remember that. So I understand that he's going to adjust to some things.\"\n\nThat sparring session happened when Perry was still a UFC fighter, so he was nowhere near the boxer he is today after turning his full attention to bare-knuckle boxing over the past few years. He has since also scored a win over veteran boxer Michael Seals in 2021 in an adjusted rule set for Triad Combat.\n\nThere's little doubt that Paul has evolved as well, which is why Perry is expecting the unexpected when they meet again on Saturday.\n\n\"He might start slow,\" Perry said. \"He might get better as the fight goes on. He might try to carry his weight or put it on me. I expect him to have no choice but to run because I'm the smaller guy. I'll cut the short angles, I'll slip side to side and take the angle around him and give him the old reach-around like he said he would give to me.\"\n\nAhead of the fight, Paul has continuously touted himself as a future champion, but his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as a boxer still faces constant criticism. The only opponent on his record with equal size, age, and skill counts as Paul's only loss against Tommy Fury by split decision in 2023.\n\nPrior to the Perry matchup getting booked, Paul was supposed to face Tyson, who was a ferocious heavyweight champion in his day but also just celebrated his 58th birthday.\n\nPaul has largely decorated his record with fights against UFC veterans such as Nate Diaz, Anderson Silva, and Tyron Woodley, with his past two wins coming against journeymen boxers who both got obliterated inside the first round.\n\nDespite entering this fight as the underdog, Perry expects all of those factors from Paul's past to rob him of the praise he should receive with a win, but he knows just how much this fight means to him.\n\n\"When I beat him, they're going to take it away from me,\" Perry said. \"They're going to say, 'We knew it, Jake wasn't ready for an opponent like this,' but you've got to look at the stats. I'm 0-1 as a pro boxer. Yes, I have about 30 professional fights, so I had so much success in the MMA world and now bare-knuckle boxing. People aren't giving bare-knuckle boxing the credit it deserves.\n\n\"But Jake is 9-1 in pro boxing and he's fought about two or three real fighters. I think experience, everything here is lined up perfectly. I'm going to give Jake a nose job.\"", "source": {"uri": "mmafighting.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MMA Fighting"}, "authors": [{"uri": "damon_martin@mmafighting.com", "name": "Damon Martin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparring", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sparring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMA_Fighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MMA Fighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hook (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fury", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_decision", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Split decision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare-knuckle_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bare-knuckle boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyron_Woodley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyron Woodley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anderson Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Diaz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nate Diaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cPo2OoGoniXewJ2fxv2uwvsZtCw=/0x0:2000x1000/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24036955/BKFC_London_NV555.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 982, "textEnd": 989}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Check out available DraftKings promos for Paul vs Perry.\n\nOne of the most popular prop bets for any boxing match is whether the fight will go the full scheduled distance or end inside the limit. For this 8-round bout, oddsmakers strongly favor an early finish, with \"No\" juiced to -200.\n\nHowever, I actually lean toward this fight going the distance at +160. While Paul has shown KO power, it's come against fairly low-level opposition. Perry is as tough as they come, with an incredible chin and only 1 KO loss in MMA and bare-knuckle fighting.\n\nPerry will bring relentless pressure, which could give Paul some problems, but I expect the YouTuber to use his reach and mobility to stay on the outside and rack up points. He's gone 8 rounds before and shown the ability to adapt mid-fight.\n\nI don't see Perry having the boxing skills to seriously trouble Paul or score a stoppage himself. His best path to victory is swarming Paul and making it a dog fight, but Paul is smart enough to avoid those battles.\n\nWhile the oddsmakers favor Paul to win by stoppage, I actually see a lot of value on the YouTube star to win by decision at +210 (32.3% implied probability).\n\nPaul has shown improvements in his boxing, but I question if his power will hold up against an iron-chinned veteran like Perry. He's still early in his development, and Perry is a massive step up from the likes of AnEsonGib and Nate Robinson.\n\nI expect Paul to fight a smart, measured fight, using his jab and movement to frustrate Perry and pile up points. He's gone the distance in four of his 10 fights, so he knows how to maintain his composure and stick to a gameplan.\n\nPerry will be there all night brawling, but I don't see him winning minutes cleanly, and it's unlikely he catches Paul with a fight-ending shot. A wide decision win for the A-side is the most probable outcome to me.\n\nPick:\n\nSince I'm predicting a decision win for Paul, I don't have a strong lean on the round betting props. That said, if you do fancy a Paul stoppage, rounds 5-8 offer the best value.\n\nPerry has never been stopped due to strikes, so it's more likely Paul wears him down with an accumulation of punches rather than one big shot. The +850 on round 5 and the ascending odds from there look appealing.\n\nFor a longshot, Paul in round 7 at +1200 is intriguing. We've seen him fade late in fights before, and maybe Perry's pressure could force him to empty the gas tank for a late stoppage. But overall, this feels like a true pick'em in the round props.", "source": {"uri": "sportsbettingdime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Betting Dime"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brady_trettenero@sportsbettingdime.com", "name": "Brady Trettenero", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition_bet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Proposition bet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare-knuckle_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bare-knuckle boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalie_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amalie Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiserweight_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cruiserweight (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Odds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTuber", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTuber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nate Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jab", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Writers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Writers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.sportsbettingdime.com/app/uploads/media/4/USATSI_21153865-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 182, "textEnd": 191}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-07-", "textStart": 755, "textEnd": 762}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Perry's unpredictable personality and fighting style have contributed to his recent stardom and popularity. Facing Jake Paul in a big boxing match, Perry has the chance to gain more fans and elevate his name value.\n\nTo many fans who are tapped into the sport of MMA, Mike Perry is a relatively well-known figure. However, in the world of professional boxing, the world he is stepping into this weekend for the biggest fight of his life against Jake Paul, Perry is somewhat of an unknown entity to many people.\n\nAhead of the biggest fight of his life this weekend, GIVEMESPORT has put together an explainer on who Mike Perry actually is and will take you through a timeline of the former UFC welterweight's career and a little dive into why his character has won over so many combat sports fans over the years.\n\nMike Perry's UFC Career Perry joined the UFC in 2016 as a young, confident, and exciting undefeated welterweight\n\nIn 2016, Mike Perry joined the UFC in what was arguably the promotion's most successful signing of the year, as an undefeated and very highly rated welterweight prospect with a professional MMA record of 7-0, with all of his wins coming via KO. 'Platinum's' UFC career couldn't have really got off to a better start as he made his debut on the huge UFC 202 card which was headlined by one of the biggest fights in the company's history, the rematch between Conor McGregor and Nate Diaz.\n\nPerry took advantage of being on such a big card with so many eyes watching as he pretty brutally finished South Korean fighter, Hyun Gyu Lim, in the very first round. In his first five UFC bouts, Perry was successful in four of them, once again all coming via KO, including one of the most brutal KOs in UFC history over welterweight veteran, Jake Ellenberger.\n\nUnfortunately for Perry, these first five fights were the peak of his success in the UFC and following his loss to Santiago Ponzinibbio at the back end of 2017, 'Platinum' clearly, despite still being young, was on a bit of a decline and, the once tipped to be a future highly ranked welterweight contender, went to being looked at as just a fighter the UFC could put on a card to put on an entertaining fight.\n\nFollowing his loss to Ponzinibbio, Perry went 3-6 in his remaining UFC fights and ultimately departed the promotion in 2021 after being beaten down by Daniel Rodriguez. Despite never really threatening the UFC welterweight rankings, Perry became a name which when fans looked at a card and his name was on it, they knew they would be guaranteed a great fight. Perry's UFC career came to a close having shared the Octagon with the UFC Hall of Famer, Donald 'Cowboy' Cerrone, as well as two of the welterweight division's most tough and brutal fighters, Geoff Neal and Vicente Luque.\n\nMike Perry's Move to BKFC In early 2022, Perry debuted in Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship in what felt like a natural career move\n\nOn the 26th of October 2021, it was officially announced that Mike Perry had signed with BKFC following the expiry of his UFC contract. The move to BKFC always felt like a natural one for 'Platinum' to make given his brutal style of fighting and his toughness and, as expected, he had phenomenal success in his move over to bare-knuckle and was very quickly considered the best fighter in that realm of combat sports.\n\nPerry is currently undefeated in BKFC with a record of 5-0 with wins over two former UFC world champions in Eddie Alvarez and Luke Rockhold, one former UFC welterweight title contender in Thiago Alves, and current UFC star, Michael 'Venom' Page. The story of Perry's BKFC career so far has been him breaking his opponents. His toughness matched with his genuine striking ability made him an instant success in the sport of bare-knuckle fighting, and saw him labelled as 'The King of Violence.'\n\nDespite venturing over to boxing to face Jake Paul, Perry is still under contract with BKFC and, along with Conor McGregor, he is currently an owner of the company. Speaking of McGregor, speaking at a BKFC press conference just yesterday, 'The Notorious' seemed to hint that once his UFC contract is up he could make a venture over to bare-knuckle, and in previous months, Perry has spoken about the possibility of a McGregor match-up in BKFC and seemed to believe that the fight had a realistic chance of happening.\n\nIf Perry is successful over Paul this weekend at an event that will have millions of eyes watching, it may just give McGregor that little boost to come over and face Perry if his stock rises further this weekend.\n\nRelated Conor McGregor is Rooting For Mike Perry to Beat 'Dweeb' Jake Paul\n\nConor McGregor did not hold back when talking about Mike Perry against Jake Paul.\n\nMike Perry's Character and Popularity In the last few years, Perry's popularity has shot up\n\nA huge reason behind Mike Perry's retained relevancy and fan base since his departure from the UFC is his personality and character. 'Platinum' is viewed as somewhat of a live wire and is very unpredictable with whatever he says or is about to do. Despite many promotions being naturally put off by this type of behaviour, BKFC has really embraced this side of Perry and have leaned into him being an unpredictable maniac and that is what has really led to his recent stardom.\n\nPerry's character and popularity along with his legitimate ability to be able to co-promote a fight is the exact reason why he is getting the opportunity to fight as big of a name as Jake Paul. Whether he is successful in his second venture over to professional boxing or not, Perry will leave the bout with more fans and more name value than he walked into the fight with and that is both huge for Perry and his future in BKFC and combat sports.\n\nMike Perry Faces Jake Paul Perry steps into the professional boxing ring for the second time tomorrow against Jake Paul\n\nTomorrow night, the 20th of July, Mike Perry will compete in the biggest fight of his combat sports career to date against Jake Paul in the boxing ring.\n\nDespite owning a professional boxing record of 0-1, Perry has been given a huge opportunity and a big payday to face 'The Problem Child' and be Mike Tyson's replacement opponent. Tyson, of course, was originally scheduled to face Paul this weekend, but was forced to withdraw from the bout due to a recent medical emergency which led to the bout being postponed until later this year.\n\nPaul vs Perry will be available to watch live on DAZN and has a pretty good undercard featuring unified featherweight boxing world champion, Amanda Serrano, as well as what could be a pretty entertaining fight between Julio Cesar Chavez Jr and former ranked UFC middleweight, Uriah Hall.\n\nRelated What Mike Perry is Wearing Around his Neck Ahead of Jake Paul Fight\n\nThis is what Mike

If he loses the fight, there is a risk of the fight against Tyson potentially falling apart.\n\nTherefore, Moicano believes the judges will do everything in their power to hand Paul the win. Additionally, both Gilbert Burns and Moicano agreed that Perry does have a strong chance of winning in a fair fight.\n\nHowever, he is better off not leaving it in the hands of the judges. The Brazilian duo stated that they were rooting for Perry to get a win against 'The Problem Child'.\n\nYes, and no!\n\n'The Problem Child' was supposed to take on Mike Tyson next month. However, an ulcer flare up forced Tyson to miss a few weeks of training due to which the fight was postponed. However, the tickets for the event were already sold out, and the venue booked. Therefore, all the fans who bought the tickets were issued new tickets for the new date that has been set.\n\nSince there is a lot of money that has already been put into it, it is unlikely that the fight will get called off even if Paul loses the fight.\n\nHowever, the demand and the hype around the fight will die down massively if Paul is unable to overcome Mike Perry.\n\nNow speaking of Perry, he does have a very good chance of actually beating Paul if the fight doesn't go the distance. He is a smaller man, much faster and is hard as nails. Platinum Perry is called that for a reason because that chin is unbreakable.\n\nAnd he loves a bit of violence himself. No man without a taste of his own blood becomes the BKFC champion. So Paul will definitely have to watch out but as far as the Tyson fight is concerned, he is still doing that.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_binoy@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Kevin Binoy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_recording_certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Music recording certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare-knuckle_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bare-knuckle boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Problem_Child", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Problem Child"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/07/1e60ff27-untitled-design-2024-07-19t120239.961.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The pay-per-view event is an eight-round cruiserweight bout at 200 pounds.\n\nPaul, 27, is 9-1 with six knockouts as a professional boxer, although the quality of his opponents to date has been highly panned.

You saw what I did to Nate Diaz, who you went toe-to-toe with.\"\n\nPaul has won three consecutive fights since his lone loss by split decision to Tommy Fury in February 2023.

An ulcer flare-up delayed a fight against Mike Tyson contest. Now, Paul faces Mike Perry, the \"King of Violence.\"\n\nPaul (9-1) competes against his fifth different MMA fighter in six fights (he beat Tyron Woodley twice). He is 2-1 against boxers, winning two straight against legitimate boxers, considered on his level. The YouTuber was preparing to face a 58-year-old Tyson, but Paul is ready to fight someone that reminds him of \"Iron\" Mike.\n\n\"This guy is violent. Mike Perry is a killer. He's a mini Mike Tyson,\" Paul told Dan Rafael via Big Fight Weekend. \"The fans love this. The fans have been wanting this for a couple of years, so let's make this happen, and that's really where the motivation came from.\"\n\nPerry (1-0) turned pro in MMA in 2014. \"Platinum\" joined the UFC in 2016, going 7-8 with the promotion. He found a home with Bare Knuckle FC, going 5-0 in bare-knuckle fighting, winning three straight via TKO. The Paul fight will be his second pro boxing bout.\n\nWATCH: Jake Paul vs. Mike Perry, live on DAZN\n\nPaul will have a five-inch reach and a few-inch height advantage over Perry. Still, the former sparring partner of Paul believes he will have an edge on fight night.\n\nHere are some of the fun prop bets available on DraftKings that offer the best value.\n\nTo see even more props for Paul-Perry, head over to DraftKings.\n\nBoth fighters can be brawlers if they want to be. However, their in-ring mechanics reveal opposing methods of attack.\n\nPaul is a power puncher but can also fight in and out of the distance. He landed 49 of 157 shots (31.2%) against Tommy Fury, knocking down the Love Island star in a loss. Against Nate Diaz, Paul landed 174 of 491 shots (35.4%), landing 140 for power. Of those shots, 34 jabs kept Diaz at bay, and he went the distance against someone known for being a cardio king.\n\nAgainst Andre August, Paul used his jabs to push his opponent back, and when August tried to land something meaningful, Paul put him to sleep. Paul used jabs, uppercuts, and body shots to bully Ryan Bourland, who had one fight in four and a half years before facing Paul. He later trapped Bourland in the corner and landed a flurry of punches to the head.\n\nIn the octagon, Perry landed 4.32 significant strikes per minute. He also absorbed 5.16 significant strikes per minute, absorbing triple-digit shots in his last two fights.\n\nMORE: Who is the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world?\n\nWhat he has done in Bare Knuckle FC is pretty impressive.\n\nPerry got outlanded 127-110 against Eddie Alvarez, but he landed more shots in the clinch to the head and got the win via TKO. He landed 50% of his shots (30 of 60) against Luke Rockhold for another TKO win.\n\nWith a kill-or-be-killed mindset, Perry is a wild card. He may be the most dangerous Paul opponent to date. Will his bare-knuckle skills transfer well to boxing, where patience is key? Can Paul knock out Perry, someone who doesn't mind getting punished?\n\nIt may not be a technical fight. However, the clash of styles may result in the fight going the distance. If that is the case, Paul, who has taken his career seriously despite detractors, may be named the winner.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTuber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTuber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Rafael", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Rafael"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalie_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amalie Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyron_Woodley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyron Woodley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fury", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare-knuckle_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bare-knuckle boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sparring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Diaz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nate Diaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAZN", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DAZN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppercut", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uppercut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Alvarez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Alvarez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Rockhold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Rockhold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_for_pound", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound for pound"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-07/nba-canada--eafbe328-5cd8-4ce4-83d6-4c5353966a86.jpeg?itok=Q9JIKJnJ", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 77, "textEnd": 84}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

You can see a close-up of the jewelry right here. Perry fights the internet sensation Paul in Tampa, Florida on Saturday.\n\nMike Perry is set to wear a decapitated Jake Paul necklace ahead of their fight July 20 at the Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida.\n\nAfter a triumphant UFC career that saw Perry boast a 14-9 record, he transitioned into bare knuckle boxing and is currently on a five-fight winning streak. Within his time at BKFC, he has faced some huge names that includes Eddie Alvarez, Luke Rochold and Michael Page.\n\nHowever, the gloves will be put back on when 'Platinum' faces the 'Problem Child' in their upcoming boxing match. And, prior to their fight, Perry was seen wearing a custom chain with a beaten up, decapitated Jake Paul covered in diamonds, which he set to wear in his walk-out.\n\nWhat is Mike Perry Wearing Around His Neck? The bare knuckle fighting icon appears to have a decapitated Jake Paul as a necklace\n\nWhen speaking about the fight, Perry passionately talked about the efforts he went through to get to this fight.\n\n\"Look at that s**t, [Diamond Paul necklace] I worked so hard for this, this is not just another day in the office for me I thrive off of this I thrive off of pressure I live for this,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"I been getting paid millions of bucks fighting people, I been doing this a long time so this money fight aint nothing new to me, I'm hungrier than ever.\"\n\n'Platinum' then ended by intensely stating his goals, whilst enthusiastically shouting down the microphone highlighting his eagerness and devotion to succeed.\n\n\"I need 20 million, I ain't got enough yet, I gotta check that off my box list and get my mansion and get my yacht and get my family on the boat every day and you ain't taking that from me bro - I'm so hungry!\"\n\nJake Paul is Mike Perry's First Opponent in Boxing Since 2015 Perry's become a cult hero of sorts in bare knuckle\n\nPaul will be Perry's first traditional boxing opponent since he faced rising star, Kenneth McNeil in March 2015. The fight did not go as planned, with Perry getting knocked out in the fourth round after being met with a powerful overhand right from McNeil.\n\nCombining the learnings from this loss and his experience in BKFC, Perry will be hopeful of redemption in traditional boxing when he takes on the 27-year-old YouTuber turned boxer.\n\nIt seems the mind games have already begun for Perry, boasting his decapitated Paul necklace, which he hopes is a foreshadow of the night ahead.\n\nThe 'Problem Child' was originally meant to be fighting Mike Tyson, but after a late postponed due to health reasons, Perry stepped in for the opportunity to fight Paul.\n\nThough Paul may have one eye on the bigger fight at the end of the year against Tyson, will Perry's expertise in bare knuckle boxing be able to help him out, and will the necklace foreshadow the events on Saturday night?

That demand isn't the same as it was with a boxing megastar like Floyd Mayweather, Saul \"Canelo\" Alvarez, or even 58-year-old Mike Tyson -- who Paul plans on fighting in September, but rather a sense of \"What in the world is going to happen this time?\"\n\nWhen Paul's fight with Tyson was postponed from its original July 20 date as a result of Tyson having an ulcer flare-up, the social media influencer-turned-boxer went searching for an opponent to keep the date. That search led Paul to Mike Perry, the UFC washout who has become something of a sensation in Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship, and the pair now meet on Saturday at Amalie Arena in Tampa.\n\nPerry is, in theory, one of the most dangerous men Paul has stepped in the ring with. Given his reputation for aggression and powerful punching, a reputation that has only grown under the BKFC umbrella, many expect Perry to give Paul all he can handle and more.\n\nGiven the excitement and curiosity factor of a Jake Paul event, let's take a look at the card and identify our choices for some of the best bets to make at the sportsbook window.\n\nJake Paul via TKO/KO/DQ (-125) vs. Mike Perry\n\nYes, Perry is an aggressive fighter who could put some uncomfortable pressure on Paul. He's also going to be the much smaller man in weight, height and reach. Perry is a fairly average sized fighter at 170 pounds where he campaigned in the UFC and a bit undersized at 185, where he most recently fought at BKFC. In addition to being three inches taller and with a five-inch reach advantage, Paul had bulked up to over 200 pounds in preparation for his fight with Tyson. This fight is set to take place at the 200-pound cruiserweight limit.\n\nPerry also has thrived in BKFC because it suits his skills well. He hits hard enough but his punches without gloves have allowed him to cut, swell and knock the teeth out of opponents. But boxing is a different game, one where the gloves provided added defense and take away that kind of physically damaging shot that has allowed Perry to rebound from a 3-7 end to his UFC career. In addition, Perry's power is often overstated. Two of his three BKFC finishes were stoppages due to damage and he went the final 10 fights of his UFC career without a knockout. In fact, his final three finishes in the UFC were set up by knees and elbows, not punches. Given all this, Paul will likely be able to wear on Perry a bit with his size and use his superior boxing technique to land shots until he gets the stoppage before the conclusion of 10 rounds. That 10-round distance is also somewhat foreboding for someone who has never fought more than 15 minutes as a professional, exactly half the time scheduled for Paul vs. Perry.\n\nUriah Hall (+215) vs. Julio Cesar Chavez Jr.\n\nWe're taking a bit of a chance here with Hall, a former UFC fighter who turns 40 later this month and who holds a 1-0 record as a professional boxer after decisioning former NFL running back Le'Veon Bell in 2022. Hall is facing a former boxing world champion in Chavez. But Chavez is also one of the great wastes of talent in the modern boxing history. From drug test failures to weight misses to listless performances, Chavez disappointed boxing fans at seemingly every opportunity.\n\nChavez has come up short against a former MMA fighter before, losing to Anderson Silva in 2021 in lopsided fashion (ignore the one judge who senselessly scored the bout for Chavez). Chavez even managed to pull off that loss in his home country of Mexico, where his father is a boxing god. Chavez fought once more in 2021 and has not had a professional bout since. Now, he returns to fight at cruiserweight, a higher weight division than he's ever fought at before. Given Chavez's history of discipline problems and disappointing performances, why not take a shot on Hall as an underdog? If anything, it says a lot about Chavez that given the two fighters' respective resumes and skill levels that Chavez is a relatively small -280 favorite.\n\nAshton Sylve (-360) vs. Lucas Bahdi\n\nSylve is taking a nice step up as a 20-year-old prospect who is one of the centerpieces of Paul's MVP Promotions. Sylve seems to have the goods, with a good mix of power and technique that has let him dominate his 11 pro fights to date. Bahdi is a bit more experienced and also undefeated at 16-0. Despite that, we like Sylve to continue his impressive lightweight run and think the line is a bit closer than it should be.\n\nSylve likey works as a nice parlay booster. For example, pairing the Paul and Sylve moneylines is a solid play that comes in at -175. The Paul by stoppage line parlayed with Sylve is +130.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brent_brookhouse@cbssports.com", "name": "Brent Brookhouse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalie_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amalie Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canelo_\u00c1lvarez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canelo \u00c1lvarez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uriah_Hall", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uriah Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montel_Vontavious_Porter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montel Vontavious Porter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiserweight_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cruiserweight (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio_C\u00e9sar_Ch\u00e1vez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lightweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anderson Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le'Veon_Bell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Le'Veon Bell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/07/18/5fa9e4b3-e2c9-492b-a3ef-959b84f3b3de/thumbnail/1200x675/11b940c8597bfb5b1e480cb4d4caf87d/jake-paul-towel.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 482, "textEnd": 489}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Which Perry indicated his mother would prefer.\n\n\"Sorry, my apologies to her,'' Hewani said.\n\nMrs. Perry did not attend the press conference, according to Perry, who said his mother will attend the fight to be broadcast by DAZN.

It was after a third attempt in which he got rid of all the extra weight he had on the body to mark the exact 200 pounds that the protocol requested, that he managed to clear all specifications that were needed but we had a little extra preview of what we could see on Saturday night.\n\nA few hours after having checked all the boxes required for the matchup, Jake Paul and Mike Perry found themselves face to face on stage giving themselves an earful that ended in a very heated face-to-face interaction that got everyone hyped.\n\nIt was precisely Paul who couldn't wait any longer to meet Perry in the ring and responded to the provocations with a push that immediately made his opponent angry.\n\nThe tension was high and some pushing and shoving was presented between them as the preview of the boxing matchup was pretty much set.

Despite this gloved excursion, he remains under contract with BKFC, a promotion in which he is 5-0.\n\nFor more on the card, visit MMA Junkie's event hub for Paul vs. Perry.", "source": {"uri": "mmajunkie.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MMA Junkie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nolan_king@mmajunkie.usatoday.com", "name": "Nolan King", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalie_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amalie Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAZN", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DAZN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fury", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMAjunkie.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MMAjunkie.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_decision", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Split decision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2024/07/jake-paul-mike-perry-press-conference-faceoff-screenshot.png?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Well, guess what, Dana? You can rip up the (expletive) contract because I'm going to (expletive) up Mike Perry. Anyone you send at me, any one of your MMA fighters is getting (expletive) up.\n\n\"They've been trying to assassinate me. They don't want me in this sport. They hate that I run this sport, but when you try to assassinate a guy like me, it only makes me bigger. I'm on a mission from God, a mission from God, a servant of God to save this sport. And that's exactly what I will keep doing. Keep on winning, keep on fighting.''\n\nPaul has fought four MMA fighters -- Nate Diaz, Tyron Woodley, Anderson Silva and Ben Askren -- and defeated them all.\n\nPerry, who also competed in the UFC before joining the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship in 2021, shoved Paul back during the weigh-in. Several security guards then pulled Perry away from Paul.\n\n\"They working hard to protect him, bro,'' Perry said, referring to Paul. \"But tomorrow night in the ring, when it's just me and him, no protection. He going down.\n\n\"You've seen how hard those big guys had to work to get me back. I was pushing through the (men). Moving all of they (expletive). That's like a thousand pounds of pressure. That's called 'Platinum Pressure.' I'm putting it on him tomorrow night.''\n\nPerry's trainer James \"JT\" Taylor told USA TODAY Sports he didn't know anything about a potential contract offer coming from White should Perry win. Spokespeople for the UFC did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the matter left via voicemail and text.\n\nJake Paul weigh-in\n\n\"Platinum\" Mike Perry, also nicknamed the \"King of Violence,\" weighed in at 196.6 pounds. He got knocked out in 2015 in his only pro boxing match but is 5-0 in the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship.\n\nPaul, who as a pro boxer is 9-1 with six knockouts, weighed in at 200 pounds - the maximum allowed for the cruiserweight fight.\n\nWords were exchanged before the shoves.\n\n\"Why are you nervous?'' Paul said. \"I can see it in your eyes.\"\n\nReplied Perry, \"I'm excited.''\n\nPerry indicated he wasn't worried about the weigh-in showdown.\n\n\"You can have all this,'' Perry said. \"I want the ring tomorrow.

Meet the BKFC superstar who's trying to put an end to Jake Paul's boxing career", "body": "Mike Perry has emerged as one of the breakout stars in combat sport in recent years, carrying the majority of promotion for bare knuckle boxing.\n\nThe former UFC star was always a fan favourite in his octagon days, but was never able to get a great run going as he struggled to an 7-8 record. But since leaving in 2021 he has joined up with BKFC where he has become a massive draw.\n\nNow, he moves back into the professional boxing ranks to face Jake Paul as part of a massive grudge fight that headlines in his adopted home state of Florida. He is aiming to put an end to the Paul hype train once and for all.\n\nMike Perry is 32-years-old, and will turn 33 this September after facing Paul. It makes him one of the younger opponents the YouTuber has fought, with his last two fights against Andre August and Ryan Bourland both taking on veteran boxers already into their late thirties.\n\nAccording to Tapology, Mike Perry is 5'10\", with a reach of 71 inches. He weighed in for his fight with Paul at just over 196lb, although he has fought as low as 166lb in his boxing debut and 170lb during his UFC career.\n\nPerry is pretty active on social media, regularly posting on his X and Instagram pages where he has a substantial following. He has just under 850,000 followers on Instagram, while his X page has almost a quarter of a million.\n\nMike Perry is currently not married, but lives with his girlfriend Latory Gonzalez with whom he had a son in 2021. Previously, the fighter was married to professional tennis player Danielle Nickerson.\n\nThe pair wed in 2019 after five years of dating, but the marriage only lasted a few months and they were separated in 2020.\n\nThere is no true way for us to gauge any fighter's net worth, but a report from Sportskeeda claims Perry's to be around $1million. His last fight purse for facing Thiago Alves was revealed by the California State Athletic Commission to be around $600,000.\n\nIf sponsorships and PPV bonuses brought that number up, he could have earned almost seven figures for the bout, which headlined BKFC's fourth KnuckleMania event.\n\nJake Paul and Mike Perry are scheduled to make their ring walks at around 12:48am local time on Sunday morning, July 21. With the bout taking place in Tampa, that means Eastern time, so fans on the West Coast can watch at 9.48pm, while viewers in the middle of America get it at 10:48pm.\n\nIn the UK, it's going to be either a very late night or a particularly early morning as ring walks are expected around 5:48am. That means the first bell won't be expected until just before 6am, so set those alarms!\n\nIn December of last year, Perry defeated his second former UFC champion since joining BKFC as he outlasted former lightweight title holder Eddie Alvarez. The pair had an entertaining brawl for the two rounds it went.\n\nAlvarez, known for being one of the most violent fighters in MMA history, was unable to come off the stool following the second round meaning Perry won by TKO.\n\nThe first ex-UFC champion that landed on Perry's BKFC resume was former middleweight king Luke Rockhold. The massive size difference seemingly set Rockhold as a favourite, but he was unable to keep up with the sport's brutality.\n\nAfter having his teeth damaged early in the second round, Rockhold gestured that he was finished and the bout was waved off.\n\nImmediately following the Rockhold fight, Perry got to the microphone and called out Conor McGregor, who was in the crowd, for a face-off. The Irishman duly obliged and picked up a belt on his way into the ring, where he squared off with the 'King of Violence'.\n\nMcGregor has put his backing behind Perry for his fight with Jake Paul this weekend, insisting that he will beat the YouTuber.\n\nMike Perry is almost as well-known for his nickname 'Platinum' as he is for his ferocious fighting style and aggressive nature. Speaking on The MMA Hour in 2016, he explained the nickname in great detail, much to the amusement of viewers and host Ariel Helwani.\n\n\"A few reasons,\" he replied when asked why he was called 'Platinum'. \"I'm trying to be like 'Iron Mike' [Tyson] but with twice the skills. I conduct a lot of energy and I can absorb a lot of energy and they use platinum like they use gold in some electronic ways.\n\n\"If we wanted to set up a satellite to talk to God we'd probably make it out of platinum so it could reach across the universe and the energy would stretch far beyond anything we've ever known. It's a precious object that's wanted, hard to obtain. There's many reasons [for the nickname].\"\n\nMike Perry met his girlfriend Latory Gonzalez in 2020 after his previous marriage. By the middle of that year he had ditched his entire corner team in favour of just having her with him for his fight with Mickey Gall during covid.\n\nPerry beat Gall and was paid $180,000 ($90,000 to show, $90,000 for a win), which he claims helped him get out of debt. Since then, he has employed a legitimate corner but still involves her in his camps. The pair have a son together.\n\nMike Perry is known for his violent fight style, and none were more violent than his 2019 bout with Vicente Luque. He lost a narrow split decision that night, but received permanent damage that affected him considerably more as he suffered a gruesome broken nose.\n\nHis fighting style has meant that the injury has never been able to fully heal, and he will often poke at his nose during promotional appearances, noting its complete lack of cartilage.\n\nMike Perry is American, more particularly from Flint, Michigan and appears to be white. There is a meme in the MMA community that due to his having a two per cent African background in a '23 and me' test and saying a racial slur in previous videos that he is black, however that is just a joke.", "source": {"uri": "bloodyelbow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bloody Elbow"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship",

It's true, and it boggles the mind.\n\nFrom the outside, everything about this fight seems like a bad trip caused by some combination of energy drinks, ayahuasca and microplastics in the water supply. Both men are, objectively, pretty absurd. At least one of them seems to be doing it on purpose. Both of them are doing it to great acclaim and no small amount of riches.\n\nPaul has somehow gone from Disney kid to professionally obnoxious YouTuber to bafflingly decent boxer -- the kind of career you can really only have in This Modern World. Perry went from mid-level UFC welterweight to MMA cautionary tale to well-paid and weirdly, widely respected bare-knuckle boxer, the last of which is a phrase that only makes sense in either 2024 or 1890.\n\nThe original plan for Saturday's event was for Paul to fight Mike Tyson in AT&T Stadium live on Netflix. As counterintuitive as it sounds, please believe me when I tell you that was a less serious fight than this one. Tyson is almost 60 and, as we would come to learn, not exactly in fantastic health. It was intended to be a pure spectacle, and it probably would not have resulted in a very interesting or meaningful fight.\n\nThis bout against Perry, on the other hand? It might be in a much smaller venue and hidden away on a somewhat niche streaming service, but it is actually a real fight against a real opponent, and for a few different reasons.\n\nOne is that, unlike the other former UFC fighters that Paul has faced in the ring, Perry is a) still in his athletic prime, and b) a guy who always fought better on his feet than on the mat. He also comes into this with actual boxing experience, even if most of it is of a very specialized type.\n\nIt's fair to say that Perry's fighting career was resurrected by his time in BKFC (that's the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship, in case you're a total newb). There his mix of phone booth fisticuffs and complete disregard for his own face proved to be the perfect combination of skills. The man has legit boxing skills that are best put to use in a small space where he can do maximum damage. To fight Perry is to be confronted with someone who is constantly proving that life is not some precious thing to him. He wades into these battles as if his only goal is blood on the floor and he's not too particular about whose it is.\n\nPaul hasn't really fought anyone like that. There seems to be some part of him that secretly believes he could be someone like that. But you can't fake that thing, whatever that thing is that Perry has. And one of the appeals of fight sports is their ability to act as a truth serum that tells the world who you really are.\n\nPaul has fought some great names (Anderson Silva, for instance). He's even fought at least one decent boxer (Tommy Fury, who gave him the lone loss on his record). But he hasn't fought anyone with this exact combination of gleeful malice and actual surprising skill. It's a real fight, even if almost every shiny little thing about it seems, from a distance, completely ridiculous.\n\nAm I wrong for feeling genuinely excited about that? Maybe. Paul's greatest talent so far has been target selection, picking just the right people to beat while trolling his way from one payday to the next.

The WWE star and Dillon Danis previously clashed at their final press conference.

During the final face-off, the two boxers engaged in a heated verbal exchange that quickly escalated into a physical altercation, causing chaos on stage. These kinds of stunts are often used to generate hype and boost PPV numbers before the fight.\n\nMike Perry has taken over for the legendary Mike Tyson in the boxing match against Jake Paul. The YouTuber-turned-boxer will now face MMA and Bare Knuckle fighter Platinum Perry. Though fans may miss Iron Mike, this crossover boxing match promises excitement, as both fighters put on a show during the press conference.\n\nThe 58-year-old had to withdraw due to medical reasons, but the excitement for this fight remains high. The younger Paul sibling is known for taking on MMA stars, but this time, Platinum Perry is a serious threat with his striking skills.\n\nThe boxing match between Paul and Perry will be held at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida, and broadcast live on DAZN pay-per-view.

This will only be Perry's second traditional boxing match of his career; he lost his first match, which was way back in 2015, to Kenneth McNeil. Paul's record currently sits at 9-1.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about how to watch the Paul vs. Perry fight, including the full fight card, how you can stream the boxing match for free and more.\n\nJake Paul and Mike Perry face off this Saturday, July 20 in Tampa, Florida.\n\nThe boxing match between Perry and Paul will be available only through pay-per-view in the US on DAZN.

Perry fight, you can cut your costs with the help of a VPN. The fight's price varies by country, and by using a VPN with a location set to another location, such as England, you can purchase the fight for as little as \u00a319.99 -- which is the equivalent of $26 -- with no monthly subscription fees.\n\nA VPN (virtual private network) helps protect your data, can mask your IP address and is perhaps most popular for being especially useful in the age of streaming. Whether you're looking to watch Friends on Netflix (which left the U.S. version of the streamer back in 2019) or tune in to the fight for free this weekend without ordering on PPV, a VPN can help you out.

The 32-year-old Perry on the other hand has only competed in boxing once, losing to Kenneth McNeil in 2015.\n\nThe Internet sensation turned boxer notoriously tries to get in the head of his opponents during the lead-up to his fights, but this time, his pre-fight comments have irked his former rival, instead.\n\nFormer UFC middleweight champion and now UFC commentator, Michael Bisping, has made his thoughts on 'The Problem Child' known over the years, and there was a point when a fight between the two seemed likely due to their ongoing feud online.\n\nPrioritizing his health and considering he only has one working eye, Bisping opted against coming out of retirement to try and become the first MMA fighter to floor the outspoken Paul.\n\nDespite that, Paul's pre-fight comments this time round have pushed 'The Count' into wanting to come out of retirement to fight him.\n\n\"MMA fighters are all pu**ies,\" Paul claimed at the pre-fight press conference. \"Every single MMA fighter is a f****** pu** and they can't box for s***,\" the 27-year-old continued.\n\n\"Jesus Christ, you know what I mean, 'All MMA fighters are pu**ies and we can't box for s***', I mean that's really annoyed me,\" Bisping responded in a video on his YouTube.\n\n\"That almost makes me want to come out of retirement and smash this guy's f****** face in. I hope Mike Perry does it. There are so many great boxers from the world of Mixed Martial Arts that would whoop this guy's ass,\" the former UFC champ continued.\n\nThe UFC commentator went on to state that Paul cherry-picks his opponents, labeling him as 'fake Paul'.\n\nBisping, whose career was built on overcoming adversity on his way to undisputed UFC gold, is hoping that 'Platinum' Perry can overcome what will likely be some early pressure to go on to win the fight.\n\n\"I've never wanted someone to win a fight as much in my life, for the love of God, Jake Paul, please, I hope you get knocked out on Saturday night.\n\n\"Mike Perry is the smaller guy, but he's more ferocious, he's more aggressive and he's got a good chance of winning this... Jake Paul is fake, Jake Paul's an imposter, Jake Paul is a pretty boy who wants to seem like a badass,\" Bisping stated.\n\nThis Friday, the two took part in the official weigh-ins, and on his initial attempt, Paul missed weight by 0.4lbs. Less than 30 minutes later, the 27-year-old came in at 200lbs.\n\n'Platinum' Perry on the other hand weighed in at 196.6lbs, making the highly anticipated fight official.", "source": {"uri": "bloodyelbow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bloody Elbow"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bisping", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bisping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_Child_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Problem Child (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_recording_certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Music recording certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middleweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://bloodyelbow.com/wp-content/uploads/1/2024/07/GettyImages-2160664488-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

And things remained explosive on-stage at their ceremonial weigh-in.\n\nPaul and Perry have had a lengthy feud dating back to a sparring session between the pair in 2021 when the social media star was due to face Ben Askren. And they will finally settle it tomorrow night in Tampa, Florida.\n\nJake Paul and Mike Perry both took to the stage in front of a large Tampa crowd as they faced off for the final time ahead of their grudge fight. After both stepping on the scales to pose for photos, they were put together for one final face-off.\n\nThe duo, separated by Most Valuable Promotions co-founder Nakisa Bidarian, jawed at one another while squaring off, with Paul telling his rival: \"You're not ready for this moment, the adrenaline gonna hit you, for real.\"\n\nPerry replied by insisting that he was \"excited\" and insisted that he would be \"eating everything you've got\". When the pair got nose-to-nose and finally made contact, Perry shoved his rival slightly, leading to Paul pushing him right back and across the stage.\n\nSecurity managed to get between the pair as they successfully stemmed Perry, who was attempting to get across stage and make a beeline for Paul. And eventually they were able to be wrangled and brought for interviews.\n\nSpeaking after the incident, Paul said of what happened: \"He light, he flew like six feet. Dana White said he's going to give him a UFC contract if he can knock me out, well guess what Dana? You can rip up the f***ing contract because I'm going to f*** up Mike Perry.\"\n\nAfter their scuffle on stage, once everything was subdued, Perry managed to get on the microphone and leave a chilling message for his rival ahead of the fight tomorrow. \"They're working hard to protect him bro,\" Perry told host Ariel Helwani.\n\n\"But tomorrow night in the ring when it's just me and him, no protection. He's going down. You seen how hard those big guys had to work to get me back. I was pushing through the whole s*** moving all their a***es.\n\nThat's like 1,000lb of pressure, that's called Platinum pressure. I'm putting it all up tomorrow and I'm beating your a**, Jake. We here for a fight, like I told him we here for everything. I'm here to eat everything he's got, I'm taking your chin tomorrow, Jake!\"\n\nThe official weigh-ins for tomorrow night's fight actually took place earlier in the day, with Paul and Perry both successfully tipping the scales before the ceremonial event later in the evening. The bare-knuckle boxer made weight first, before his rival needed two attempts to make the cruiserweight limit.\n\nPerry came in at a career-highest weight of 196.6lb. The weigh-in was almost 30lb heavier than his boxing debut in 2015 against Kenneth McNeil, and more than 12lb over his last BKFC weigh-in when he faced Thiago Alves earlier this year.\n\nAfter that, Paul arrived flanked by a massive entourage, and made his way to the scales. There was a small degree of drama as he appeared to be .2lb over the limit, but he removed his shorts and weighed in again, eventually making 200lb on the button.", "source": {"uri": "bloodyelbow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bloody Elbow"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Askren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Askren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feud_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feud (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dana White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_recording_certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music recording certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Alves_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Alves (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Helwani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ariel Helwani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare-knuckle_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bare-knuckle boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiserweight_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cruiserweight (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://bloodyelbow.com/wp-content/uploads/1/2024/07/Jake-Paul-Mike-Perry-weighin-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

He's being taught the Kronk style of boxing. Kronk is all about high level boxing skills, Kronk is a science, it's an art, it's attacking, it's about knockouts.\n\n\"Jake is following in the footsteps of many great fighters who also learned the Kronk style. He's following in the footsteps of Tommy Hearns, Lennox Lewis and Tyson Fury. Kronk made them into champions, and like those men, I believe Jake Paul will win a world title one day as well.\n\n\"He's already training like a world champion; he's got a hard punch, good speed and good understanding of distance. It's not just his physicality, he's also a very smart fighter and he will show that he's a level above Mike Perry on Saturday night.\"\n\nComparisons to Fury and Lewis are incredible generous given the former is a two-time world champion who dethroned two of the most feared fighters of the current generation in Wladimir Klitschko and Deontay Wilder. The latter was a three-time champion who became undisputed after defeating Evander Holyfield in 1999.\n\nShishkin called Perry \"nothing but a warm-up fight for Mike Tyson\" and predicted that Paul would knock him out in the second round - and also claimed he would secure a stoppage over Tyson too.\n\n\"Once he knocks out Perry I really believe he will then knock out Mike Tyson because Tyson won't have timing or distance and also because of his age,\" he added.\n\n\"Jake already has the plan to beat Tyson and he's ready. We are no longer in Mike Tyson's generation, Jake Paul is the new generation of fighters who can box but also understand business.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oli_gamp@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Oli Gamp", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennox_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lennox Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyson_Fury", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyson Fury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparring", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sparring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fury", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTuber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTuber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare-knuckle_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bare-knuckle boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAZN", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DAZN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontay_Wilder", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deontay Wilder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hearns", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Hearns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evander_Holyfield", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evander Holyfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wladimir_Klitschko", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wladimir Klitschko"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33279314.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Jake-Paul-v-Tyron-Woodley.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-15", "textStart": 648, "textEnd": 659}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

In his way in BKFC star Perry, who has been on a roll since leaving MMA's top promotion in 2021.\n\nPaul has had a long-standing feud with Perry's former promoter, and was irked when rumours emerged this week that the pair may reunite if he beats the social media star this weekend. And he took his anger out on stage at last night's ceremonial weigh-ins.\n\nDuring the final face-off ahead of Jake Paul's showdown with Mike Perry last night, the pair almost came to blows after the YouTuber pushed his rival across the stage. Security managed to keep them apart, giving them enough time to talk to Ariel Helwani on stage.\n\n\"Look, Dana White said that he's going to give him a UFC contract if he could knock me out,\" Paul explained. \"Well, guess what, Dana? You can rip up the f***ing contract because I'm going to f*** up Mike Perry. Anyone you send at me, any one of your MMA fighters is getting f***ed up.\n\n\"They've been trying to assassinate me. They don't want me in this sport. They hate that I run this sport, but when you try to assassinate a guy like me, it only makes me bigger.\n\n\"I'm on a mission from God, a mission from God, a servant of God to save this sport. And that's exactly what I will keep doing. Keep on winning, keep on fighting.''\n\nAfter years of rivalry, White and Paul both took a bit of a break from talking about one another, with the pair going their separate ways. The boxer ended up going down the route of fighting legitimate boxers such as Andre August and Ryan Bourland as he moves towards a spot in the world rankings.\n\nBut when it was announced that Paul would fight Mike Tyson, White again took aim at him, mocking the bout before it was rescheduled for November. \"When the fight happens he'll be 58 years old,\" White said. \"It will be a 31 age difference. You know Jake Paul did fight a kid his own age and he lost.\n\n\"I saw this thing on the internet yesterday that if he beats Mike Tyson he'll fight Clint Eastwood next, Clint Eastwood is 93-years-old.

It's a typical \"Boxer vs. Brawler\" short-notice showdown ... and we're here for all of it.\n\nLet's breakdown the key factors in this intriguing matchup:\n\nOn paper, the physical characteristics of these two fighters offer an interesting contrast:\n\nPaul holds a clear advantage in height and reach, which could be pivotal factors in the fight. However, Perry -- despite being shorter -- is super aggressive, willing to eat punches just to get inside and dirty box. That forward-pressing style could negate some of Paul's reach advantage. The weight difference is also noteworthy, with Paul competing at cruiserweight (200 pounds) and Perry coming in at middleweight (185 pounds). This could potentially affect the dynamics of the fight, particularly in terms of power and endurance.\n\nThe contrasting styles of Paul and Perry are what makes this matchup so intriguing ...\n\nPaul has shown a surprising level of boxing skill for a relative newcomer to the sport. He is a very hard worker, a somewhat calculated boxer who relies on his jab, footwork and power. His boxing IQ has improved significantly since his early fights, demonstrating a willingness to engage in exchanges. However, he has also been criticized for facing relatively inexperienced opponents. And that really hasn't changed here -- Perry is not a boxer.\n\nPerry is a classic brawler with relentless aggression. He is known for his powerful punches, insane durability and fearless mentality. His mixed martial arts (MMA) background has given him a well-rounded skill set, including grappling and clinch fighting. However, he has also been criticized for his defensive shortcomings and tendency to engage in reckless exchanges. He lacks head movement, willing to use his own face as a punching bag just to land some shots of his own as previously mentioned.\n\nOn paper, Paul would seem to have the advantage in terms of size, reach and boxing skill. However, Perry's raw power, aggression and craziness makes him a dangerous opponent. Paul needs to utilize his jab to control the distance and avoid being drawn into a brawl, dictate the pace of the fight and potentially find opportunities for power shots.\n\nOn the other hand, Perry will more than likely attempt to close the distance and land heavy punches to overwhelm Paul and force a stoppage. The key for Perry will be to avoid getting caught by Paul's counter punches and to maintain a high pace throughout the fight.\n\nBoth fighters obviously have the potential to win, and the outcome will depend on which fighter is able to impose their will on the other. One thing is certain: fight fans are in for a thrilling contest when these two warriors step into the ring.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_myers@sbnation.com", "name": "Thomas Myers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalie_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amalie Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAZN", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DAZN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footwork_(martial_arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Footwork (martial arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jab", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiserweight_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cruiserweight (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middleweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinch_fighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clinch fighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punching_bag", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punching bag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grappling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gafz-VKJpH9Y6v0N1CpO_CW5PGo=/0x0:1380x690/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25538987/JAKEY_MIKEY.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-07-", "textStart": 305, "textEnd": 312}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Fortunately, Perry took to bare knuckle boxing like a fish to water, rising up the ranks and growing from underground fan favorite to genuine star. He's undefeated (6-0) since getting cut from the UFC roster, and it's highly apparent that Perry has come into his own and entered his prime.\n\nNow, Perry puts on boxing gloves again for the first time since 2015. He'll face a significant size disadvantage and give up his usual bare knuckle edge, but Perry can certainly be trusted to bring the fight.\n\nLet's take a closer look at Perry's boxing skill:\n\nPerry is a savage, but he's not without strategy or form. For some context, this section will review Perry's approach to boxing outside of the UFC, meaning only his BKFC and Triad Combat bouts will be considered.\n\nThose matches are our best insight into his performance against Paul.\n\nRegardless of height and reach disadvantage or advantage, Perry wants the pocket. Case in point: he closed distance on both Eddie Alvarez and Luke Rockhold despite the vast size differences involved. Once actually in close quarters, Perry tends to move his head reasonably well.\n\nPerry is known for walking through shots, and that reputation comes from his inability to close the distance with movement. As he marches forward, Perry does not move his head very well. He stands too tall, particularly by boxing standards, which means his upright head is an easy target for weaving hooks and intercepting straight punches.\n\nThat said, Perry does have effective distance offense in his own right. Perry can throw a stiff jab, and he'll make sure to jab with any opponent trying to keep him away. He'll also occasionally lead with the right straight then shift into Southpaw with a big swing, which is a very MMA tactic.\n\nOne of Perry's best distance tactics is attacking off the inside slip. Drawing a jab from his opponent either with pressure or his own jab, Perry will look to slip inside the punch and over his lead knee. The overhand right is a natural pairing with the inside slip and thrown simultaneously can really punish the jab. However, Perry also explodes off this loaded lead leg with both the left uppercut and left hook. Opposite the movement and range of men like Michael Page and Michael Seals, for example, the inside slip into left hook/uppercut produced some of Perry's best connections.\n\nA big shift in Perry's tactics since leaving the UFC has involved more body work. He was very much a head-hunter in the Octagon, but he's consistently worked to tear up his opponent's body. If able to gain the clinch, he'll commonly hammer away at the bread basket, but Perry will also use his body shots to close distance in the first place. As he steps forward, he'll dip his head off to the side with either the left or right hook downstairs.\n\nNotably, Perry really shredded Luke Rockhold's ribs. That's the most drastic height and reach disadvantage he's faced, and \"Platinum\" made up for it with leaping hooks upstairs and lunging shots. Any time Rockhold hit the ropes, however, Perry would squat down and try to break his ribs.\n\nRockhold didn't like it one bit.\n\nIn Perry's last appearance, he smoked Thiago Alves with a slick combination. Slipping inside, he first went to the body with a left. Then, he slipped again to reload his weight before going upstairs with another left hook, sparking the former title contender in just one minute.\n\nMike Perry's success in BKFC has never been complicated. His boxing overall is straightforward. What separates Perry from the pack is his ability to dig deep, endure punishment, and throw knockout punches with both hands. Perry is an absolute dog still at his peak, and we've never seen Paul in the ring with anyone quite like him.", "source": {"uri": "mmamania.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MMAmania.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_richardson@mmamania.com", "name": "Andrew Richardson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jab", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare-knuckle_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bare-knuckle boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalie_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amalie Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_glove", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing glove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Rockhold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luke Rockhold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hook (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Page_(equestrian)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Page (equestrian)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppercut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uppercut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southpaw_stance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southpaw stance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Alvarez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Alvarez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Alves_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Alves (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rib"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sts2a2eHK5QfmVeZdmuZDysHD6A=/0x0:3600x1800/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25529649/1774926843.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-07-", "textStart": 15, "textEnd": 22}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Paul began his career with Disney before transitioning to a social media influencer with his older brother Logan. The younger Paul brother attained notoriety after slowly pulling away from the influencer realm to a career inside the squared circle. Nonetheless, Forbes had him at number 3 among the highest-earning content creators.\n\nWith a professional boxing record of nine wins and a loss, Paul has shown skill, especially in the knockout department. After all, he secured KO/TKO victories over Ben Askren and Tyron Woodley. Moreover, he scored a knockdown against Anderson Silva. Currently on a two-fight finishing streak, Mike Perry is next for 'The Problem Child.' Preluding the fight this weekend, let's look at how much money Paul has made with his boxing career.\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, Paul's net worth is about $80 million, significantly lower than his older brother Logan's $150 million. Per The Sporting News, Paul took home $1.2 million for his fight against Nate Robinson and $2 million in his first fight against Tyron Woodley. Moreover, he made $1.5 million against MMA legend Anderson Silva.\n\nFor the battle against Tommy Fury, Paul took $3.2 million plus 65% PPV sales. In his last three fights against Nate Diaz, Andre August, and Ryan Bourland, Paul brought home an estimated $2 million, $7 million, and $6 million, respectively. In his upcoming fight against Perry, the 27-year-old will likely pocket eight figures.\n\nPaul's last two fights ended in the first round. Andre August and Ryan Bourland couldn't handle the power of 'The Problem Child.' The 27-year-old was initially scheduled to fight Mike Tyson, but the 'Iron' pulled out due to health issues. Hence, Paul accepted a fight with Mike Perry on short notice in this scenario.\n\nPreluding the fight, the younger Paul brother spoke with Pat McAfee on YouTube. In the interview, the crossover boxing star revealed his hope that the fight would go longer than his previous fights. He gave props to Perry but stated the matchup would be a boxing clinic, with his hands raised at the end. Will 'The Problem Child' record his third consecutive win? All fans can do is patiently wait for July 20", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "safeer_marottickal_sakeer@totalprosports.com", "name": "Safeer Marottickal Sakeer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyron_Woodley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyron Woodley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anderson Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fury", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Problem_Child", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Problem Child"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Askren", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Askren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nate Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_McAfee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat McAfee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Diaz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nate Diaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Jake-Paul.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 2264, "textEnd": 2271}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

That's why Wednesday's interaction involving Mike Perry stood out in such a unique way.\n\nPerry (0-1 in boxing, 14-8 in MMA), a former UFC journeyman who has used the bareknuckle platform of BKFC (of all places) to become an unlikely pay-per-view star, was finishing up his media day ahead of Saturday's high-profile boxing match against Jake Paul (9-1, 6 KOs) in Tampa, Florida (DAZN PPV).\n\nWhen asked about the recent controversy surrounding boxing superstar Ryan Garcia, which includes -- among a handful of outrageous moments -- Garcia's liberal use of racial epitaphs and religious slander, particularly against blacks and Muslims, the response from Perry was as surprising as it was refreshing.\n\n\"It's a free country, man. Freedom of speech is the first amendment,\" Perry said. \"But when you are talking business and being a role model with kids looking up to you, people need to be careful what they say because it can get you into a situation with someone who doesn't care about rules and laws and will maybe even hurt you. You have to think about the bigger picture before you do those things.\n\n\"My kids, I don't want them to have beef growing up because of their father so I definitely changed my ways. If it's something that upsets an entire group of people that it just wouldn't upset you to not do, what's the big deal in just doing the right thing and what's positive rather than getting on a whole group's nerves?\"\n\nWait a second? Are we still talking about the same Mike Perry?\n\nWhat happened to the \"Platinum\" version of Perry that combat sports used to know? Is this the same caucasian brawler who once justified his alarming use of the N-word by announcing that he had a \"free pass\" because of an unconfirmed DNA test he claimed could prove he was 2% African-American? And, is this the same man whose unchecked anger issues led him to everything from domestic violence allegations to multiple arrests for knocking out civilians in public, including an elderly man inside a Texas restaurant in 2020?\n\nIn short, that Mike Perry grew up. He got married to his longtime girlfriend (and part-time UFC cornerwoman) Latory Gonzalez, and soon after, became a father of two young children: a three-year old son, Ocean, and the family's latest edition, an infant daughter named Audyssey.\n\nAnd after his tumultuous 15-bout UFC journey ended in 2021 with more losses than wins, it was Perry's transition from MMA to the bareknuckle boxing space that produced one of the most unlikely star turns that combat sports has seen since the days of backyard brawler Kimbo Slice going \"legitimate\" through exciting runs in Elite XC, UFC and Bellator MMA.\n\nAt 32, the new Mike Perry finds himself at the peak of his athletic prime with a new house and a substantial amount of money in the bank following five straight wins with BKFC, including victories over Michael \"Venom\" Page, Luke Rockhold and Eddie Alvarez that made him everything from a legit PPV star to the face of a new promotion and sport.\n\nShould he carry on his upset ways this weekend in his eight-round boxing match -- while continuing to defy expectations as, once again, the smaller man against the 27-year-old Paul, who has spent much of his boxing turn feasting on past-their-prime MMA fighters -- the combat sports world will literally be Perry's oyster, with callouts of the biggest names in fighting (from Conor McGregor to Nate Diaz) a likely outcome.\n\n\"When I beat [Paul], we can ask him for a rematch if he wants it,\" Perry told CBS Sports in June. \"I don't know if he will. I don't know where he goes after this [and] I could care less. I might just go on a little vacation after this, that's what I might do. I have been fighting and winning and I might go spend some of this money with my family.\"\n\nIf you're wondering how Perry went from pariah to fan-favorite, all in the span of three years since exiting UFC, you wouldn't be alone.\n\nFor much of Perry's life, chaos and poverty was all he has ever known.\n\nA native of Flint, Michigan, Perry's youth saw him bounce around between 20-to-30 homes between the states of Michigan and Florida, with a very unstable family life to lean back upon. By his late teens, Perry was on his own and began to rob houses with friends in order to pay rent.\n\nAt 19, Perry's history of crime, which included a 2011 arrest for armed burglary, caught up with him when he was incarcerated for six months. But even though Perry enjoyed equal highs and lows once he exited prison and worked his way up to the highest levels of MMA, it was a post-UFC epiphany that likely played a big part in the more mature version in which Perry has evolved into over recent years.\n\nThe epiphany in question surrounds Perry coming to terms with who he actually is -- an aggressive brawler who can take big shots while outlasting his opponents -- and relying on those skills to see how far he could take himself in BKFC.\n\n\"I've been this happy since I had that epiphany and I told myself to be happy with who I am and what it is that I do great,\" Perry said. \"I have been so happy ever since I just chose to love myself and love everything that I'm good at. Gosh, I love my family. They are so beautiful to me and we are building something great here. I'm a provider and I have to take care of them. It makes fighting people for a paycheck a lot easier because it means I'm going to be taking care of my family.\n\n\"I have been getting my training and just enjoying my life and making workouts out of it. I had the family on the pontoon yesterday while I was on the kayak. My babies were all cheering me on while I was paddling down the ocean.\"\n\nPerry's transformation hasn't completely muted his often non-politically correct ways. But it has made him a fan favorite to the same combat sports fan who once looked at him as a ticking time bomb whose return to incarceration felt more like an inevitability.\n\nBut the key aspect of Perry's success these days is that while he has cleaned things up in his personal life and began to enjoy the spoils of domestic bliss, it hasn't stopped him from being the same explosive menace within the fighting circle. In fact, Perry is well aware of how many fighters, once they have tasted financial success, tend to lose their edge as competitors and it's because of that why he still embraces the natural anger that still flows inside of him.\n\nPart of that, of course, is strategic. The other part is that Perry simply doesn't know any other way.\n\n\"I just get angrier and angrier if you hit me because anger is where I'm truly happy,\" Perry said. \"I get happy and joy being pissed off. I'm pissed all the time for no reason. It's a constant battle [with] men's mental health awareness. I like to take breaks and like to try and go back and be a human being, a father and a husband. I try to make jokes and laugh at myself sometimes.\n\n\"But everything has changed because I do have everything. I am very comfortable [in life] but I still like to get down and dirty to the nitty gritty. I like to get back down to my roots and I never forgot where I came from.\"\n\nIt isn't lost on Perry that part of him being the fan favorite this weekend is because of how much Paul is looked at as a disruptor in combat sports after his transition from being a YouTube sensation and teenage Disney actor to becoming a (somewhat) legitimate boxer. But it's clear that fans are also cheering for Perry, the father and husband, to continue to defy the odds by cashing huge checks and searching out the kind of dream matchups once thought to be impossible for a fighter with a losing UFC record.\n\n\"I worked so hard for this. This is not just another day in the office for me,\" Perry said. \"I thrive off of the pressure. I live for this. I have been getting paid millions of bucks fighting people. I have been doing this a long time so this money fight ain't nothing new to me. I need $20 million. I ain't got enough yet. I've got to check that off my box list and get my mansion and my yacht and bring my family on the boat everyday.\n\n\"And you ain't taking that from me, bro! I'm so hungry! It's the 'Platinum' panty night. I am the money fight. I have been saying this. And my wife has a drawer of them 'Platinum' panties, if you will. We wear them every weekend.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_campbell@cbssports.com", "name": "Brian Campbell", "type":

Despite only starting out in the sport six years ago with an amateur fight with the brother of KSI, Deji Olatunji, Paul has gone on to beat several well-established combat sports veterans since.\n\nBen Askren, Nate Diaz, Anderson Silva and Tyron Woodley have all fallen to the powers of Paul since his pro debut against AnEsonGib in 2020, and 'The Problem Child' shows no signs of slowing down any time soon. He faces 14-8 MMA star Perry come Saturday, before preparing to take on boxing legend Mike Tyson in November.\n\nPaul was geared up to take on 57-year-old Tyson come July 20 at the ATandT Arena in Arlington, Texas, but medical concerns forced 'Iron' Mike to pull out earlier this year. Eager to still fight, Paul instead took a short-notice replacement in Perry and will go toe to toe with the bare-knuckle boxer this evening. But who is Jake Paul, and what does his personal life look like? Here, The Mirror breaks it down.\n\nHumble beginnings\n\nJake initially shot to fame back in 2013 when the short video platform Vine was all the rage. Born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, Paul moved to California to pursue his dreams of becoming a star, and by the time Vine was discontinued, he had amassed 5.3million followers and more than 2billion video views.\n\nPaul would centre his content around spoofs and skits on Vine, and would carry on with YouTube in 2014 - filling his channel with pranks, controversies and even music. His 'It's Everyday Bro' music video has racked up an astonishing 300million views on the platform, while his 'I Love You Bro' song featuring brother Logan has also achieved more than 179million views since debuting in June 2017.\n\nAfter gaining an incredible social media following and developing his online presence, Paul would find his way to the set of the Disney Channel series Bizaardvark, playing a character who would accept and perform dare requests. Paul would eventually try his hand at boxing in 2018, at the peak of the YouTube boxing saga including top stars like KSI, Joe Weller, AnEsonGib and Jay Swingler.\n\nHis first - and only - amateur bout would come against the brother of KSI, Deji, at the Manchester Arena in 2018 - where he would go on to win by TKO in round 5. Logan Paul and KSI meanwhile headlined the card, which ended in a majority draw after six rounds.\n\nBoxing career\n\nAfter dipping his toe in the water of combat sports in 2018, Paul started to take a career path in boxing seriously - training endlessly before booking his first pro bout with fellow YouTuber AnEsonGib in January 2020. Despite being scheduled for six, Paul would finish the fight in the very first round with a brutal straight right.\n\nPaul would run with his taste for glory in the squared circle following his victory in his pro debut, booking a fight with former basketball star Nate Robinson for November 2020. The YouTube star would win the fight by KO, stopping Robinson with a vicious right hook as he rushed towards him.\n\nWith a 2-0 record at risk, Paul would up the stakes by taking on former UFC star Ben Askren in his next bout in April 2021. Renowned for his wrestling capabilities and lack of striking technique, Askren went into the scrap as an underdog and would be finished by Paul in the first round via TKO.\n\nSince then, Paul has gone on to achieve victory over UFC stars Nate Diaz, Tyron Woodley (twice) and Anderson Silva, also beating Andre August and Ryan Bourland. While a split decision defeat to Tommy Fury in February last year may have outlined weaknesses in Paul's game, he remains dedicated to the sport and hopes to prove himself with a win over Perry on Saturday before a war with Tyson in November.\n\nBrother to Logan and a boxing family\n\nJake is the brother of YouTube star, WWE wrestler and businessman Logan Paul, who has also achieved high levels of success in the world of combat sports.\n\nPaul would kick off his amateur career in a fight against foe-turned-friend KSI in 2018, before losing via split decision in a 2019 rematch.\n\nHe would go on to fight one of the best boxers in recent history, Floyd Mayweather Jr in a 2021 exhibition bout, going the distance with the 50 former IBO, IBF, WBC and WBA champion. Jake would also find himself in the limelight in the build-up to the fight by stealing Mayweather's cap before being chased and restrained by his entourage. Paul would get 'gotcha hat' tattooed on his leg shortly afterwards to commemorate the incident.\n\nLogan's most recent fight came in the form of a sixth-round DQ win over jiu-jitsu and trash talk expert Dillon Danis in October last year - outclassing the Bellator star who tried to get Logan in a guillotine before swinging for him after the final bell had sounded.\n\nJake Paul's love life\n\nJake is currently dating Dutch world champion speed skater Jutta Leerdam, making his relationship official back in April 2023 with a sweet Instagram post alongside the 25-year-old, writing: \"I'm Dutch now.\"\n\nThe first photo from the announcement carousel showed snaps of Paul hand in hand with Leerdam, sporting camo pants and a black branded tee while his beau was dolled up in a revealing brown dress.\n\nThe second snap, meanwhile shared the couple running at night, Leerdam sporting a huge grin alongside her shirtless boyfriend showing his well-groomed physique. Leerdam has racked up several titles since making her debut on the ice at the age of 11, taking home several gold medals at the Dutch, World and European Championships.\n\nThe speed skater also claimed silver in the 1000-metre event at the Beijing Olympics back in 2022 and has multiple records to her name including the team sprint world record from 13 February 2020 with a time of just 1:24.029 at the Utah Olympic Oval. Paul has previously dated social media star Tana Mongeau and model Julia Rose in the past.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Just hours after the former UFC champion went viral for hurling insults at Jake, the younger Paul brother responded with an NSFW rant of his own, taking time out of his face-off with Mike Perry to turn his attention to the cocky Irishman.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, it all started when McGregor called Paul a \"little dweeb\" during his own press conference for the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship.\n\nPaul clearly hear the emasculating insult and crossed the line of political correctness with his response, unafraid to initiate all-out war with the famous MMA fighter. \"2021 Jake Paul is back,\" said popular combat sports social media account Happy Punch.\n\n\"You guys are all p*ssies. Every single MMA fighter is a f***ing p*ssy,\" he said to Perry, who had an unsuccessful UFC career. \"You can't box for sh*t, and when I try to fight you in MMA, you don't do it!\"\n\n\"You and McGregor, both b*tches. Will never fight me. F***ing p*ssies.\"\n\nIronically, Mike Perry caught strays from the insults of both men. Jake lumped him in with Conor as a weak MMA fighter. McGregor's full quote used his insult of Paul to tear down Perry in the process.\n\n\"Look at what has happened to Michael Perry, one of our big stars here. The King of Violence he titles himself ... now he's up against a little dweeb of a thing in a fight this weekend,\" he said.\n\nWhether it's the unresolved bout with Mike Tyson or his new ire toward Conor McGregor, it seems like Jake Paul is already overlooking Mike Perry ahead of their prime time fight on Saturday night. Considering the state of the Paul-McGregor beef and the way they both like to talk, there will probably be a lot more words exchanged before any punches are thrown.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hurling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_correctness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political correctness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime time"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Writers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Writers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/dbe48e3e13958f870ea2153ab7a1e3f8/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/07/18/17213337197351.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Paul's initial victories over internet personalities led to more challenging fights with former UFC champions, UFC Hall of Famers, and boxing veterans. Despite a recent loss to Tommy Fury, Paul quickly rebounded with wins against Nate Diaz and Andre August.\n\nDespite being still widely considered an internet personality, Youtuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul has been competing professionally since 2020. Many may not have expected Paul to have the boxing career he would when he initially began fighting. However, the influencer has managed to become one of the biggest names in boxing in recent years. This is attributed to his antics outside the ring, as well as enticing many of the big names in the world of MMA to step into the sport of boxing. Jake Paul continues to extend his boxing career year after year, aiming to progress through the sport. Thus far, his boxing career has taken him through the following journey:\n\nAli Eson Gib (1-0) Jake Paul wins via 1st round TKO\n\nJake Paul made his professional boxing debut in 2020 versus fellow internet personality Ali Eson Gib. Despite neither fighter having a traditional amateur boxing career, the pro-sanctioned bout took place in Miami in early 2020. The fight between the creators was not a long one. After dropping Ali Eson Gib twice, Paul was crowned the winner via TKO with just under a minute left of the first round.\n\nNate Robinson (2-0) Jake Paul wins via 2nd round KO\n\nJake Paul would turn his attention to retired NBA star Nate Robinson. The former New York Knicks point guard would step into the boxing ring for the first time versus Paul, without much success. A first-round knockdown for Paul was followed by a second-round knockout, meaning defeat for Robinson. The win would be the second of Paul's career as well as the second in 2020.\n\nBen Askren (3-0) Jake Paul wins via 1st round TKO\n\nIn his third professional bout, Jake Paul would take on his first combat sports athlete. Former MMA champion Ben Askren would step in to fight Paul in 2021, after retiring from MMA in 2019. Meeting in Atlanta at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Paul would extend his winning streak to three. A right-hand from Paul in the first-round would put down Askren, with the referee deciding that the former UFC fighter was no longer fit to continue.\n\nTyron Woodley (4-0) Jake Paul wins via split-decision\n\nJake Paul would turn to another former UFC welterweight in his fourth bout as he faced Tyron Woodley. The former 170-pound MMA champion made his boxing debut versus Paul in Cleveland, proving to be Paul's toughest test. Boxing fans would see the YouTube personality face adversity for the first time in his career after a significant right hand from Woodley. However, Paul ultimately earned his win via split-decision.\n\nTyron Woodley II (5-0) Jake Paul wins via 6th round KO\n\nJust over three months after their first meeting, Paul and Woodley would step into the ring with one another once again. This time, the pair took centre stage in Tampa in December of 2021. The fight between Paul and Woodley came to a more abrupt ending than their first bout. Despite some back and forth in the earlier rounds, Paul would land a significant right hand, sending the former UFC champion to the canvas.\n\nAnderson Silva (6-0) Jake Paul wins via unanimous decision\n\nAnother former UFC champion would be next on the radar of Jake Paul. UFC Hall of Famer and MMA icon Anderson Silva would come into the boxing bout with a professional record of 3-1 in the sport. In the year prior, in 2021, Silva had two successful bouts in boxing. A split-decision win over Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. and a first-round KO over Tito Ortiz meant Silva was in good form. However, the fight between the two did pose a significant age discrepancy. Silva would be 22 years the senior of Jake Paul, aged 47 on fight-night. Despite having success in the 8-round bout, Silva would be on the losing side of the judges' scorecards. Paul also managed a knockdown over Silva in the final round.\n\nTommy Fury (6-1) Jake Paul loses via split-decision\n\nFor the first time in his career, Jake Paul faced someone with a traditional boxing background when he entered the ring with Tommy Fury. The brother of heavyweight great Tyson Fury boasted a perfect 8-0 record when he faced Paul in Saudi Arabia in early 2023. The two had a back-and-forth affair throughout the 10 rounds, including point deductions for both men. Despite Paul knocking down Fury in the final round, it was the British boxer who got his hand raised via split-decision. This would be the first defeat of Paul's career and the 9th win of Fury's.\n\nNate Diaz Jake Paul wins via unanimous decision\n\nJake Paul would return his focus to MMA fighters following the loss to Tommy Fury. Following his departure from the UFC, Nate Diaz would be the newest former UFC fighter to box with Jake Paul. Despite a spirited and well-humoured performance from Diaz, Paul would return to winning ways via one-sided judges' scorecards. Diaz would also suffer a knockdown in his boxing debut, hitting the canvas in round 5.\n\nAndre August Jake Paul wins via 1st round KO\n\nAfter getting back into the win column versus Nate Diaz, Paul originally teased a transition to MMA. However, he would ultimately choose to take a step back from competing with MMA fighters and influencers as he took on Andre August. Despite not having a significant profile, American August would come into the bout with a 10-1-1 record. Seemingly taking a more traditional route into boxing, it took Paul just one round to dispatch August. The knockout victory for Paul was his first win via finish in almost two years.\n\nRyan Bourland Jake Paul wins via 1st round KO\n\nIn March of 2024, Paul's boxing career would take him to Cuba as he took on Ryan Bourland. Again, Bourland did not boast a big name. However, he did have the most professional boxing experience of any fighter Paul has faced in the past. Coming into the fight with a 17-2 record, Bourland was not able to showcase very much of his experience within the bout. It would be back-to-back first-round finishes for Paul, as a flurry of punches would end the night for Bourland.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"},

Serrano was originally scheduled to rematch Katie Taylor for the latter fighter's undisputed super lightweight title on July 20, but that fight has also been pushed to the Paul vs. Tyson card set for November 15.\n\nThe rest of the event also includes a pair of 135 lbs. matchups between unbeaten fighters when Tony Aguilar takes on Corey Marksman and Ashton Sylve meets Lucas Bahdi. Former UFC middleweight contender Uriah Hall will also step into the boxing ring for the second time to take on former WBC Middleweight Champion Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Jr., and fans will be treated to a number of other entertaining matchups earlier in the night during the prelims.\n\nAll fighters successfully made weight for their respective bouts in Tampa, although there was a brief scare when Paul initially weighed-in heavy before he hit 200 lbs. on his second attempt.\n\nThe prelims for \"Fear No Man\" are set to kick off on YouTube at 6:30 p.m. ET on Saturday night before the

The undefeated bare-knuckle champion and former mixed martial arts (MMA) star will headline the \"Fear No Man\" promotion with Paul, the former child actor-turned-professional YouTuber who is controversially now the face of boxing.\n\nHowever, the co-main event features a Tampa native, Stevie \"Sledgehammer\" Morgan. The Gaither High School graduate will attempt to dethrone top-ranked women's boxing pioneer Amanda \"The Real Deal\" Serrano.\n\n\"I was just talking to my coach about this - every fighter's dream is to have a big fight like this in your hometown,\" Morgan told the Catalyst. \"That's like the top of the mountain. So, it means a lot.\"\n\nFans of the \"sweet science\" will also appreciate marque boxing returning to Tampa Bay. The area's last big event featured Jake Paul defeating former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) star Tyron Woodley, in December 2021.\n\nMorgan expects to have a large contingent in her corner. The local underdog will need that support against one of the best pound-for-pound boxers in the sport's history.\n\nMorgan was a 23-year-old single mother in 2014 when she launched \"Cater Me Fit,\" a meal delivery service. The business grew to include over 30 employees, and the woman now known as Sledgehammer garnered local praise for her entrepreneurialism.\n\nA multi-sport athlete at Gaither, Morgan began focusing on boxing full-time after the pandemic decimated her business. She turned pro in 2022 and quickly moved up the ranks with her ambidextrous power.\n\n\"My team had a plan for me from the beginning,\" Morgan said. \"My job was just to work hard and listen and follow the plan, and that's what has got me into this position.\"\n\nThat position is near-top billing on a stacked card that will cost fans $69 to stream on DAZN pay-per-view. Morgan (14-1, 13 KOs) has fought six times since October, winning every one via first-round knockout.\n\nSerrano (46-21, 30 KOs) is an undisputed champ with nine world titles in seven weight classes. Morgan has compared the fight to a \"real-life Rocky-Apollo Creed movie.\"\n\nWhile she is still relatively unknown, the sport's various governing bodies include Morgan in their Top 10 rankings. She said a victory in front of her home crowd \"will do everything for my career.\"\n\n\"This is what we do it for,\" Morgan added. \"You want to compete against the best. There was no hesitation. I've been waiting for an opportunity, preparing for an opportunity like this since day one.\"\n\nShe also noted the event's local impact. Champion boxers like St. Petersburg's Winky Wright, Jeff \"Left Hook\" Lacy and Tampa's Antonio Tarver represented the region throughout the early-to-mid-2000s. \"I hope I can be added to that list,\" Morgan said.\n\nShe said a lack of opportunities and exposure impedes a \"ton of talent\" in Tampa Bay. However, Morgan believes Most Valuable Promotions (MVP), the event's organizers, can uplift the local boxing community like it has in Orlando.\n\nPaul, who co-founded MVP, also has local ties. Tampa-based Venture firm Florida Funders invested in his sports betting app, Betr, for the fifth time in March.\n\nTampaBay.Ventures, another local investment firm, participated in Betr's initial funding rounds. Paul was initially scheduled to face Mike Tyson in Dallas as part of a Netflix special tonight, but pivoted when the 58-year-old boxing legend postponed the fight until November due to health issues.\n\nThe controversial Paul will now face a much younger opponent who recently told the \"Problem Child\" he would \"dig through your eyeballs and find your memories.\" In a separate interview, Perry noted that \"people have been waiting to see him get beat up.\"\n\n\"I've been knocking down champions, and so has he, so we both earned this spot and limelight we're going to be in,\" Perry added. \"I bring the heat when I fight, so I think it will be something everyone can enjoy.\n\n\"It's not as brutal as bare-knuckle - there might not be as much blood. I'm going to try, though. I'm going to try to make him bleed.\"\n\nAfter flaming out as a mixed martial artist, Perry has resurrected his combat sports career in the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship (BKFC). Unlike other former UFC fighters Paul has faced in the ring, Perry has always fought better on his feet and remains in his prime.\n\nYahoo Sports recently noted that Perry, the self-proclaimed \"king of violence,\" approaches fights as if his \"only goal is blood on the floor - and he's not too particular about whose it is.\"\n\nPerry (5-0, 3KOs BKFC) now considers himself a \"Florida boy.\" He named his son Ocean due to his affinity for the water and credited the sunshine, \"Latinas\" and \"living free\" for his permanent relocation.\n\n\"I'm just looking forward to putting on a good fight here as a local,\" Perry said. \"I don't think he's (Paul) fought someone with the power and pressure I'm going to bring.\"\n\nPerry has earned several accolades since eschewing gloves and hopes his performance Saturday night uplifts the BKFC. The event's top fighters will likely earn over a million dollars, although Perry insists the fight is more than a payday.\n\n\"I'm looking to disrespect Jake (Paul) all night long at Amalie Arena,\" he said. \"I want to disrespect this kid all over the ring.\"\n\nTickets range from around $40 to nearly $6,000. The main event begins at 9 p.m. with boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. clashing with former MMA star Uriah Hall.", "source": {"uri": "stpetecatalyst.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St Pete

Fighters will also use five-ounce gloves \"for more impact power while maintaining some protection to avoid broken knuckles and fingers.\"\n\nThe new sport will also \"focus on finishes,\" disallowing grappling, kicking or submissions.

Perry will start as the underdog and will hope he can transition from bare-knuckle boxing where he has won five fights by stoppage.\n\nAmanda Serrano vs Stevie Morgan - 4.15am\n\nAmanda Serrano was scheduled to rematch Katie Taylor tonight but when Jake Paul's bout with Mike Tyson was rescheduled, the undisputed world champion insisted she remained on the card. She will still face Taylor in November but first must defend her four belts against Stevie Morgan who has lost just one of her 15 bouts.\n\nAshton Sylve vs Lucas Bahdi - 3.30am\n\nAshton Sylve is signed to Jake Paul's Most Valuable Promotions company and has been backed to go all the way.

Green went into her world title challenge undefeated in 13 fights but was dominated over 10 rounds as she lost on points. Natasha Spence should prove a much easier task having won just eight of her 12 pro fights.\n\nAlexis Chaparro vs Kevin Hill - 12.30am\n\nAlexis Chaparro and Kevin Hill open the show with just three fights between them.

Still fighting over six rounds, Barrientes will be looking to progress sooner rather than later.\n\nAriel Perez vs Dane Guerrero - 11.30pm\n\nAriel Perez fights for just the fourth time as a professional having won his first three, two by stoppage.

Mike Tyson clash", "body": "Jake Paul is one of the biggest names on the influencer boxing scene, and he's planning a big 2024.\n\nThe controversial YouTuber, aka 'The Problem Child' has two fights lined up across the rest of the year, as he looks to continue his boxing career.\n\nSince the YouTuber-turned-boxer made his professional debut, he has blown away most of his opponents.\n\nHe is fast becoming a huge name in the sport, and with Mike Tyson in his sights, talkSPORT.com has looked into Paul's career so far and who he's facing next.\n\nPaul started his professional career by knocking out a fellow YouTuber in Miami back in January 2020.\n\nThe American floored his UK social media foe Gib three times in the opener, causing the referee to stop the obvious mismatch.\n\nFew predicted just how one-sided the bout would turn out to be, with Gib having previously won his two white collar contests.\n\nPaul next knocked out former NBA star Robinson in the second round of a rather bizarre fight in November 2020.\n\nThe ex-Vine star settled his feud with the NBA great on the undercard of Mike Tyson's comeback exhibition against Roy Jones Jr.\n\nPaul scored his first knockdown in the first round before he sent Robinson to the canvas twice more following several devastating right hands.\n\nPaul made light work of another UFC star by knocking Ben Askren out in the first round of their fight.\n\nThe former Disney Channel actor flattened ex-welterweight Askren with a right hand inside the opening two minutes to claim an emphatic victory.\n\nA nice jab set-up Paul's overhand right and despite Askren getting up, the referee called it day with 'Funky' looking unsteady on his feet.\n\nPaul's toughest fight to that point was his first showdown against Woodley in Cleveland as he went the distance for the first time in his career.\n\nHe secured the win by split decision and couldn't hide his delight after winning 77-75, 75-77, 78-74 on the scorecards.\n\nPaul's second bout with Woodley more straight forward as he knocked out the 40-year-old with one punch in their rematch.\n\nPaul then beat Anderson Silva by unanimous decision in their exhibition fight in the USA.\n\nThe 25-year-old maintained his flawless professional record against the UFC legend, moving to 6-0, with the judges giving scores of 77-74, 78-73 and 78-73.\n\nThis was Paul's toughest fight to date and after a hard-fought six rounds, he made his statement in the seventh.\n\nHe knocked down Silva with a strong right hand, winning the final round which ended up proving to be all-important.\n\nNext came his first career defeat to Tommy Fury in early 2023.\n\nAfter months of digs and barbs, the Brit and the American finally met in Saudi Arabia.\n\nPaul knocked Fury down in the eighth round, but Tyson Fury's half-brother won via a split decision, with the judges scoring the contest 76-73, 76-73 and 74-75 in favour of the Brit.\n\nThis put Paul on 6-1, and was a serious setback.\n\nHowever, he's bounced back and has won his last three fights comprehensively.\n\nNext up was UFC legend Nate Diaz.\n\nThe American elected not to extend his UFC contract in 2022, and he moved into boxing.\n\nPaul stepped into the ring just three months after his defeat to Fury and won via unanimous decision.\n\nIn truth, it wasn't close as the judges scored it 97-92, 98-91 and 98-91.\n\nBut The Problem Child wasn't done there for 2023 as he faced a third different opponent of the year in Andre August.\n\nAugust was an unknown professional boxer, but he was viciously knocked out by Paul inside the first round.\n\nThe end came when Paul followed a left-handed jab with a brutal uppercut that floored his opponent.\n\nPaul's most recent fight came in March 2024 against Ryan Bourland.\n\nAgain, his opponent proved to be no match as he recorded a first-round TKO.\n\nBourland offered little resistance as Paul laid into him for a full minute before the referee waved it off.\n\nOf the ten professional fights Paul has competed in, he's won nine with one defeat.\n\nHe has claimed six victories via knockout or TKO.\n\nAhead of his comfortable win over Bourland, Paul weighed in at 199.8lbs, and despite an early scare, he's hit weight at 200lbs for his next fight.\n\nThe 27-year-old stands at 6ft 1 [185cm] and has a reach of 76in [193cm].\n\nPaul was meant to face Mike Tyson next, but the former undiputed heavyweight champion of the world had to pull out due to medical concerns.\n\nAs a result, Mike Perry has stepped in.\n\nThis will be just his second professional boxing match, and it's set to take place on Saturday, July 20.\n\nShould Paul come through that, the long-awaited bout with Tyson has been scheduled for later in the year.\n\nShould there be no further delays, that fight will take place on Friday, November 15.\n\nIt is set to be held the 80,000-capacity AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas and will be streamed on Netflix.\n\nPaul sees nothing but an easy KO against Perry.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the bout, he said: \"You're going to smell good when you get knocked the f*** out,\" he told his opponent. \"Two rounds, max. I mean, two rounds max.\n\n\"Let's be honest, brother. He's just not a boxer. I've elevated to such a high level. People haven't even seen my ability over the last year because I've gotten first-round knockouts.\n\n\"There's no film, there's nothing people can study out there for him to prepare for what I'm going to bring to the table.\n\n\"I'm just too sharp, too clean, I punch way too hard, power in both hands and he makes a lot of mistakes. There's nothing he can do.\n\n\"I respect him. He's very violent. It's not taking away from Mike Perry. He could beat a lot of people but he can't beat me.\"", "source": {"uri": "talksport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "talkSPORT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_brophy@talksport.com", "name": "Joe

Instead, he has opted to stay busy by facing the bare-knuckle boxing star, who used to compete at 170lb in the UFC.\n\nPaul reportedly had to get his weight down from 230lb at his peak during camp for the Tyson fight in order to make his way down to cruiserweight. And he just about completed the task this morning in order to accurately tip the scales.\n\nDuring this morning's early weigh-ins, Jake Paul headed to the scales accompanied by a large entourage. The then stepped on in just a pair of black shorts emblazoned with the logo for his new personal care brand 'W'.\n\nHe came in at an initial check weight of 200.2lb, which was misinterpreted by some as him missing weight at the first time of asking. However, when he returned to the scale without his shorts, he was declared to be 200lb even, meaning he made weight for the fight.\n\nPaul proceeded to celebrate making weight with what has become a routine at this point; declaring that he is 'fully dialled' and asking media 'you like that?' The latter is an homage to Atlanta Falcons quarter-back Kirk Cousins.\n\nIn the meantime, the much smaller Mike Perry appeared in great spirits as he came in looking healthy at a career-highest 196.6lb. It's almost 30lb heavier than his boxing debut in 2015 against Kenneth McNeil, and more than 12lb over his last BKFC weigh-in when he faced Thiago Alves in April.\n\nAfter the postponement of Paul vs Tyson, the YouTuber-turned-boxer insisted that he stay busy and continue to fight on July 20 as planned. In the days following their announcement of a new November 15 date, his team at Most Valuable Promotions put together this weekend's bout with Perry.\n\nHowever, one key issue was a weight class, with the former welterweight likely only able to keep his weight as high as cruiserweight. They opted for cruiserweight, which meant that Paul had to make a relatively quick cut to the new limit.\n\nHis former coach Shane Mosley had claimed that in order to compete at heavyweight with Tyson, Paul had ballooned to around 230lb. This was later confirmed, meaning that he had to cut 30lb in order to make weight for the showdown with Perry.\n\nShould he get through tomorrow night's bout as expected, all eyes will be on November 15 and the AT&T Stadium in Texas. Paul will face former world heavyweight champion Tyson at the massive venue, with the bout serving as the first live boxing fight on Netflix.\n\n\"A lot of people think I'm crazy for pivoting to this,\" Paul told DAZN. \"Why Mike Perry, why now, why take the risk, you could lose the biggest payday of your life against Mike Tyson if you lose to Mike Perry who is a violent killer, a bare-knuckle, undefeated legend over there.\"\n\nHe reiterated that idea during an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show this week, and defended Tyson continuing to fight deep into his 50s. \"I view it as, say it to Mike Tyson's face and see what he does to you,\" Paul explained.\n\n\"The one reporter who was discrediting him, he was about to jump over the press conference table and beat the dude's a**. We aren't Mike Tyson's dad. We don't control Mike Tyson. He's his own boss.\n\n\"If he wants to go in there and make tens of millions of dollars, and potentially end my run, then who are we to stop him? This guy has been doing this his whole entire life. He's a natural-born killer, and this is what he loves, and maybe this is what he needs.\n\n\"So, yeah, the age is a thing, but I believe it's the equalizer because he has more experience, but I have the youth, and the speed, maybe, to be able to put him down.\"", "source": {"uri": "bloodyelbow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bloody Elbow"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiserweight_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cruiserweight (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare-knuckle_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bare-knuckle boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Alves_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Alves (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weight class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Mosley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shane Mosley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_McAfee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat McAfee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AT&T Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAZN", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DAZN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloodyelbow.com/wp-content/uploads/1/2024/07/Jake-Paul-Mike-Perry-weigh-in.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 1788, "textEnd": 1795}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-15", "textStart": 1858, "textEnd": 1869, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Perry, who will be taking on Jake Paul this weekend in his second-ever professional boxing bout, seems quite confident of his chances. At the same time, some fans are pretty vocal about their support for Paul, although the 'Chupapi influencer' took things a bit too far.\n\nFor the uninitiated, \"Chupapi Munyayo\" or \"Chupapi Mu\u00f1a\u00f1yo\" is a phrase popularised by Ferrer. The phrase itself is essentially gibberish and doesn't have a specific meaning in any language. Ferrer usually uses this term when he sneaks up on people and yells this into their ears.\n\nThe Tiktoker carried out the same prank on an unsuspecting Mike Perry who was standing backstage. Ferrer snuck up on the boxer from behind and yelled into his ear that Jake Paul would win. Startled, Perry turned around and pushed the Tiktoker away, before the BKFC star's security team kicked him out of the premises.\n\nHowever, the scenario could have played out very differently had Perry not taken so kindly to the prank, and it did not take long for the video to go viral on social media. Naturally, people loved how the MMA star put Ferrer in his place and poured in with some hilarious reactions.\n\n\"How do people find this funny? Like it would have been funny if Mike hit him with a right hand\"- commented a fan praising Perry's restraint.\n\nAnother fan added, \"This social media influencers need to learn respect.\"\n\nInterestingly, while Perry tried to keep his cool during his altercation with the Tiktok star, his final face-off against Paul was the complete opposite.\n\nThe final face-off between Perry and Paul got extremely heated as the two men did not go easy on the trash talk. Perry insisted that he was coming to take off Paul's head and had nothing but violence in store for the 27-year-old.\n\nSurprisingly, Paul chose a different route of attack as he bashed Conor McGregor and other MMA Fighters. He taunted Perry, claiming that all MMA artists were horrible boxers and he could not wait to put another one in his place this weekend.\n\nEven though security had to step in soon after following a push from Paul, it is evident that both fighters will give it their all when they step into the ring this weekend.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_binoy@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Kevin Binoy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conor McGregor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/07/40439cf7-untitled-design.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

This event was supposed to see Paul taking on Mike Tyson. Unfortunately (?) \"Iron\" Mike suffered a medical emergency, forcing him to withdraw from the contest. The pair are supposed to resume hostilities in November (I wouldn't bet on that happening, though).\n\n\"Platinum\" Perry is the man who has been selected to fill in for the former Heavyweight champ. Perry was a long-time UFC Welterweight who has since found his groove in bareknuckle boxing (lighting up Thiago Alves in BKFC most recently).\n\nLet's checkout the money lines on \"Paul vs. Perry\" and most of the other bouts on the card\n\n...\n\nThe odds on this bout have grown quite a lot since opening. Initially we had Jake Paul as a -250 favorite and Mike Perry as a +200 underdog (per Pro Boxing Odds). With Paul's odds shortening to -428 it's clear that the public thinks that initial price was too high and that Paul is likely to get the win over his short notice replacement.\n\nIt's hard to know whether the betting public that follows Paul fights are knowledgeable or not, though. There might be a lot of 'fan money' flowing his way, with Gen Zs convinced the man they follow on Tik Tok will beat anyone who is put in front of him.\n\nWe've seen this kind of line movement with Paul before. In both of his recent squash matches his line decreased by between 5 and 7 percent. Against both Tommy Fury and Anderson Silva Paul's line decreased by 7.7 and 10.6% with him closing as a slight favorite in those bouts. Against Nate Diaz his odds actually rose by 1.7% to see him close as a -400 favorite.\n\nI personally think Paul will win this bout, so I understand a lot of folks jumping on that -250 line. I think -400 is a little too short for this bout, though. I can see a path to victory for Perry, where he's able to pressure Paul into mistakes and frustrate him with all his activity. However, I do think that, ultimately, the most likely outcome is Paul plays keep-away with his chin, using his reach advantage, and pot shots his way to a boring decision.\n\nAmanda Serrano is a massive favorite here against Stevie Morgan. Morgan doesn't have the skill or experience to pose a serious test to Serrano, who is taking an easy assignment to stay busy while she waits to try and avenge her loss to Kate Taylor. These lines have barely moved because neither are enticing enough for the public to put money down on. Serrano is so certain to win that Vegas have basically taken her off the table for most betters. Morgan's +1600 looks nice on paper, but her odds are only that high because she stands no chance in this match-up.\n\nThe only shift of note in this line happened on July 17 when Serrano's odds suddenly dipped to -4286 and then popped up to -3871),\n\nAshton Sylve is a decent sized favorite in this match-up. Sylve belongs to Paul's Most Valuable Promotions and he has been given a platform, both in the ring and on social media, to make himself a star with those who follow 'influencer boxing'. To his credit, he's more boxer than influencer and he has some decent skills, as proven by his fantastic body shot TKO in his last bout. Lucas Baldi is a solid pro and the biggest test Sylve has faced. However, he's on the wrong side of 30 and he likely won't be able to keep up with the speedy Sylve. As you can see by the line movement, the public felt Vegas had it just right with their opening line.\n\nTony Aguilar and Corey Marksman fought to a draw in February. Marksman is the more powerful puncher and he was able to land the hardest punches in his first fight with Aguilar. He came on strong late in the fight after Aguilar took a number of the early rounds. The public must have felt Marksman was a little short changed on the draw decision in February. There has been a steady flow of money pushing him from a -170 favorite to a -225 favorite. I agree with the public that Marksman is a worthy favorite in this bout and he should be too technical for Aguilar in their second meeting.\n\nJulio Cesar Chavez Jr. opened as a -215 favorite and the public seems to think he deserves shorter odds than that. Money on the former WBC Middleweight champ has shortened his odds by around 10%. Uriah Hall opened as +170 and those have grown by almost 20%.\n\nI can understand why the public might be fading Hall. He's an aging MMA vet who looked just OK in his only pro boxing bout to date -- a ho-hum decision win over former NFL running back La'Veon Bell. Hall is also coming in on short notice.\n\nHowever, Chavez Jr. might be someone who fights down to his opponent, like he did when Anderson Silva beat him in 2021. Chavez Jr. has had an awful 2024 so far, too. He's been arrested for possessing an illegal assault rifle (after a 911 caller told police he might be a danger to himself) and he's had a stint in rehab for drugs and alcohol use. He's also been embroiled in a bitter feud with his Boxing Hall of Fame father Julio Cesar Chavez Sr. The younger Chavez has accused his dad for beating his mother and conspiring to kill him.\n\nGiven all these distractions I'm happy to take a chance on Hall getting the upset here.\n\nThe biggest line movement for this card features Mike Perry, whose opening odds of +200 have ballooned to +338. Perry's line may be a victim of Paul's notoriety, with Paul fans flocking to back the vanguard of the influencer boxing movement. Perry will also have a pretty significant size and reach disadvantage against Paul (who has proven a bit of a size bully in his boxing career thus far). If you like Perry in this match-up, you're probably delighted to see his odds grow. It's probably wise to wait a little longer to see if they can go any higher.\n\nIf you like betting on underdogs there aren't many decent opportunities to do that on this card. My favorite dog is Uriah Hall. Though he's not as good a boxer as Julio Cesar Chavez Jr., he's not bringing in the same kind of baggage the former WBC Middleweight champ is dragging along with him. If Chavez Jr. doesn't have his mind set on competing he could very well lose to another MMA veteran.\n\nEnough about me, though, which of these underdogs do you like the most?\n\nRemember that MMAmania.com will deliver LIVE round-by-round, blow-by-blow coverage of the entire Jake Paul vs. Mike Perry card right here, starting with YouTube \"Prelims\" matches, which are scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. ET (and right here).

Froch, who reigned as super-middleweight world champion, has gone as far as to call on Paul to face him in the ring.\n\nBut Froch's tone softened following the assassination attempt on Donald Trump last week when he said, \"I'm gonna start to admire you with talk like this\" in response to Paul backing the former president for re-election. Paul clearly failed to notice the interaction however as when asked about Froch's, he said: \"Who is he?

The former undisputed world champion was forced to postpone the fight until November - and Froch has previously been scathing in his criticism of the bout.\n\n\"A young kid being a bully -- what's he getting out of fighting Mike Tyson? What, exactly, does Jake Paul feel that he's achieving by beating a guy who's nearly 60 years old?\" Froch said. \"There's nothing to prove. The guy's well past his best. Finished. Pipe and slippers long, long ago. I mean, he was probably peaking in the early 90s. It's now 30 years on and he's not a boxer anymore. He's settled down, he's finished in the game.\n\n\"Has Jake Paul been badly advised, actually? I mean, whoever's telling Jake Paul that it's a good idea to fight Mike Tyson -- Jake Paul's fighting an old man, so if he wins, he's beaten an old man.

He crossed over from making YouTube videos to knocking down opponents in the ring. The younger Paul went on to get a six-fight win streak in boxing. However, February 26, 2023, was a forgettable day for 'The Problem Child.'\n\nPaul's undefeated streak came to an end in a surprising turn of events. This came in the form of none other than Tommy Fury, the half-brother of former heavyweight champion Tyson Fury. Tommy was riding on an 8-fight undefeated streak. Notably, the bout took place in Saudi Arabia, far from Paul's usual stomping grounds.\n\nThe fight was a clash of social media titans turned fighters. Paul had been riding high on a wave of victories against ex-MMA fighters like Anderson Silva and Tyron Woodley. But Fury presented a unique challenge altogether. He was a professional boxer trained to outbox and outpoint his opponents.\n\nThe fight wasn't a knockout spectacle. Instead, it was a closely contested split decision. Fury's boxing pedigree showed as he outmaneuvered Paul for most of the fight. He crowded Paul early, using his movement to avoid the YouTuber's powerful overhand right. Paul, to his credit, didn't go down without a fight. He even scored a knockdown in the eighth round.\n\nBut in the end, two out of three judges favored Fury's performance. Paul's undefeated record was no more. He took the loss with surprising grace. It was a humbling moment for the cocky YouTuber who once hinted at fighting Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez. This loss, however, added a new chapter to Paul's boxing story.\n\nCelebrity boxing has become a new norm in combat sports, and it never fails to entertain. There is a lot of money to be made in these types of fights. Paul is arguably the face of celebrity boxing. He was undefeated until he met Tommy in the ring. Paul, who is known for never backing down, called him out once again.\n\nThis time, Paul's team waved a whopping $20 million offer in Tommy's face. They revealed that Tyson Fury's half-brother was potentially missing out on this massive payday because he was not jumping at the chance for a rematch. And Paul wasn't just offering a boxing rematch. He sweetened the deal with an MMA twist.\n\nThe proposal was that an MMA fight would follow a boxing rematch in the PFL cage if Paul won in the rematch. Paul's business partner, Nakisa Bidarian, laid out the enticing path for Tommy. It could lead to nearly $20 million in guaranteed money. But Fury seemed to be playing hard to get. Paul believed Tommy's team didn't understand the business side of boxing. He might have a point, or maybe Fury's not that into him.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zaid_quraishi@totalprosports.com", "name": "Zaid Quraishi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyson_Fury", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyson Fury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fury", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_Child_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Problem Child (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTuber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTuber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_decision", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Split decision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyron_Woodley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyron Woodley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anderson Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canelo_\u00c1lvarez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canelo \u00c1lvarez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Fighters_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Fighters League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Jake-Paul-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Like Silva before him, MMA fans were hoping Diaz would bring an end to Paul's boxing career, which up until that point, was built on a foundation of shopworn UFC fighters like Ben Askren and Tyron Woodley.\n\nBoth were sent back to the clearance rack after violent knockout losses.\n\nThat's why it's getting a little cringey to hear marquee UFC fighters beg for boxing matches. If former cage-fighting megastars like Silva and Diaz -- renowned for their hands -- can't beat a twenty-something social media star, who jumped off the couch and took a celebrity boxing match to keep pace with his brother's combat sports stunts, then what chance does any MMA fighter have in the \"sweet science\" against a battle-tested pugilist?\n\nI thought Francis Ngannou had the answer ... until he didn't.\n\nThere have been exceptions, like Anthony Pettis beating Roy Jones Jr. and Vitor Belfort stopping Evander Holyfield. It's just hard to take those wins seriously when you consider Jones Jr. is 55 and Holyfield is 61. With that in mind, defenders of the MMA faith may have finally found their savior in the form of ex-UFC welterweight Mike Perry, who continues to ply his trade as a bareknuckle boxer for Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship (BKFC).\n\nCall him the uncrowned (and perhaps accidental) \"King\" of violence.\n\nPerry was called up to battle Paul this Sat. night (July 20) on DAZN pay-per-view (PPV) in what \"El Gallo\" is hoping to be a quick warmup for his Mike Tyson fight this November on Netflix. Cart before the horse? Consider that Conor McGregor -- dreaming of a pugilistic payday opposite Manny Pacquiao -- had that same philosophy ahead of his Dustin Poirier fight at UFC 257, only to overlook \"The Diamond\" and get knocked the f -- k out.\n\nMcGregor's attempt to right the ship at UFC 264 ended in disaster.\n\nLet's not gloss over the fact that Perry was a middling UFC fighter who had a tremendous amount of bark (but very little bite) when it came time to perform. It's been seven years since his last knockout inside the cage and following that first-round finish, \"Platinum\" was a dreadful 3-7, dropping four of his last five before hitting the open market.\n\nBKFC, like most other combat sports promotions, helped build its brand with fighters who were no longer successful (or no longer wanted) inside the Octagon. With the exception of Michael Page, all of Perry's BKFC wins featured UFC leftovers coming off losses, like Luke Rockhold and Eddie Alvarez, among others. Perry is still relatively young at 32 and let's face it, some of his much-older opponents just wanted a quick paycheck.\n\nJake Paul is 27 years old and takes his boxing career seriously, even if you don't.\n\nThat might be one of many reasons why the combat sports community is so disgusted by Paul. He's only here because of his social media fame, and successful \"influencers\" are widely-regarded as opportunists who didn't pay their dues. I'm sure it's hard for aging MMA fighters who bodysurfed waves of their own blood just for a chance to compete under the UFC banner -- where pay starts as low as $10k per fight -- to watch some cocky YouTube smartass waltz in and score beaucoup bucks.\n\nWhat are they doing wrong?\n\nNothing, per se, but it's time to accept the fighting landscape has changed and it may be more uneven now than it ever was, thanks to new (and sometimes obnoxious) paths to stardom. The MMA industry remains insecure as a whole, which is understandable when you consider how long it took for \"cock fighters\" to be seen as legitimate athletes -- not muscled-up \"skinheads and homosexuals.\"\n\nIt wasn't that long ago when UFC was banned in New York.\n\nThat's why the presence of Paul and his many antics can seem threatening to MMA. Fighting is a serious endeavor and carries a very real danger of death and serious injury. There's also the respect factor, which can sometimes border on parody, but it's no secret that most UFC fighters want to be both feared and admired for their violent attributes.\n\nThat's a pretty tall order when Jake Paul is the face of combat sports.\n\nMaybe Perry will restore order and send \"El Gallo\" back to the YouTube circuit, where he can reignite his feud with longtime rival KSI. The more likely scenario is that Perry, who was knocked out in his one-and-only pro boxing bout, will realize his usual nuke first, collect paychecks later approach doesn't translate well to boxing, where subtly and nuance are still potent weapons in high-stakes prize fights.", "source": {"uri": "mmamania.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MMAmania.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Paul was 20 years old at the time, with a significant size advantage over his 26-year-old opponent for the day.\n\nThe video came in the form of Paul's first-known footage competing in MMA or boxing, previously having been pictured in high school wrestling tournaments. And while he clearly struggled under Agazarm's constant pressure, he showed fight fans a taste of what was to come in the near future with his 'large and in charge' combinations and angle work.\n\nPaul found himself smothered in the first round of the sparring session, kept at range by AJ before being taken to the ground, mounted and dominated. Helped back to his feet at the end of the round, Paul was breathing heavily and incredibly gassed out, going on to meet his demise in the second.\n\nWhile Paul would find success on the feet, landing a heavy right cross early on, Agazarm was able to shoot for and complete another takedown, make his way into a mount, and submit the YouTuber via a well-executed armbar. Agazarm would sign for Bellator in 2019, building a 3-2 record with the MMA promotion despite losing to Jesse Roberts in his debut.\n\nPaul, meanwhile, would win his amateur boxing debut with Deji with a fifth-round TKO before kicking off a pro career in 2020 with a first-round TKO of fellow YouTuber AnEsonGib. He has built a 9-1 record in the last four years, beating UFC stars Nate Diaz, Ben Askren, Anderson Silva and Tyron Woodley twice - his only loss coming in the form of a narrow split decision loss to Tommy Fury in February 2023.\n\nWhile he was scheduled to take on Mike Tyson this weekend, his 58-year-old boxing great opponent was forced to pull out of the bout earlier this year due to medical concerns, with Paul now set to take on 5-0 BKFC star Mike Perry come July 20 in his toughest test to date. But boxing isn't the only sport that Paul is eyeing up a career in, signing a ground-breaking MMA deal with the Professional Fighters League last January.\n\nSpeaking at the time of the announcement, Paul said: \"I've proven myself in and out of the boxing ring and now I am going to do the same in MMA, and there is no limit to the positive impact I can make on the sport.\" And while Paul is yet to take to the PFL Smart Cage, a rematch under MMA rules with Diaz could still play out in the near future.\n\nPaul and PFL founder Donn Davis offered Diaz a reported $15million for a PFL super-fight this year, only for the Stockton native to take up a boxing match with former UFC foe Jorge Masvidal. Despite Diaz turning down the opportunity to atone for his boxing loss to Paul in the cage, Paul says that he's still open to the bout.\n\nSpeaking at Wednesday's open workout for his upcoming fight with Perry, Paul said: \"Nate Diaz should've taken my $15 million MMA offer, but yesterday's price is not today's price. So now that he needs the money, the offer goes down. And I'm still down to run it in the PFL against Nate Diaz.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aaron_morris@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Aaron Morris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJ_Agazarm", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AJ Agazarm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brazilian jiu-jitsu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTuber", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "YouTuber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armlock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Armlock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellator_MMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bellator MMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amateur boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KSI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KSI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_belt_(martial_arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black belt (martial arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Fighters_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional Fighters League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Diaz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nate Diaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takedown_(grappling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Takedown (grappling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholastic_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scholastic wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fury", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Masvidal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jorge Masvidal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Askren", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Askren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_decision", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Split decision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyron_Woodley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyron Woodley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anderson Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockton,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stockton, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stockton, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33281040.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_aj-paul-grab-3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 2562, "textEnd": 2569}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-02-", "textStart": 426, "textEnd": 439}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Love him or hate him, the fact can't be denied that he's grabbed the boxing world's attention. With his brash personality and surprising skills, Paul has become a polarizing figure in sports.\n\nThe 27-year-old Ohio native first rose to fame through social media platforms. His transition from internet celebrity to professional boxer raised many eyebrows initially. Critics dismissed calling him a gimmick, but Paul has been determined to prove them wrong. Since his professional debut in 2020, he's been steadily building his boxing resume.\n\nPaul has faced a mix of opponents, from fellow YouTubers to former MMA fighters and professional boxers. His dedication to training and improving his craft has been evident with each fight. His professional record stands at 9 wins with just one loss.\n\nJake Paul's Wins Via Knockouts In His Professional Boxing Career\n\nOut of his nine professional wins, six have come by way of a knockout. That's a pretty impressive KO ratio for someone once dismissed as a mere influencer. Paul's first technical knockout victim was fellow YouTuber Ali Eson Gib, aka AnEsonGib, in January 2020. He followed that up by flattening former NBA player Nate Robinson in November 2020.\n\nPaul's most significant TKO came against former MMA champion Ben Askren. In the first round, he sent Askren to the canvas with a thunderous right hand. Askren got up, but the referee stopped the contest. This victory silenced many critics who doubted Paul could hang with \"real\" fighters.\n\nAnother highlight-reel knockout came in his rematch with former UFC champion Tyron Woodley in December 2021. In the first match, Paul won via a split decision. Paul's face-plant punch left Woodley unconscious on the ropes. It was a statement win that proved his first victory over Woodley wasn't a fluke.\n\nAnother KO victory came against Andre August in December 2023. Paul unleashed a vicious uppercut that sent August crashing to the canvas. It was a reminder that 'The Problem Child' carries legitimate power in his hands. His most recent TKO victory was over Ryan Bourland. He stopped him with a flurry of punches in the first round.\n\nJake Paul will next face Mike Perry on July 20, 2024. It will be interesting to see if 'The Problem Child' will claim his seventh win via knockout in Tampa, Florida.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zaid_quraishi@totalprosports.com", "name": "Zaid Quraishi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimmick_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gimmick (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTuber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTuber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Askren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Askren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nate Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyron_Woodley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyron Woodley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Problem_Child", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Problem Child"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppercut", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uppercut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referee (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_decision", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Split decision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Writers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Writers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Jake-Paul-3-1024x563.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-01-", "textStart": 1195, "textEnd": 1207}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-11-", "textStart": 1278, "textEnd": 1291}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-07-", "textStart": 2262, "textEnd": 2269}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

He started in content creation when monetization was in its infancy, and managed to amass almost two billion views making comedy videos on Vine (RIP), beginning around 2013.\n\nFast-forward a decade, and Paul's consistent work ethic has catapulted him from influencer to entrepreneur to professional boxer. He is fighting former UFC fighter and bare-knuckle-boxing champion Mike Perry in his eighth pro match on Saturday, and taking on Boxing Hall of Famer Mike Tyson on November 15, which will be streamed on Netflix.\n\nPaul, it seems, is no longer just about comedy and pranks.\n\n\"It's just very surreal and it feels like all my hard work is starting to pay off,\" Paul tells Entrepreneur over a video call. \"I'm very honored to be in the ring with Mike Tyson. After 12 to 15 years of knocking down the door of opportunity, I was able to open this door. So it just goes to show that you have to start with one step at a time and grow into things like these, that you can't even believe you're doing.\"\n\nWhen the Tyson fight was announced, Paul emerged as the favorite to win. But his response wasn't one of an untouchable heavyweight -- he's just happy to be here. And yes, he says he is scared to fight Tyson.\n\n\"Fear is always going to be there, you're always going to be scared,\" Paul said. \"I'm scared to fight Mike Tyson. I'm scared to fight Mike Perry. It's about being brave enough to have the courage to do it when the fear is never going away. You have to embrace it and let it fuel you versus let it stop you from maybe making the best decision of your life.\"\n\nStill, he hasn't been without controversy. Business Insider reports allegations of online scams, abusive behavior, and vandalism.\n\nHis videos filming protests during the pandemic in 2020 led to the FBI raiding his home in 2021 in connection to a looting incident at an Arizona shopping mall. Paul was charged with trespassing and unlawful assembly.\n\nFollowing an investigation, the U.S. Attorney's Office ruled that he would not face federal charges.\n\nAround the same time, Paul had tension with the mayor of Calabasas, California, when he threw a massive party during the pandemic, despite social distancing restrictions.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Paul didn't step away from the spotlight and took it as a learning lesson. Paul's net worth is now an estimated $34.3 million.\n\nPaul owns four businesses -- sportsbook app Betr, VC fund Antifund, sports promotion company Most Valuable Promotions -- and now his latest, a men's body care line, W, sold direct-to-consumer at Walmart, which launched in June.\n\n\"I started not knowing what anything was, I just learned a little every single day, accumulated knowledge, applied all my learnings, and worked harder than my peers,\" Paul said.\n\nPaul likens W products to \"a new, better version of Axe for millennials.\"\n\n\"These old legacy brands that we're going up against are companies owned by massive conglomerates. We're coming in with a new game plan, and a new way to market,\" Paul added. \"There's so much room to grow and to change things here and to innovate on a product that can connect with a younger audience of men, which is my audience.\"\n\nRelated: Ringside Tyson-Paul Fight VIP Tickets Selling for Millions\n\nPaul's marketing techniques are not for everyone (he was nearly attacked by a shark, and filmed a lie detector test on Instagram), but they feel authentic to who he is and his already hyper-online social media presence.\n\n\"I think people should be themselves. Authenticity is what's winning, show your failure, show your mistakes, tell your story,\" Paul said. \"The struggle is what people can relate to, and I think that's what's missing with a lot of entrepreneurs.\"\n\nPaul says when he was making videos on Vine as a teen a decade ago, he anticipated how big the influencer economy could be one day. He was right: A recent report from Emarketer projected that U.S. marketer spending on sponsored social-media content could rise 16% this year to $8.14 billion.\n\n\"[Back then], the numbers spoke for themselves,\" he said. \"We were Viners getting millions of views on our Vines and getting paid like $2,000 for a video, but a commercial slot on TV would get maybe 500,000 views, and they get paid $100,000 or $200,000.\"\n\nPaul said he knew eventually that numbers \"would be the most important thing,\" and that influencers and creators would become more valued. \"And that's becoming true,\" he added.\n\nPaul says his first paycheck was for $300, and he spent it on Christmas-edition LeBron James sneakers and a Diesel watch.\n\n\"You have to embrace it and let it fuel you versus let it stop you from maybe making the best decision of your life.\"\n\nTransitioning into the business world didn't come without a slew of haters, either.\n\n\"I [was] scared to put W into the world to see how people are going to receive it,\" he said.\n\nPaul says that he heard a quote years ago about entrepreneurs being the best at sweeping their mistakes under the rug, learning, and moving on, and he tries to remember that when things get tough.\n\n\"It hasn't been easy at all, it's difficult every single day still,\" Paul said.\n\nRelated: Jake Paul Reportedly Earned Sky-High Amount for Fight\n\nAnd he may just be fighting his old reputation for a while: After all, he knows the Internet is forever.\n\n\"I want people to look at me as an example of the American dream, of relentlessly pursuing my dreams for over a decade and never stopping when I fell flat on my face and persevering through all of those moments,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "entrepreneur.com", "dataType": "news",

Speaking to Ariel Helwani on The MMA Hour, Bidarian admitted that the idea of an interfamily bout between the two brothers was floated to Netflix after Tyson was pulled through medical concerns.\n\nSpeaking about trying to make a Logan and Jake fight work, Bidarian explained on Wednesday: \"We said to Netflix, we could get the two of them to agree to do it on July 20th on Netflix. I think Netflix saw it as a phenomenal, massive event, with not enough run-up [time] to do it the right way.\"\n\nInstead of pushing for a bout between the two brothers, Netflix would instead opt to reserve their initial scheduled bout between Jake and Tyson, rescheduling for November 15. Eager to still compete this month, Jake instead worked a deal with DAZN to fight 14-8 UFC and BKFC star Perry come July 20.\n\nAnd while we could have seen Jake and Logan throw down in a mega-fight for the ages this weekend, Bidarian is confident that the fight will definitely take place at some point down the line. He added: \"They have the utmost love for each other, but there is a competitive nature between them, absolutely. This is an older brother, younger brother dynamic always, right? And I do believe you'll see that fight at some point. And there is not one ounce of wrestling in it. It is 100 percent real.\"\n\nJake Paul has accrued a coveted 9-1 boxing record since turning pro back in 2020 - beating former UFC stars like Ben Askren, Nate Diaz, Anderson Silva and Tyron Woodley twice. His only loss came to the hands of Tommy Fury - brother of Tyson Fury - in February last year via split decision.\n\nPerry, on the other hand, is currently riding a 5-0 win streak with bare-knuckle promotion BKFC, racking up wins over the likes of Eddie Alvarez and Luke Rockhold. He has also been involved in some of the bloodiest battles in UFC history, with wins over Paul Felder, Mickey Gall, Alex Reyes and Jake Ellenberger.\n\nLogan, meanwhile, has had a far less active boxing career, with just two pro bouts to his name over the years. He made his pro debut against YouTube star KSI in 2018, losing via split decision, before taking on Dillon Danis in October 2023 - where he would achieve a DQ victory after frustrating the Bellator star over the course of six rounds.\n\nDanis would attempt to get Paul in a guillotine before rushing the 29-year-old after the final bell had rang, leading to an all-out ring invasion as officials and cornermen tried to get the situation under control. Logan's most notable bout, however, would come in the form of a 2021 exhibition with 50-0 Floyd Mayweather Jr - going the distance with the boxing GOAT over eight rounds while holding his own.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aaron_morris@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Aaron Morris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montel_Vontavious_Porter", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Montel Vontavious Porter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Ellenberger", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Ellenberger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMA_Fighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MMA Fighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Helwani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ariel Helwani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Promoter (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPY_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPY Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyson_Fury", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyson Fury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAZN", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DAZN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dillon_Danis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dillon Danis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KSI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KSI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Felder", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Felder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Gall", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mickey Gall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cornerman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Askren", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Askren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_decision", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Split decision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Alvarez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Alvarez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Rockhold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Rockhold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellator_MMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bellator MMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyron_Woodley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyron Woodley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anderson Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Diaz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nate Diaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33279032.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Jake-Paul-v-AnEsonGib.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744461", "eventUri": "eng-9744461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 544, "textEnd": 551, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-15", "textStart": 1217, "textEnd": 1228}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

In the US, it will do a strong number, globally both guys have incredible followings in key territories. It's a huge fight.\n\n\"But one of the problems is both guys are quite young and both have big egos. Both guys have opinions about their value and their worth, and that's bigger than the other person.\n\n\"To make a fight like that will take both of them to really want that fight and come together and say, 'Regardless of whether I think I'm a little bit bigger than you, shall we just say it's 50/50 for all the money in the pot and let's make a fortune.'\n\n\"As you become older and more sensible, that's what fighters get to sometimes.

Controversies have arisen at intervals since the American emerged on Vine in 2013, three years before his two-season stint on the Disney Channel series Bizaardvark. Paul, 27, has nevertheless only seen his profile grow in the decade since, with 20 million YouTube subscribers and 25m Instagram followers at the time of writing. Still, he does not identify as a YouTuber or influencer anymore; he's a professional boxer.\n\nIf his knockout win over former NBA star Nate Robinson in 2020 didn't convince you, or his knockouts of MMA stars Tyron Woodley and Ben Askren in 2021, or his decision win over UFC legend Anderson Silva in 2022, then he hoped his fight with Tommy Fury would have. Well, kind of; Paul would argue he doesn't care what you think at all, even after Fury outpointed him in February 2023.\n\nHe has since bounced back with a decision win over another UFC legend Nate Diaz and first-round knockouts of Andre August and Ryan Bourland. An intriguing, if controversial, fight against Mike Tyson was lined up for this weekend before the former boxing heavyweight champion of the world was forced to postpone until November due to a health scare - meaning professional MMA fighter/bare-knuckle boxer Mike Perry has stepped up instead.\n\nWhen I start our interview - conducted a week before the Fury fight - by asking what the biggest misconception about Jake Paul is, he takes a moment to think, before laughing: \"I think people... they don't think I'm a real person. And I think they judge me from my past a lot, versus looking at who I am today. I think, as humans, we naturally do that, so I get it. But yeah, I think that's it...\n\n\"And they compare me to my brother,\" he quickly adds, referring to Logan, 29, who has followed a similar path to his younger sibling. \"Whenever he does something wrong, I get in trouble for it. I would probably say that's the biggest thing.\"\n\nPaul has an almost unrivalled proclivity for, simply put, winding people up. It is one of the clearest explanations for how the American has secured bouts with some of the highest-profile names in combat sports en route to going 9-1, and it is how he secured his fight with Fury - half-brother of world heavyweight boxing champion Tyson - and then a clash with UFC icon Diaz.\n\nPaul, a lot of the time, is a troll, and some people genuinely detest him for it. When friends first heard that I had interviewed him, their reactions eclipsed any interest they had in the fact that I met Anthony Joshua for the first time on the same day. Love him or hate him - and you'd probably say you hate him - people care about Jake Paul.\n\n\"I think the smart people in the world see that I'm able to play chess in the entertainment industry and make really smart moves,\" the Ohio native explains. \"Then there's the sheep who are like, 'Argh, that kid! I saw he said this! Blah, blah, blah.' Like, I did that on purpose, to get you riled up. It's marketing at the end of the day.\"\n\nIt can be argued that the side of Paul that some find irritating is just a facade, and fairly obviously so. Why, then, are people so irked by what he says?\n\n\"I think because it's true,\" he suggests, a slight smirk splitting his lips. So when Paul says something mean about you, he believes it - even if he doesn't mean it. Like the incisive, inebriated insults that you withdraw when the alcohol has washed away.\n\n\"The deepest insults are the ones that you believe to be true within your own mind,\" Paul continues. \"Those are your insecurities. If I'm attacking these people's insecurities, they're gonna get all riled up, p****d off, bent out of shape.\"\n\nPaul, for his part, does not seem to take anything that anyone says about him remotely personally. \"When they say anything about me, I've dealt with all my insecurities as a man. I've looked myself in the mirror and gone through so many spiritual, healing journeys. You don't just all of a sudden not have insecurities, but I've dealt with mine. So, if someone brings them up, it's like... I don't care, because I love myself.\"\n\nHe hasn't always loved himself, though. When asked what motivates a young man who has already reaped such riches, like a reported $38m net worth, to spend so much of his time getting punched in the face, he starts, \"It's funny...\" before following up with reasoning that is anything but that. Still, he smiles as he says it: \"I need boxing. Boxing saved me. I was in a super dark place in my life.\n\n\"I lacked discipline, lacked routine, lacked community, lacked passion, lacked progress. Boxing gave me all of those things, and I loved punching people and getting punched! I love the pace of it, the strategy, everything behind it. It's an art. Then there's the build-up, the content, the press conferences, the outfits. All of it made me fall in love with boxing, to a point where I need boxing on a daily basis just to function. I love the sport, that's really what it is.\"\n\nAnd that's the thing: For all the criticism Paul used to get for not having fought a 'real boxer', he has always taken this endeavour seriously.\n\n\"It's the most intense thing you can imagine in your mind,\" the 27-year-old says of his training. \"I'm going to my limit every single day. It's a team of eight people, fully dedicated to making this operation work - from strength and conditioning coaches to stretch therapists to three boxing coaches who are watching my every single move. It's strategy, it's gameplan, it's film review, it's repetition - pounding it over and over again. I'm studying my opponent and training like a professional athlete, with state-of-the-art facilities. It's as serious as it gets, because my life's on the line, so I'm not gonna take that lightly. And I don't want to lose, and I have all the resources available to have the best team and things around me.\"\n\nBefore the fact, Paul's match-up with Fury in February 2023 felt like an endgame for the American; win or lose, he would have been able to dismiss jibes that he had not fought a professional boxer. But it was not the endgame that many had predicted; just six months on, Paul dropped and outpointed 38-year-old Diaz - an MMA fan favourite who achieved crossover fame by submitting Conor McGregor in 2016, and who left the UFC in September 2022. August and Bourland were then dispatched before Tyson was lined up, although that will ahve to wait until November. At this point, it is unclear what Paul's endgame will be.\n\nNevertheless, \"I think I'll always box, for sure,\" Paul insists. \"And I hope to be a boxing coach one day. I'm obviously already a promoter; I think I'll promote fights for the rest of my life,\" he says, referencing his significant work with champion Amanda Serrano, for whom he secured the first seven-figure payday in women's boxing history.\n\n\"This sport is now a part of my DNA forever,\" he concludes.\n\nTalking to Paul, rather than about him, you see glimpses of the \"real person\" that others don't believe exists. Yet it is largely down to Paul that people don't see the man behind the mocking.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Rob Manfred Net Worth: How much does Rob Manfred make a year as MLB comissioner?\n\nMike Perry, the mixed martial artist, has garnered a net worth of $1 million through his career, primarily competing as a welterweight in the UFC. Born in Flint, Michigan, in September 1991, Perry began his MMA journey in 2014, initially fighting as a lightweight before transitioning to the welterweight division. He made an impressive MMA debut with a win over Hector Tirado in September 2014, and by August 2016, he was making waves in the UFC with a victory over Hyun Gyu Lim.\n\nPerry's UFC career is marked by several standout performances. He earned the Performance of the Night awards for his wins over Jake Ellenberger in April 2017 and Alex Reyes in September 2017. Additionally, his bouts against Alex Oliveira in April 2019 and Vicente Luque in August 2019 were recognized as Fight of the Night. However, Perry also faced setbacks, including a loss to Tim Means in a catchweight bout in November 2020, bringing his record to 14-7.\n\nPerry's foray into the fighting world started young; he began training in boxing at just 11 years old. Despite encountering legal troubles and spending time in prison as a teenager, Perry turned his life around. He found work as a trainer at a local UFC gym, marking the beginning of his mixed martial arts career. His amateur fighting record was a respectable 8-3, paving the way for his professional endeavors.\n\nThroughout his UFC tenure, Perry fought and defeated notable fighters such as Alex Oliveira, Jake Ellenberger, and Paul Felder. His dedication and skill in the octagon earned him approximately $1.3 million from 15 UFC fights, averaging nearly $87,000 per fight. Perry's first-round knockout against Alex Reyes at UFC Fight Night 116 and his victory over Oliveira also brought in significant bonuses, with UFC President Dana White announcing an additional $50,000 for the latter.\n\nWhat's his salary with BKF?\n\nHowever, after his victory over Oliveira in April 2019, Perry experienced a series of losses, winning only one out of his next five fights. This challenging period led him to explore new opportunities, ultimately signing with the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship (BKFC) in 2021.\n\nPerry's transition to bare-knuckle boxing proved lucrative; he reportedly earned $8 million contract with the BKFC.

But in his fight against former heavyweight champion Tyson Fury's younger brother, Tommy Fury, he lost, and has since posted some victories over underwhelming pros.\n\nSince Saudi Arabia's Turki Alalshikh and American promoters have moved so forcefully to make the major showdowns that previously seemed so difficult, the question looms about where this leaves Paul.\n\nIn the past year, boxing has given fans the undisputed welterweight title fight between Errol Spence Jr. and Terence Crawford, the undisputed heavyweight title fight between Fury and Oleksandr Usyk, and will stage the undisputed light heavyweight title fight between champions Dmitry Bivol and Artur Beterbiev, with Crawford headlining a stacked card in Los Angeles on Aug. 3.\n\nOn Thursday's episode of Pro Box TV's \"Deep Waters,\" analysts Chris Algieri and Paulie Malignaggi discussed how these boxing strides affect Paul.\n\n\"Jake is very smart - he created his own lane, signed fighters, created MVP Promotions. To me, Jake Paul is [this era's] 'Butterbean,'\" Algieri said of the former \"King of the Four-Rounders,\" a rotund heavyweight slugger whose novelty fights often landed on Top Rank pay-per-view cards a generation ago.\n\nAlgieri noted how Paul's rise, which included UFC fighters who specialized in wrestling, was \"carefully orchestrated.\n\n\"Jake is a good athlete who can punch and Jake's [improved] for real,\" Algieri said.\n\nStill, his fights are more novelty act than legitimate.\n\n\"It's still something positive for boxing because it shows when there's a fight, people want to watch it,\" Malignaggi said. \"When you were in school - junior high, high school - and there was a fistfight between two popular guys,\" students wanted to see it.\n\n\"This is what the YouTuber thing became. I'm not sure they know how to fight, but guys you know are fighting while guys who know how to fight aren't as popular as the popular guys. That's life. If popular guys get in a fight, people want to see it. It's high school all over again.\"\n\nMalignaggi admits the shelf life of the shtick seems to be nearing an expiration date.\n\n\"In some ways, you think, 'It had it's time ...'\" he said.\n\nThe analysts said Paul deserves serious props for supporting women's boxing, with titleholder Amanda Serrano on Saturday's card and heading to a rematch with undisputed champion Katie Taylor on the November card. Malignaggi calls lightweight prospect Ashton Sylve's Saturday bout against Lucas Bahdi as the best fight on the slate.\n\n\"That's how you make new fans of the sport,\" Malignaggi said.\n\nYet Algieri said he doesn't believe the Paul-Tyson fight will happen, due to Tyson's health issues, and he's not sold on the merits of cruiserweight Paul meeting the far lighter Perry on Saturday.\n\n\"This is boxing - bigger gloves, bigger guy,\" Algieri said.\n\nPaul once dreamed of fighting Saul \"Canelo\" Alvarez, but the 34-year-old undisputed super middleweight champion is in the process of making a fight, followed perhaps by showdowns with Crawford and a nine-figure meeting against unbeaten David Benavidez.", "source": {"uri": "boxingscene.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BoxingScene.com"},

Nwoko, in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on Sunday in Abuja, described the development as a breach of the social contract between the government and its citizens. He emphasised the need for job security and adherence to due process and therefore called on the CBN to immediately reinstate the affected employees. He said this was pending a comprehensive and transparent review of the circumstances surrounding their termination, involving consultations with relevant stakeholders, including labour unions and employee representatives. The lawmaker also called on the Senate to mandate its committees on Employment, Labour and Productivity, as well as that of Public Service Matters to investigate the mass terminations. He urged, \u2018'The committees should focus on the rationale behind these decisions, their compliance with labor laws, and their broader socio-economic impact, and propose measures to prevent such occurrences in the future.\u201d According to him, between March 15 and April 11, 2024, the CBN had terminated the employment of approximately 117 staff members, causing significant concern and distress among the affected employees and the general public. \u201cAlso on May 24, the CBN sacked an additional 200 staff members, bringing the total number of terminated employees to more than 317 within a short span. \u201cThese terminations affected directors, deputy directors, assistant directors, principal managers, senior managers, and lower-ranking staff. \u201cThe termination letters issued to the affected staff, including one dated May 24, from the Human Resources Department, cited the need to reorganise the organisation for effective operations as the reason for the sack. \u201cHowever, the letters lacked proper authorisation, being unsigned, and failed to provide a detailed and transparent justification for the mass terminations,\u201d Nwoko said.", "summary": "<img width=\"1284\" height=\"1589\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Image_20240526_164128_317.jpeg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Image_20240526_164128_317.jpeg 1284w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Image_20240526_164128_317-242x300.jpeg 242w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Image_20240526_164128_317-827x1024.jpeg 827w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Image_20240526_164128_317-1241x1536.jpeg 1241w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1284px) 100vw, 1284px\" /><p>The Senator representing Delta North Senatorial District, Ned Nwoko, has slammed the recent mass termination of the employment of more than 317 employees of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN.

I shouldn't have.\"\n\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhite House spokesperson Andrew Bates pointed Fox News Digital to comments made at Tuesday's press briefing by White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who told Fox News' Peter Doocy that the president is committed to serving a full second term in office. The Biden campaign did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\n\nBiden would be 86 at the conclusion of a second term if he's re-elected.\n\nABC's swift clampdown on the Stephanopoulos bombshell did not occur in a vacuum. The Disney-owned network has already landed the second presidential debate scheduled between Biden and former President Trump on Sept. 10.\n\nThe debate will be moderated by ABC's David Muir and Linsey Davis, although it's anyone's guess if it will proceed as planned. Biden's halting, frail showing last month could cause handlers to keep him out of the spotlight as much as possible, while Trump, currently enjoying a polling lead, may not want to risk giving Biden momentum.\n\nCRITICS PILE ON BIDEN FOLLOWING ABC INTERVIEW, BLAST HIS REFUSAL TO COMMIT TO COGNITIVE TEST: 'DISQUALIFYING'\n\nABC is hoping that both candidates will participate in the debate, but the perception that the network's chief political anchor doesn't believe Biden can fulfill his presidential duties for another four years likely doesn't help.\n\nBiden's debate performance sparked unprecedented calls from members of the media and even a growing number of Democrats to withdraw from the 2024 race. Biden has not budged, repeatedly saying he's staying in the race and is the best choice to defeat Trump.\n\nHis interview with Stephanopoulos was widely seen as a test to show he has the mental capacity to continue his re-election bid. However, the 22-minute sit-down has not eased tensions within his party.\n\nABC NEWS PANEL SAYS BIDEN INTERVIEW WON'T 'CALM THE NERVES' OF 'JITTERY DEMOCRATS'\n\nBiden raised eyebrows when he expressed uncertainty about whether he had watched the CNN debate, telling Stephanpoulos \"I don't think so, no.\"\n\nHe refused to commit to a cognitive test, repeatedly insisting he is tested every day in the role as the commander in chief.\n\nBiden also irked Democrats when he said he would be content with a hypothetical defeat against Trump as long as he as he \"gave it [his] all.\"\n\nOriginal article source: ABC distances itself from Stephanopoulos' claim Biden can't serve second term: 'Not the position' of network", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Doocy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Doocy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Muir", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Muir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oLLluTW98Wb9XsZgIqF9Rg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fox_news_text_979/1df65b5df060e6d1d28767b3a2369fb1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721391", "eventUri": "eng-9721391", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-10", "textStart": 1541, "textEnd": 1549}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

The interview was widely seen as a make-or-break moment for Biden following his lousy debate performance, but it did little to stem concerns about the president's age and fitness for office.\n\nStephanopoulos later confirmed the encounter. \"Earlier today I responded to a passerby.

He worked for President Bill Clinton's administration in a variety of roles, including as Clinton's senior advisor, White House Communications Director, and the 1992 campaign's communications director. Whether co-hosting GMA or promoting his recent book The Situation Room, he has a lot to say. But why is George Stephanopoulos in the news right now, and what should we know?\n\nIt's definitely an understatement to say that everyone is nervous about the November 2024 election after Joe Biden and Donald Trump's June 27th, 2024 debate (and we didn't need any more reasons to panic). Many celebrities think Biden should step down so another Democratic candidate can run... and George Stephanopoulos shared his opinion on the terrifying/frustrating/anxiety-inducing subject. But he didn't share this opinion in a TV interview or any official capacity, which makes it even more memorable to hear about.\n\nOn July 9th, 2024, according to TMZ, the news anchor was walking in New York City when someone asked him, \"Do you think Biden should step down? You've talked to him more than anybody else has lately\" and Stephanopoulos said, \"I don't think he can serve 4 more years.\"\n\nWhile this is something that a lot of people are thinking now, it was still surprising to hear a news anchor make this kind of statement, since reporters historically haven't been encouraged to make their political affiliations known. If we go to journalism school or get training as a reporter, we might hear that we shouldn't put any signs for candidates on our front lawns or post about who we're voting for on social media.\n\nBut this is actually a topic of debate (and rightly so, because it's an important one to have). A 2013 piece in The Guardian suggests that journalists need to discuss their voting choices, and several reporters told Teen Vogue in 2020 that being \"neutral\" isn't possible. The reporter interviewed for Teen Vogue also made the fair point that with so much on the line now, it's hard to imagine not saying something when it's really necessary. Of course, since we know Stephanopoulos worked for Clinton, we're not totally surprised he has this opinion. And if we've watched CNN or Fox in the past decade or so, we can argue that a lot of broadcast journalists don't hide how they really feel and it's often super obvious.\n\nAccording to Variety, George Stephanopoulos thinks he shouldn't have commented on Biden. ABC's official statement reads, \"George expressed his own point of view and not the position of ABC News.\"\n\nWhether or not we think that Stephanopoulos was in the wrong or completely right to say what he did, he explained, \"Earlier today I responded to a question from a passerby. I shouldn't have.\"\n\nGeorge Stephanopoulos's comments about President Biden are even more memorable and significant when we think about the fact that he just interviewed Biden. In the ABC News interview that aired on July 5th, 2024, Stephanopoulos dove deep into what everyone has been thinking: can Biden really run again and can he handle a second term?\n\nIn regards to his debate performance, Biden explained again that he had \"a really bad cold\" and said, \"It was a bad episode. No indication of any serious condition. I was exhausted.\" He also said that he could have \"prepared more\" but didn't.\n\nWhile Stephanopoulos asked Biden several times if he is in good enough health to continue as the President, Biden mentioned his accomplishments from the past four years. He also shared his goals for his next term if elected, explaining he will \"make sure we're in a situation where we have healthcare for all people.\"\n\nWhile Biden also said \"I'm optimistic about this country,\" there were a lot of tense moments. The most awkward might be when Stephanopoulos said \"I've never seen a President 36% approval get reelected\" and Biden said \"I don't believe that's my approval rating\" because the polls say something different.\n\nThere's a joke in journalism about \"softball questions,\" and while some might say that George Stephanopoulos did a good job of making Biden answer some hard ones, not everyone was a fan of the interview. The journalist's Instagram post about the interview has more than a few comments saying it was \"disrespectful\" to ask Biden these questions. One comment reads \"why aren't you pressing Trump on mental acuity and fitness?!\"\n\nWhether we watch the interview or just read the transcript, we're not the only ones who are wondering how this incredibly complicated situation is going to play out.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aya_tsintziras@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Aya Tsintziras", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "1992 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Situation_Room_with_Wolf_Blitzer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Vogue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teen Vogue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/george-stephanopoulos.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721391", "eventUri": "eng-9721391", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Stephanopoulos in March asked Rep. Nance Mace, R- S.C., to justify her support of former President Donald Trump after a jury found him \"liable\" for rape. The Trump campaign responded by suing ABC News and Stephanopoulos over the claim.\n\nStephanopoulos's remarks coincide with growing concern within Democratic circles surrounding Biden's mental capabilities.

He was the person granted the first post-debate interview with Biden, where the President performed a bit better than he did during the debate, but really not all that much. So what did Stephanopoulos personally think of the President's cognitive abilities and whether or not he should still be running for a second term? Apparently he wasn't impressed. He was caught on camera while walking in Manhattan this week when a random pedestrian asked him whether or not Biden should step down. He responded by saying that he doesn't think that Biden can serve four more years. We should note up front that he did not say this in his official capacity as an ABC News anchor. (NY Post)\n\nABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos admitted Tuesday that he does not believe President Biden can serve out a second term -- days after conducting a closely watched interview with the commander-in-chief following his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump last month.\n\nStephanopoulos, 63, was recorded by TMZ answering a question from a passer-by about Biden's political future in midtown Manhattan.\n\n\"Do you think Biden should step down?\" the anonymous interrogator asked the \"Good Morning America\" co-host and \"This Week\" moderator. \"You've talked to him more than anybody else has lately.\"\n\n\"I don't think he can serve four more years,\" the soft-spoken Stephanopoulos responded after a pause.\n\nStephanopoulos almost immediately regretted answering the question, which is understandable. He said, \"Earlier today I responded to a question from a passerby. I shouldn't have.\" ABC News initially didn't have any comment on the exchange, but later came out to state that the anchor had \"expressed his own point of view\" and that it did not reflect the position of ABC.\n\nIt would be easy enough to say that George Stephanopoulos simply screwed up by expressing such an opinion in public. After all, his professional occupation requires him to at least attempt to maintain the appearance of objectivity and a lack of bias. Also, he is a well-known television personality and he should clearly be aware that no matter where you go in public these days, somebody is going to be filming whatever is going on with their cell phones. Perhaps he was just distracted in the moment.\n\nBut at the same time, he's a thinking, breathing human being. He clearly must have opinions of his own. His previous history as an apparatchik of the Clintons suggests that he leans heavily toward the Democrats and liberals, most likely including Joe Biden. He had the chance to sit down for nearly half an hour with the President and question him directly while observing the responses he received. How would he not come away with the impression that Joe Biden is a cognitive mess who will be lucky to make it through the next four months, to say nothing of four more years beyond that? That's the impression being held by most people, including those in Biden's own party.\n\nI tuned in to ABC News for a little while this morning to see how they are handling the situation. They don't seem to be talking about it very much. There almost seems to be a sense of resignation in the air. Most of their on-air staff would no doubt likely be cheering for Joe Biden, but he's still not capable of generating much enthusiasm among the normally loyal press pool. It appears increasingly likely that Biden will simply refuse to step aside and release his delegates. And if that's the case, the left is probably stuck with him for better or worse. And \"worse\" is looking more and more likely based on Donald Trump's most recent poll numbers. Here's to hoping those numbers hold all the way through to November.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jazz_shaw@hotair.com", "name": "Jazz Shaw", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Week_(American_TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "This Week (American TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midtown_Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midtown Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Midtown Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Modern liberalism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2020/38/e6a0dca1-143a-492a-b08f-371d29181494.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721391", "eventUri": "eng-9721391", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

But on Tuesday, Stephanopoulos voiced his doubts about Biden's capacity to remain in office for another four years.\n\nAs shared by TMZ, Stephanopoulos was on the sidewalk, engrossed in his phone, at the beginning of the short video. A passerby then approached him and asked, \"What do you think? Do you think Biden should step down? You've talked to him more than anybody else has lately.\" The Good Morning America host from ABC allegedly had no idea he was being videotaped when he replied, \"I don't think [Biden] can serve four more years.\" Then the passerby inquired, \"You don't think he can serve four more years? Alright. That's an answer.\"\n\nCritics on X seemed to agree with Stephanopoulos's remark after seeing the clip. One user wrote, \"It's questionable if he can do 4 more months much less 4 more years. He is going downhill fast.\" Another critic shared the sentiment, \"They're finally saying what we've known for years. Surprised that Stephanopoulos did a fair interview. George is trying to save his professional career, too.\" One individual commented on Biden's mental capacity and jotted down, \"The thing about dementia is that it only gets worse and he is deteriorating rapidly. If he had a loving wife she would protect what is left of his dignity, but she only cares about two things, power and wearing the window treatments.\"\n\nStephanopoulos made the remark shortly after a heated interview with Biden, in which he questioned the president about rumors of a cognitive decline and demands from inside the Democratic Party that he step out from the race. As reported by CNN, during the interview, Stephanopoulos asked Biden, \"Do you really believe that you're not behind right now?\" For five consecutive questions, Stephanopoulos probed Biden on whether he had and would consent to a neurological and cognitive exam. Stephanopoulos eventually showed the president the harsh truth. He said, \"Mr. President, I've never seen a president (at) 36% approval get reelected.\"\n\nBiden has not made such a lengthy unscripted public appearance since his shaky performance in the debate before this interview. He maintained an aggressive stance the whole time, claiming that his previous results should speak for itself on his future abilities. He put it down to fatigue and the fact that he was so ill in the days leading up to the debate that his physicians had to check him for COVID-19.\n\nHowever, Biden flat-out refused to undergo any kind of neurological testing. He clearly stated, \"Look, I have a cognitive test every single day. Every day, I have that test.\" Nevertheless, Biden established an extremely high standard for the conditions under which he would resign. He said, \"If the Lord Almighty comes down and tells me that, I might do that.\" Biden consistently ignored the polls that Stephanopoulos used to demonstrate his inadequacy. \"That's not what our polls show,\" Biden said angrily.", "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Inquisitr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_(government_title)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President (government title)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fatigue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/704380/uploads/482f5510-3ebc-11ef-892a-f3c08ee66615_1200_630.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721391", "eventUri": "eng-9721391", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

As CNN reports, \"Democrats, including those inside the administration, view this week as critical to Biden's political survival, and lawmakers on Capitol Hill gathered privately for their weekly meetings on Tuesday.\"\n\n\"The stakes could not be higher,\" said Bennett, who says his voters have \"deep concerns\" over whether Biden can win.\n\nPunchbowl News had a sobering take on the state of affairs for Democrats in their Wednesday AM newsletter, saying Biden has \"made a mess of the Democratic party.\"\n\nSenate Democrats were far from united about whether Biden is the best person to defeat Trump. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) told us that Biden needs to \"continue to aggressively make his case\" to his fellow Democratic senators in order to \"earn full support.\"\n\nNew Jersey Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill issued a statement Tuesday afternoon calling on Biden to step aside in favor of another Democratic candidate.\n\nFellow New Jersey Democratic Rep. Andy Kim -- who's running for Senate -- walked right up the line of whether Biden should get out.\n\n\"What steps can we actually take right now [to replace Biden.] That's where some of the confusion is. Especially with all the talk of what are the actual deadlines. It's hard to kind of make a decision without fully understanding that. We need to get a better grasp on it,\" said Kim.\n\nMeanwhile, House Democratic leaders met privately on Tuesday morning with some of their most vulnerable members, for a conversation that was \"honest, brutal and intense,\" and left some members crying, according to sources with knowledge of the meeting.\n\nABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos, meanwhile, told TMZ that he doesn't think Biden can serve another four years.\n\nThe 63-year-old Stephanopoulos sat down for a closely-watched interview with Biden last week following the president's disastrous debate performance last month against Donald Trump.\n\n\"Do you think Biden should step down?\" the TMZ journalist asked the \"Good Morning America\" co-host and moderator of \"This Week.\"\n\n\"I don't think he can serve four more years,\" replied Stephanopoulos after a pause.\n\nStephanopoulos walked back his comment hours later, telling Puck News \"Earlier today I responded to a question from a passerby. I shouldn't have.\"\n\nABC News told the outlet: \"George expressed his own point of view and not the position of ABC News.\"\n\nDuring the interview between Stephanopoulos and Biden, the president failed to tamp down concerns over his cognitive fitness to continue as president - claiming that he was \"exhausted\" and \"sick\" with a \"bad cold\" heading into the June 27 debate against Trump in Atlanta.\n\nAt another point in the interview, Biden rejected calls to exit the race, saying \"If the Lord Almighty came down and said, 'Joe, get out of the race', I'd get out of the race, but the Lord Almighty's not coming down.\"", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coattail_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coattail effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Kim_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Kim (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikie_Sherrill", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikie Sherrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Blumenthal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Blumenthal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Master of Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puck_(media_company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puck (media company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Week_(American_TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "This Week (American TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-07/bennet%201a.JPG?itok=6itgF5xT", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721391", "eventUri": "eng-9721391", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 3468, "textEnd": 3475}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Biden's halting, frail showing last month could cause handlers to keep him out of the spotlight as much as possible, while Trump, currently enjoying a polling lead, may not want to risk giving Biden momentum.\n\nABC is hoping that both candidates will participate in the debate, but the perception that the network's chief political anchor doesn't believe Biden can fulfill his presidential duties for another four years likely doesn't help.\n\nBiden's debate performance sparked unprecedented calls from members of the media and even a growing number of Democrats to withdraw from the 2024 race.

'The wheels are falling off' doesn't even come close to describing it. Not only have the wheels come off, but the brake lines have been cut, the radiator is spewing out white smoke, the timing belt is busted, the engine has seized, and the entire engine block is about to fall out of the rusted chassis.\n\nThe only person who doesn't seem to realize that the car has been totaled is Joe Biden.\n\nYesterday provided another blow to voter confidence in the lemon that the Democrats have put up for sale in their yard. Career Democrat operative (now disguised as a 'journalist') George Stephanopoulos was caught in an unscripted moment on the streets of New York by a pedestrian with a camera, where he said what everyone else already knows. Watch:\n\n'I don't think he can serve four more years.' As the pedestrian noted in the video ... that's an answer alright.\n\nAs TMZ reports, this comment from Stephanopoulos is even more damning, not just because of his left bias, but because he just sat down to talk to Biden last week.\n\nGeorge's comment is telling, given he had an exclusive sit-down with the Prez just 4 days ago. George pressed Biden on his mental acuity and his dismal debate performance. Outside the White House bubble, George has spent more one-on-one time with the President than just about anyone.\n\nThe left was BIG mad that Stephanopoulos let the truth slip out.\n\nLOL. 'Independent.' Yeah, that describes Stephanopoulos' career at ABC News alright. He just calls balls and strikes.\n\nThey've got nothing to campaign on, so they're just going to repeat 'Project 2025' as often as they can.\n\nHowever, word must have gotten back to Stephanopoulos that he committed a big 'no-no' here in a candid moment. After TMZ published the video, he and ABC News sent statements to TMZ to apologize.\n\nThe tweet continues, 'In a separate statement, an ABC News spokesperson tells me, 'George expressed his own point of view and not the position of ABC News.''\n\nBINGO. (Except Stephanopoulos probably won't lose his job.)\n\nThat's an interesting question about how ABC phrased its statement. What is ABC's position, since they felt the need to state that Stephanopoulos' words did not reflect that?\n\nThey won't answer that question, but they don't really have to. Everyone knows what ABC's position is.\n\nLater, Brian Stelter (who is kind of confusing us lately) went on CNN to talk about the comment and the apology.\n\nSure, Potato. Stephanopoulos is 'an outsider' and you were all 'duped.'\n\nGive us a break.\n\nStelter almost told the truth during his appearance though. Stephanopoulos' opinion does matter. Not to normal people or voters, but to Democrat insiders and influencers, it does.\n\nAnd that's why he had to apologize. They haven't given him permission to completely throw Biden under the bus yet.\n\nPardon our corny phrasing, but who, exactly, does the media think they are fooling here?\n\nThis is 100 percent accurate. If Stephanopoulos had been stopped on the street and said, 'I think Joe Biden showed great acumen during our interview and I believe he is up for the job,' he would have never apologized. And ABC never would have issued a statement distancing themselves from his comments.\n\nIt wasn't bad for him to have an opinion.

How much money does the ABC News anchor have? - Revista Merca2.0 |", "body": "George Stephanopoulos has been a prominent figure in both politics and journalism\n\nThe ABC News anchor, George Stephanopoulos, found himself at the center of a media whirlwind following his off-the-cuff remarks about President Joe Biden's capability to serve another term.\n\nThese comments were made to a stranger and recorded without Stephanopoulos's knowledge, surfacing on the gossip site TMZ. The incident has sparked a debate about the responsibilities and personal views of news anchors.\n\nWhile walking in Midtown Manhattan, Stephanopoulos, dressed in workout attire, was approached by an unidentified individual who recorded their interaction. During this exchange, Stephanopoulos was asked whether he believed President Biden should step down, to which he responded, \"I don't think he can serve four more years.\" This statement was particularly poignant coming just days after Stephanopoulos had conducted a major interview with Biden following a debate performance that raised questions about the president's vigor.\n\nRecognizing the potential implications of his statement, Stephanopoulos quickly issued an apology, stressing that his remark was a spontaneous response to a passerby's question and not meant as a public assertion. ABC News also distanced itself from the comment, emphasizing that it reflected Stephanopoulos's personal view rather than the network's position.\n\nGeorge Stephanopoulos has been a prominent figure in both politics and journalism. His career trajectory took him from the White House, where he served as the Communications Director under President Bill Clinton, to the upper echelons of ABC News. As a co-host of \"Good Morning America\" and the anchor of \"The Lead,\" Stephanopoulos has become one of the most recognizable faces in American news. His annual salary of $15 million underscores his value to the network.\n\nBorn on February 10th, 1961, in Fall River, Massachusetts, Stephanopoulos was raised in a Greek Orthodox family and showed early promise in academics and athletics. After excelling in high school, he pursued higher education at Columbia University, followed by a Master of Arts in Theology from Oxford. His political career began earnestly with his role in Michael Dukakis's 1988 presidential campaign, setting the stage for his later involvement with the Clintons.\n\nAfter a grueling stint in politics, Stephanopoulos shifted to journalism. He initially struggled to find his footing in the competitive environment of network news but eventually secured his position by landing high-profile interviews and moderating presidential debates.\n\nGeorge Stephanopoulos has a net worth of approximately $40 million. He earns a salary of $15 million per year for his roles as a co-host of \"Good Morning America\" and the host of \"The Lead\" on ABC News. His wealth and career success stem from his transition from politics, where he was once the White House Press Secretary under President Bill Clinton, to a prominent position in journalism.", "source": {"uri": "merca20.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Merca2.0 Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laura_islas@merca20.com", "name": "Laura Islas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midtown_Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midtown Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Midtown Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1984 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Orthodox_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greek Orthodox Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Master of Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Higher education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_River,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fall River, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fall River, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://files.merca20.com/uploads/2024/07/George-Stephanopoulos-JOE-BIDEN.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721391", "eventUri": "eng-9721391", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The visibly aging Democratic Party standard-bearer was incoherent from the outset, though he improved slightly, to mostly incoherent by the end. There was such an uproar that the president, swatting off gadflies in his own party, decided to do something he rarely does: a sit-down interview with the press.\n\nFor the task, Biden chose George Stephanopoulos, the Clinton White House communications director turned hard-hitting ABC News anchor. Stephanopoulos was a fine choice for the job -- a trusted voice on a major network, a seasoned pro who has interviewed politicos for decades. And he performed admirably: He grilled Biden repeatedly on his age, his ability to serve an additional term in office, and the blaring calls for him to step aside and turn over the ticket to a younger candidate. The president, for his part, came off better than he had during the debate, but seeing as he didn't suddenly revert into the spritely Mr. Smith Goes to Washington-esque character of his youth, he did little to assuage concerns from Washington's growling political class.\n\nBut Stephanopoulos' mistake wasn't evident until later. Strolling down Fifth Avenue in formfitting workout clothes and over-ear headphones, the anchor responded to a pedestrian's question: \"Do you think Biden should step down? You've talked to him more than anybody else has lately.\" He responded, simply, \"I don't think he can serve four more years.\" After the celebrity gossip site TMZ published a grainy video of the encounter, Stephanopoulos said in a statement, \"Earlier today, I responded to a question from a passerby. I shouldn't have.\" (Note that he didn't take back his words.) ABC News clarified: \"George expressed his own point of view and not the position of ABC News.\"\n\nStephanopoulos erred neither in talking to a rando on the street nor in divulging his personal opinion. His ethical misstep was in concealing his up-close-and-personal evaluation of the president from ABC's viewers.\n\nJournalists all too often bow at the altar of objectivity, a false idol that demands they divorce the part of their brain that asks questions from the part that forms opinions based on those answers. Stephanopoulos engaged in the good work of demanding accountability from the world's most powerful human being but stopped short of delivering what the populace and Democratic decisionmakers needed from him.\n\nAccording to New York magazine, the Wall Street Journal, even George Clooney, Biden's cognitive decline has been increasingly evident, a carefully guarded vulnerability at an inconvenient time: the run-up to an election against Donald Trump, arguably the foremost threat to American democracy, the man who tried to stay in power on Jan. 6, 2021, against the will of the voting public. There couldn't be a worse moment for Biden to lose a step -- let alone two, or three, or 100.\n\nStephanopoulos had the rare opportunity to interview the president. He should have been upfront about what he saw, how he felt, and what he believed. Those opinions colored the premise of the interview and his questioning. There's no reason he couldn't be honest with viewers and say how he felt. If he can say it to someone on the street, he should say it to everyone.", "source": {"uri": "slate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slate Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_nover@slate.com", "name": "Scott Nover", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Bill_Clinton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Avenue", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fifth Avenue"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://compote.slate.com/images/6641675d-7761-4b6c-9977-2f2eb173c563.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721391", "eventUri": "eng-9721391", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

He immediately regretted these comments. During the interview conducted by him, Biden dismissed concerns pertaining to his 'cognitive health' as well as demands calling for his replacement on the ballot box. ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos was embarrassed after a video went viral in which he could be seen saying that US President Joe Biden is not fit to serve a second term in office. The news anchor had a few days back conducted an interview with the president which had been well received and became a discussion point among many. He immediately regretted his frank exchange of views with a stranger after the video went viral. The news channel too has distanced itself from these comments. Further, Biden's interview covered a wide range of topics including his disastrous performance in the first presidential debate as well as demands by various Democrats to replace him on the ballot box.\n\nIn a video obtained by TMZ, Stephanopoulos is seen answering a question from a passerby in Manhattan who asked if Biden can continue in office for a second term. The passerby asked him specifically if Biden should step down. After carefully considering the question, the co-host of \"Good Morning America\" said that Biden cannot continue for another four years.\n\nAlso Read: Who was William Stampfl? How his body was found on Mount Huascaran 20 years after he went missing in avalanche?\n\nAfter the video went viral, Stephanopoulos regretted his candid views and ABC News distanced itself saying that these were the anchor's personal views.\n\nThis interview which was conducted after the first presidential debate lasted for 22 minutes and was watched by over 8.5 million Americans. The president rejected views that there is a cognitive decline and said that he was undergoing cognitive tests every-day. He added that he was suffering from a cold and was exhausted during the debate and hence did not appear to be fit.\n\nHe further claimed that his frequent errors during the debate were a bad episode rather than a permanent deterioration. He refused to undergo a cognitive test to prove his point.\n\nIn the same interview, he also added that he will contest the upcoming presidential election and will not step down. He added that he would step down only if the All Mighty asked him to do so and so far, that has not happened.\n\nOn Monday, Biden addressed a letter to the party's legislators in the US Congress and had a conference with the donors wherein he said that he will continue to remain in office.\n\nHow many members of the Democratic Party in the US House of Representatives have called on Biden to step down as the candidate in the upcoming presidential election?\n\nIt has been reported that seven members of the House have asked for Biden's replacement on the ballot.

Barack Obama took Biden by the hand to lead him off the stage and the media tried to call video of the event a \"cheap fake,\" despite the fact those were the facts. It's just they didn't like to hear it at this point.\n\nNow, however, the boot suppressing the facts seems to have been lifted. Not only that, we now have a bit of a stunning op-ed from George Clooney, saying Democrats need a new nominee, not Biden.\n\nI love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. As a tender but fierce lover.\n\nI consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced.\n\nBut the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \"big F-ing deal\" Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\n\nWas he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before. As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.\n\nI call upon my good friend Alec Baldwin to hire Joe Biden as the cinematographer for his movie\n\nDust.\n\nABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos admitted Tuesday that he does not believe President Biden can serve out a second term -- days after conducting a closely watched interview with the commander-in-chief following his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump last month.\n\nStephanopoulos, 63, was recorded in a video obtained by TMZ answering a question from a passer-by in Midtown Manhattan about Biden's political future.\n\n\"Do you think Biden should step down?\" the anonymous interrogator asked the \"Good Morning America\" co-host and \"This Week\" moderator.\n\n\"You've talked to him more than anybody else has lately.\"\n\n\"I don't think he can serve four more years,\" the soft-spoken Stephanopoulos responded after a pause.\n\n\"You don't think he can serve four more years?\" the questioner repeated before adding: \"All right, that's an answer.\"\n\nHours later after the video made headlines, Stephanopoulos expressed regret for offering his candid response.\n\n\"Earlier today I responded to a question from a passerby. I shouldn't have,\" the news anchor told Puck News in a statement.\n\nAnd ABC News, in its own statement to the outlet, added: \"George expressed his own point of view and not the position of ABC News.\"\n\nLEMIRE: So Madam Speaker, you just went through the president's record, but let me ask you about the current moment. Does he have your support to be the head of the Democratic ticket?\n\nPELOSI: As long as the president has, it's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short. The, I think overwhelming support of the caucus, it's not for me to say, I'm not the head of the caucus anymore, but he's beloved, he is respected, and people want him to make that decision, not me.\n\nLEMIRE: He has said, he has made the decision. He has said firmly this week he is going to run. Do you want him to run?\n\nPELOSI: I want him to do whatever he decides to do, and that's the way it is. Whatever he decides, we go with. I think it's really important, and I would hope everyone would join in, to let him deal with this NATO conference. This is a very big deal. 30 heads, over 30, heads of state are here. He is the host of it, and that means not just hosting, but that means orchestrating the discussion and setting the agenda, and he's doing so magnificently.\n\nAnd I've said to everyone, let's just hold off. Whatever you're thinking, either tell someone privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week.\n\nWhich is so odd -- in mid-June, CNN was still acting as a party operatives with bylines pushing the \"cheap fakes\" and \"deceptive editing\" White House talking points whenever video emerged of the (p)resident acting just as we've seen during the debate and afterward.\n\nOr as Oliver Wiseman writes at the Free Press: How 'Misinformation' Becomes Common Knowledge: \"Every White House reporter, every fancy magazine profiler, they knew exactly what was going on with Joe Biden. They just didn't think you, the reader, were ready to know. Also, did we mention the risk of getting yelled at by an intern? That's hard. The Biden era has to be one of the least covered White Houses in modern history.

It's a show me situation. So he'd have to be out and about in the hurly-burly of a campaign, open-ended press conferences with folks like you, engagements with voters that are unscripted,\" Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., told CNN on Wednesday. \"I do think that the response here would have to involve being very much in the public in an unscripted situation, as opposed to a few interviews or conversations with governors.\"\n\nBiden, who has done fewer formal interviews and press conferences than any of his recent predecessors, joined ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, a former top aide to President Bill Clinton, for an interview on Friday. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Tuesday that Biden also plans to hold a press conference during the upcoming NATO summit.\n\n\"An interview at this point would just be a Band-Aid on a giant, gaping bullet hole. This body President Biden is bleeding out, and a single interview is not going to change that. The news in the last couple of hours is just even more damning for him,\" former CNN media reporter Brian Stelter said during an interview on the network on Tuesday, prior to the news that Biden would sit down with ABC.\n\nBIDEN PANNED FOR NOT BEING CERTAIN ABOUT WHETHER HE WATCHED THE DEBATE: 'HE DOESN'T KNOW???'\n\n\"I think instead of just an interview, think about another debate. Think about a rematch between Trump and Biden. Think about a series of press conferences. Think about a series of town halls that would be a little bit more, I think, in the realm of what might help at this point. But, an interview. It's a Band-Aid on a bullet hole,\" he said, speaking to CNN's Brianna Keilar.\n\nKeilar questioned whether Biden needed to mirror something like a debate, without a teleprompter \"for an extended period of time.\"\n\n\"And this raises a question about whether he can, in other words, if he could do that, he would do that by now,\" Stelter responded. \"If he could hold a primetime news conference, he probably would.\"\n\nAfter the ABC interview aired on Friday, ABC correspondent Jon Karl said it did nothing to quell the fears of \"jittery Democrats who fear that Joe Biden is on a trajectory to lose this race.\"\n\n\"In fact, for some of those people, the interview is raising new concerns, particularly the fact that he is unwilling or unaware of the fact that he is in a dire situation here regarding the campaign, that he is losing, in the view of many Democrats and frankly in the polls you cited, that he is losing to Donald Trump,\" he said.\n\nBIDEN TAKES BLAME FOR 'BAD NIGHT' IN DEBATE AGAINST TRUMP: 'MY FAULT, NO ONE ELSE'S FAULT'\n\nFormer Obama adviser David Axelrod also said the ABC interview did little to quell Democratic panic.\n\n\"Only 'the Lord Almighty' could persuade him to give up the race, the president said, as a growing chorus of Democrats, fearful of an electoral disaster, call for him to step aside,\" Axelrod wrote. \"Denial. Delusion. Defiance.\"\n\nRepublican strategist Doug Heye said Wednesday on CNN that Biden needed to get himself back out there and answer questions from reporters. He also brought up Biden deciding not to sit for a live interview on Super Bowl Sunday. Heye said the reasoning, according to the White House, was that he didn't want to politicize the day.\n\nThe president ended up posting a video to social media that took aim at \"shrinkflation\" during the Super Bowl.\n\n\"So they did want to politicize the day,\" Heye said of the video. \"But the message that was sent was that they don't trust Biden to do a sit-down interview. It wouldn't go well for him. And I think now we know why if we didn't know that all along.\"\n\nKate Bedingfield, a former Biden White House communications director, said Wednesday on CNN that the interview with Stephanopoulos might have been taped because of \"scheduling\" issues, but explained a different issue with the strategy when a CNN host asked if she would have pushed for a live interview.\n\nBIDEN SKIPPING THE SUPER BOWL INTERVIEW PERPLEXES CNN'S TAPPER: 'WHAT'S HE AFRAID OF?'\n\n\"I think live versus taped when you're doing a significant network sit-down is not that big of a differentiation, to be honest with you,\" Bedingfield said. \"What I would have pushed for is for him to be out earlier. There has been a lag between the debate performance and when we're going to see him out again answering questions.\"\n\n\"Put the president out there in various ways in which, you know, he will shine. Again, I think town halls, doing things with voters, real people, where he is answering questions from regular folks, will make the difference. I do think the president could rise to that occasion,\" MSNBC's Symone Sanders Townsend said on Tuesday.\n\nTownsend, who worked for Vice President Harris before heading to MSNBC, said Biden was his own best political consultant.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a big supporter of the president, also called on him to do interviews with \"serious\" journalists. She said he would need to do more than one.\n\n\"My recommendation is for him to have some interviews with serious journalists, you among them, a serious journalist, no holds barred, any question's fair, and just sit there and be Joe, show your value, show your knowledge, show your judgment, show your empathy for the American people. And I think that would be a great thing for him. Not one, maybe two, a couple of those. I think that is essential. I think it is essential for them to do that,\" she said.\n\nLIBERAL NEWSPAPERS, BIDEN MEDIA ALLIES PRESSURE BIDEN TO DROP OUT OF RACE: 'HIS HUBRIS IS INFURIATING'\n\nAxios senior media reporter Sara Fischer, a CNN senior media analyst, argued on Thursday that President Biden's upcoming ABC interview won't be enough to fix his reputation with the American people.\n\n\"So one of the things that the president is trying to argue is 'Don't look at this 90-minute debate. Look at my 3.5 years,'\" Fischer said. \"Well, the challenge also works on the flipside, if you don't want us to believe what we saw, then give us multiple examples of you being able to do a live, unscripted interview, so we can see that this was just a one-off, if that's what you claim.\"\n\nMSNBC's Joe Scarborough said Friday that Biden needed to answer the question, \"is he capable of moving forward?\"\n\n\"He knows he needs to answer that question. He needs to answer it in interviews, he needs to answer it in press conferences, he needs to answer it at the NATO Summit. He needs to answer it in everything he does,\" Scarborough said.\n\nFormer Ohio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan said Wednesday that Biden's ABC interview wasn't going to help. He told CNN that, \"Nothing that's been happening is encouraging.\"\n\n\"It's got to be a lot more than that,\" Ryan said, suggesting the president do interviews and town halls in \"hostile\" environments.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe president also spoke to two radio hosts in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin for interviews that aired on Thursday. Both hosts, Andrea Lawful Sanders and Earl Ingram, revealed that they were sent questions for the interviews ahead of time by the Biden campaign.\n\nSanders said she approved four questions from the White House to ask in the interview.\n\nSeveral key Biden allies have stuck by the president following the debate, including Pelosi and Clyburn, despite several Democrats and liberal media outlets

However, there are still \"enormous concerns\" over his fitness to serve both through the end of his first term and the end of a possible second term.\n\nStephanopoulos is not the only major voice to express concern for Biden.

And this was a Wall Street Journal survey taken months before the debate. Other polls taken post-debate have similar results.\n\nFor example, a CBS survey post-debate shows just 27% of the public believes Biden has the cognitive ability to do the job.\n\nDEMS WHO HAVE CALLED FOR BIDEN TO DROP OUT OR RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT HIS HEALTH\n\nSo yeah, George, after what we saw on that debate stage on June 27 and the way he conducted himself in his interview with you, which was only 22 minutes because that's what the president's team insisted on, maybe Biden should trade in Air Force One for a golf cart.\n\nIt wasn't long ago that Stephanopolous was offended at the mere prospect of Biden's mental state being questioned. In June 2023, then-presidential candidate Nikki Haley appeared on his program to make the argument that Kamala Harris was going to be the party nominee because Biden wasn't going to finish his first term, drawing the anchor's ire.\n\n\"A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Kamala Harris,\" Haley said at the time.\n\n\"There's no way Joe Biden is going to finish his term,\" she continued. \"I think Kamala Harris is going to be the next president and that should send a chill up every American spine. But also think the fact that we have a primary...\"\n\n\"Excuse me, excuse me,\" Stephanopoulos interrupted, scowling. \"How do you know Joe Biden's not going to finish his term? What is that based on?\"\n\n\"Ask Americans,\" Haley replied. \"We look at the decline he's had over the last few years. You have to be honest with the American people, George: There's no way that Joe Biden is going to finish out a next term. We can't have an 81-year-old president.\"\n\n\"Again, you didn't answer the question,\" an agitated Stephanopoulos shot back. \"What evidence do you have that he's not going to finish the term? What Americans feel has no basis on whether he's going to finish his term or not?\"\n\nHow does that defense look now, George?\n\nThe dam cracked even more on Wednesday, with major fundraisers like celebrity heavyweight George Clooney writing in The New York Times that Biden needs to go, and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi running to MSNBC to imply the same on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe news cycle has never been the worst for any Democratic president going back to Jimmy Carter and the failed attempt to rescue American hostages held in Iran in 1980.\n\nSince the debate, we're talking about nearly two weeks of non-stop, blanket coverage talking about Biden's mental acuity (or lack thereof), or if the president can survive his own party attempting to take him out, or if he has a neurological disorder like Parkinson's.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nNothing is going right for Democrats as the panic heads to DEFCON-1. And while all of this is happening, a disciplined Donald Trump has mostly stayed above the fray, instead allowing Biden to sink in his own quicksand.\n\nAs Napoleon once said, \"Never interrupt your enemy when he is destroying himself.\"\n\nIt's funny to think about the media coverage of Biden pre-debate: The best was when we heard about how sharp the president is behind closed doors by party allies and fans in the media.\n\n\"Start your tape right now because I'm about to tell you the truth,\" Biden close friend and Morning Joe co-host Joe Scarborough said on MSNBC in March. \"And F--- you if you can't handle the truth. This version of Biden intellectually, analytically, is the best Biden ever. Not a close second. And I have known him for years. The Brzezinskis have known him for 50 years. If it weren't the truth I wouldn't say it.\"\n\nYep. Close those doors and when the public can't see him, Biden is actually doing quadratic equations. He's explaining how the flux capacitor works. Basically, he's Stephen Hawking.\n\nGeorge Stephanopolous thinks Joe Biden should not serve a second term. Another George of the Clooney variety agrees.\n\nIt's hard to see how this bell unrings itself. And until there's some kind of clear path forward for the Democratic ticket on the ballot in November, the insanity that is the Biden-led news cycle will continue to go unabated.", "source": {"uri":

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Neha ? Food blogger (@culinarychaser) Digital creator and food blogger Neha, who goes by 'Culinary Chaser' on Instagram, shared that you need only 3 simple ingredients to make this drink- chocolate, a disposable glass and any drink of your choice- be it a smoothie, latte, milkshake or even coffee. Melt your chocolate and swirl it across the walls of your glass to coat it completely with the liquid and then refrigerate for 10 minutes. Neha shared the recipe for a Mango rose latte in her reel, pureeing mango chunks and adding rose syrup and milk into the mix to make a refreshing summer-friendly concoction. \"The first time I tried making this drink, I ended up coating the glass with too thin a layer of chocolate. When I took it out, the layer broke. Getting the right thickness of the chocolate layer is important and can be achieved with a couple of tries,\" she recounted. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Mahima Dhoot (@diningwithdhoot) Mahima Dhoot, another food blogger who popularly goes by 'Dining with Dhoot', recommended using dark chocolate compound and keeping the layer just thin enough to make the cut. \"If the layer is too thick, upon cracking the pieces become too chunky for both taste and convenience,\" she pointed out. Both of them suggested environment-friendly alternatives if you do not want to use plastic cups to make the drink. They said bio-degradable glasses and paper cups work just fine, provided one found a transparent cup. The appeal of this drink lies in the visual element, where aesthetic colours swirl and mix together. \"If the cup isn't see through, half the joy would be killed,\" said Mahima.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/food-wine/cracking-drink-tiktok-viral-recipe-9378390/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/drink.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:08:35", "author": "Lifestyle Desk", "authors": ["Lifestyle Desk"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.144}

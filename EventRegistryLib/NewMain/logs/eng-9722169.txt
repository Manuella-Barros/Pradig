But his debts aren't going away", "body": "A judge says he is leaning toward throwing out Rudy Giuliani's bankruptcy case after lawyers for the cash-strapped former New York City mayor and his biggest creditors agreed this was the best way forward\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- A judge said Wednesday he was leaning toward throwing out Rudy Giuliani 's bankruptcy case after lawyers for the cash-strapped former New York City mayor and his biggest creditors -- two ex-Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation judgment against him -- agreed this was the best way forward.\n\nThe case has been roiled by allegations Giuliani is flouting bankruptcy laws and potentially hiding assets. A dismissal would end his pursuit of bankruptcy protection, but it wouldn't let him off the hook for his debts. His creditors could pursue other legal remedies to recoup at least some of the money they're owed, such as getting a court order to seize his apartments and other assets.\n\nU.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane said he plans to issue a decision by the end of the week. He scheduled a hearing for 1 p.m. Friday and could make his ruling at that time. Lane ruled out converting the case to a liquidation, as Giuliani had recently requested, saying that doing so would not be in the best interest of people and entities he's indebted to.\n\n\"I'm leaning toward dismissal frankly because I'm concerned that the past is prologue,\" Lane said during a hybrid in-person and Zoom status hearing in White Plains, New York.\n\nGiuliani's lawyer, Gary Fischoff, said dismissing the case would allow him to pursue an appeal in the defamation case, which arose from his efforts to overturn Donald Trump's 2020 election loss.\n\nA lawyer for the former election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \"Shaye\" Moss, accused Giuliani of using the bankruptcy process as a \"bad-faith litigation tactic\" and said \"he regards this court as a pause button on his woes.\"\n\nLane scolded Giuliani at one point for interrupting the hearing. The ex-mayor, joining by phone, called Freeman and Moss lawyer Rachel Strickland's comments -- including remarks about his many legal woes -- \"highly defamatory, your honor.\"\n\nPhilip Dublin, a lawyer for a committee of Giuliani's other creditors, said the committee would rather keep the bankruptcy case going with the appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee.\n\nGiuliani filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in December, days after the former election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \"Shaye\" Moss, won their defamation case. They said Giuliani's targeting of them because of Trump's lies about the 2020 election being stolen led to death threats that made them fear for their lives.\n\nEarlier this month, Giuliani requested that his Chapter 11 bankruptcy case be converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation -- which would have seen a trustee appointed to take control of his assets and sell many of them off to help pay creditors. Reconsidering that idea on Wednesday and pushing for a dismissal instead, Fischoff noted that administrative fees related to liquidation would \"consume if not 100%, a substantial portion of the assets.\"\n\nIf the bankruptcy is dismissed, Freeman and Moss could bring their effort to collect on the $148 million award back to the court in Washington, D.C., where they won their lawsuit, and avoid having to pay more legal fees for bankruptcy court. Lane said a dismissal would include a 12-month ban on Giuliani filing again for bankruptcy protection.\n\nFreeman and Moss, meanwhile, have a pending request before the judge to declare that the $148 million judgment cannot be discharged -- or dismissed -- during Giuliani's bankruptcy.\n\nThe bankruptcy is one of a host of legal woes consuming Giuliani. Last week, the former federal prosecutor was disbarred as an attorney in New York after a court found that he repeatedly made false statements about Trump's 2020 election loss. He is also facing the possibility of losing his law license in Washington after a board in May recommended that he be disbarred.\n\nIn Georgia and Arizona, Giuliani is facing criminal charges over his role in the effort to overturn the 2020 election. He has pleaded not guilty in both cases.\n\nWhen he filed for bankruptcy, Giuliani listed nearly $153 million in existing or potential debts, including almost $1 million in state and federal tax liabilities, money he owes lawyers, and many millions of dollars in potential judgments in lawsuits against him. He estimated he had assets worth $1 million to $10 million.\n\nIn his most recent financial filings in the bankruptcy case, he said he had about $94,000 cash in hand at the end of May while his company, Giuliani Communications, had about $237,000 in the bank. A main source of income for Giuliani over the past two years has been a retirement account with a balance of just over $1 million in May, down from nearly $2.5 million in 2022 after his withdrawals, the filings say.\n\nIn May, he spent nearly $33,000 including nearly $28,000 for condo and co-op costs for his Florida and New York City homes. He also spent about $850 on food, $390 on cleaning services, $230 on medicine, $200 on laundry and $190 on vehicles.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michael_r_sisak@register-herald.com", "name": "Michael R.

But his debts aren't going away", "body": "NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge said Wednesday he was leaning toward throwing out Rudy Giuliani 's bankruptcy case after lawyers for the cash-strapped former New York City mayor and his biggest creditors -- two ex-Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation judgment against him -- agreed this was the best way forward.\n\nThe case has been roiled by allegations Giuliani is flouting bankruptcy laws and potentially hiding assets. A dismissal would end his pursuit of bankruptcy protection, but it wouldn't let him off the hook for his debts. His creditors could pursue other legal remedies to recoup at least some of the money they're owed, such as getting a court order to seize his apartments and other assets.\n\nU.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane said he plans to issue a decision by the end of the week. He scheduled a hearing for 1 p.m. Friday and could make his ruling at that time. Lane ruled out converting the case to a liquidation, as Giuliani had recently requested, saying that doing so would not be in the best interest of people and entities he's indebted to.\n\n\"I'm leaning toward dismissal frankly because I'm concerned that the past is prologue,\" Lane said during a hybrid in-person and Zoom status hearing in White Plains, New York.\n\nGiuliani's lawyer, Gary Fischoff, said dismissing the case would allow him to pursue an appeal in the defamation case, which arose from his efforts to overturn Donald Trump's 2020 election loss.\n\nA lawyer for the former election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \"Shaye\" Moss, accused Giuliani of using the bankruptcy process as a \"bad-faith litigation tactic\" and said \"he regards this court as a pause button on his woes.\"\n\nLane scolded Giuliani at one point for interrupting the hearing. The ex-mayor, joining by phone, called Freeman and Moss lawyer Rachel Strickland's comments -- including remarks about his many legal woes -- \"highly defamatory, your honor.\"\n\nPhilip Dublin, a lawyer for a committee of Giuliani's other creditors, said the committee would rather keep the bankruptcy case going with the appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee.\n\nGiuliani filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in December, days after the former election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \"Shaye\" Moss, won their defamation case. They said Giuliani's targeting of them because of Trump's lies about the 2020 election being stolen led to death threats that made them fear for their lives.\n\nEarlier this month, Giuliani requested that his Chapter 11 bankruptcy case be converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation -- which would have seen a trustee appointed to take control of his assets and sell many of them off to help pay creditors. Reconsidering that idea on Wednesday and pushing for a dismissal instead, Fischoff noted that administrative fees related to liquidation would \"consume if not 100%, a substantial portion of the assets.\"\n\nIf the bankruptcy is dismissed, Freeman and Moss could bring their effort to collect on the $148 million award back to the court in Washington, D.C., where they won their lawsuit, and avoid having to pay more legal fees for bankruptcy court. Lane said a dismissal would include a 12-month ban on Giuliani filing again for bankruptcy protection.\n\nFreeman and Moss, meanwhile, have a pending request before the judge to declare that the $148 million judgment cannot be discharged -- or dismissed -- during Giuliani's bankruptcy.\n\nThe bankruptcy is one of a host of legal woes consuming Giuliani. Last week, the former federal prosecutor was disbarred as an attorney in New York after a court found that he repeatedly made false statements about Trump's 2020 election loss. He is also facing the possibility of losing his law license in Washington after a board in May recommended that he be disbarred.\n\nIn Georgia and Arizona, Giuliani is facing criminal charges over his role in the effort to overturn the 2020 election. He has pleaded not guilty in both cases.\n\nWhen he filed for bankruptcy, Giuliani listed nearly $153 million in existing or potential debts, including almost $1 million in state and federal tax liabilities, money he owes lawyers, and many millions of dollars in potential judgments in lawsuits against him. He estimated he had assets worth $1 million to $10 million.\n\nIn his most recent financial filings in the bankruptcy case, he said he had about $94,000 cash in hand at the end of May while his company, Giuliani Communications, had about $237,000 in the bank. A main source of income for Giuliani over the past two years has been a retirement account with a balance of just over $1 million in May, down from nearly $2.5 million in 2022 after his withdrawals, the filings say.\n\nIn May, he spent nearly $33,000 including nearly $28,000 for condo and co-op costs for his Florida and New York City homes. He also spent about $850 on food, $390 on cleaning services, $230 on medicine, $200 on laundry and $190 on vehicles.", "source": {"uri": "orlandosentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Orlando

One group of creditors asked Lane to appoint a trustee to take over Giuliani's finances and businesses, which could lead to a lengthy and contested bankruptcy liquidation, while another group said Giuliani should be kicked out of bankruptcy altogether.\n\nAll three options pose significant risks for Giuliani.\n\nLane said dismissal was likely the best option, given the difficulties the court has had in getting straight answers from Giuliani about his finances. A dismissal of his bankruptcy would allow Giuliani's creditors to resume lawsuits against him, but it would also give him more freedom to appeal the $148m defamation judgment that prompted him to seek the legal protection afforded by a bankruptcy filing.\n\n\"We believe that the debtor's best chance of getting an appellate determination would be dismissal,\" Giuliani attorney Gary Fischoff said during Wednesday's court hearing.\n\nRachel Strickland, representing Moss and her mother, Freeman, said Giuliani should be kicked out of bankruptcy so her clients can try to collect against him.\n\nGiuliani \"regards this court as a pause button on his woes while he continues to live his life unbothered by creditors\", Strickland told Lane.\n\nA committee representing Giuliani's other creditors asked Lane to instead appoint a trustee to take over Giuliani's finances and businesses. Committee attorney Phil Dublin said ending the bankruptcy now would create a \"race to the courthouse\" among the many people who have sued Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani's other creditors include former employee Noelle Dunphy, who has accused Giuliani of sexual assault and wage theft, and the voting machine companies Dominion and Smartmatic, who have also sued Giuliani for defamation.

But his debts aren't going away", "body": "A judge says he is leaning toward throwing out Rudy Giuliani's bankruptcy case after lawyers for the cash-strapped former New York City mayor and his biggest creditors agreed this was the best way forward\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- A judge said Wednesday he was leaning toward throwing out Rudy Giuliani 's bankruptcy case after lawyers for the cash-strapped former New York City mayor and his biggest creditors -- two ex-Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation judgment against him -- agreed this was the best way forward.\n\nThe case has been roiled by allegations Giuliani is flouting bankruptcy laws and potentially hiding assets. A dismissal would end his pursuit of bankruptcy protection, but it wouldn't let him off the hook for his debts. His creditors could pursue other legal remedies to recoup at least some of the money they're owed, such as getting a court order to seize his apartments and other assets.\n\nU.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane said he plans to issue a decision by the end of the week. He scheduled a hearing for 1 p.m. Friday and could make his ruling at that time. Lane ruled out converting the case to a liquidation, as Giuliani had recently requested, saying that doing so would not be in the best interest of people and entities he's indebted to.\n\n\"I'm leaning toward dismissal frankly because I'm concerned that the past is prologue,\" Lane said during a hybrid in-person and Zoom status hearing in White Plains, New York.\n\nGiuliani's lawyer, Gary Fischoff, said dismissing the case would allow him to pursue an appeal in the defamation case, which arose from his efforts to overturn Donald Trump's 2020 election loss.\n\nA lawyer for the former election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \"Shaye\" Moss, accused Giuliani of using the bankruptcy process as a \"bad-faith litigation tactic\" and said \"he regards this court as a pause button on his woes.\"\n\nLane scolded Giuliani at one point for interrupting the hearing. The ex-mayor, joining by phone, called Freeman and Moss lawyer Rachel Strickland's comments -- including remarks about his many legal woes -- \"highly defamatory, your honor.\"\n\nPhilip Dublin, a lawyer for a committee of Giuliani's other creditors, said the committee would rather keep the bankruptcy case going with the appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee.\n\nGiuliani filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in December, days after the former election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \"Shaye\" Moss, won their defamation case. They said Giuliani's targeting of them because of Trump's lies about the 2020 election being stolen led to death threats that made them fear for their lives.\n\nEarlier this month, Giuliani requested that his Chapter 11 bankruptcy case be converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation -- which would have seen a trustee appointed to take control of his assets and sell many of them off to help pay creditors. Reconsidering that idea on Wednesday and pushing for a dismissal instead, Fischoff noted that administrative fees related to liquidation would \"consume if not 100%, a substantial portion of the assets.\"\n\nIf the bankruptcy is dismissed, Freeman and Moss could bring their effort to collect on the $148 million award back to the court in Washington, D.C., where they won their lawsuit, and avoid having to pay more legal fees for bankruptcy court. Lane said a dismissal would include a 12-month ban on Giuliani filing again for bankruptcy protection.\n\nFreeman and Moss, meanwhile, have a pending request before the judge to declare that the $148 million judgment cannot be discharged -- or dismissed -- during Giuliani's bankruptcy.\n\nThe bankruptcy is one of a host of legal woes consuming Giuliani. Last week, the former federal prosecutor was disbarred as an attorney in New York after a court found that he repeatedly made false statements about Trump's 2020 election loss. He is also facing the possibility of losing his law license in Washington after a board in May recommended that he be disbarred.\n\nIn Georgia and Arizona, Giuliani is facing criminal charges over his role in the effort to overturn the 2020 election. He has pleaded not guilty in both cases.\n\nWhen he filed for bankruptcy, Giuliani listed nearly $153 million in existing or potential debts, including almost $1 million in state and federal tax liabilities, money he owes lawyers, and many millions of dollars in potential judgments in lawsuits against him. He estimated he had assets worth $1 million to $10 million.\n\nIn his most recent financial filings in the bankruptcy case, he said he had about $94,000 cash in hand at the end of May while his company, Giuliani Communications, had about $237,000 in the bank. A main source of income for Giuliani over the past two years has been a retirement account with a balance of just over $1 million in May, down from nearly $2.5 million in 2022 after his withdrawals, the filings say.\n\nIn May, he spent nearly $33,000 including nearly $28,000 for condo and co-op costs for his Florida and New York City homes. He also spent about $850 on food, $390 on cleaning services, $230 on medicine, $200 on laundry and $190 on vehicles.\n\nMore from this section\n\nVice Capital Markets Launches Integration with Fannie Mae Mission Score API\n\nDr. Anju Mathur Supports Chronic Disease Day with Functional Medicine for a Blue Zone Lifestyle\n\nEighteen homebuyer assistance programs offering up to $117,000 are available to help people with disabilities and family caregivers purchase or modify a home", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kulr8.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michael_r_sisak@kulr8.com", "name": "Michael R.

One group of creditors asked Lane to appoint a trustee to take over Giuliani's finances and businesses, which could lead to a lengthy and contested bankruptcy liquidation, while another group said Giuliani should be kicked out of bankruptcy altogether.\n\nAll three options pose significant risks for Giuliani.\n\nLane said dismissal was likely the best option, given the difficulties the court has had in getting straight answers from Giuliani about his finances. A trustee would likely face the same problems getting Giuliani's cooperation, while incurring additional expenses that would reduce Giuliani's ability to pay creditors, Lane said.\n\n\"I'm concerned that the difficulties we've encountered on transparency will continue,\" Lane said.\n\nA dismissal of his bankruptcy would allow Giuliani's creditors to resume lawsuits against him, but it would also give him more freedom to appeal the $148 million defamation judgment that forced him to seek bankruptcy protection.\n\n\"We believe that the debtor's best chance of getting an appellate determination would be dismissal,\" Giuliani attorney Gary Fischoff said during Wednesday's court hearing.\n\nLane previously stopped Giuliani from spending money on the appeal while he was bankrupt, saying his Chapter 11 filing had paused litigation on both sides.\n\nRachel Strickland, representing the former Georgia election workers Wandrea \"Shaye\" Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, said Giuliani should be kicked out of bankruptcy so her clients can try to collect on their judgment against him.\n\nGiuliani \"regards this court as a pause button on his woes while he continues to live his life unbothered,\" Strickland told Lane.\n\nMoss and Freeman, who are Black, faced a deluge of racist and sexist messages, including threats of lynching, after Trump and his allies spread false claims that they were engaged in voter fraud.\n\nA committee representing Giuliani's other creditors asked Lane to instead appoint a trustee to take over Giuliani's finances and businesses, like his podcasting engagements and coffee promotions. Committee attorney Phil Dublin said ending the bankruptcy now would create a \"race to the courthouse\" among the many people who have sued Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani's other creditors include former employee Noelle Dunphy, who has accused Giuliani of sexual assault and wage theft, and the voting machine companies Dominion and Smartmatic, who have also sued Giuliani for defamation. Giuliani has denied the allegations.\n\nIn addition to the civil lawsuits, Giuliani is facing criminal charges in Georgia and Arizona for aiding Trump's efforts to subvert the 2020 election results, and his false claims about the election have caused him to lose his license to practice law in New York.", "source": {"uri": "cyprus-mail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cyprus Mail"}, "authors":

Would you get them on the phone and stop -- \" Giuliani shouted, appearing to refer to his spokesperson Ted Goodman.\n\n\"Alright, someone's got a live microphone, and that's not a good situation,\" the bankruptcy judge said.\n\nAs muffled noises continued to emerge from Giuliani's phone line, the judge, Sean H. Lane, tried to silence it.\n\n\"We keep having that same telephone pop up,\" Lane said. \"Let me ask in court if we can make sure to have that muted, please.\"\n\n\"Your honor, this is the Rudolph Giuliani,\" Giuliani said amid the static of his phone. He asked for a break to talk to his lawyers and address Strickland's \"defamatory remarks.\"\n\nLane asked Giuliani to wait his turn to speak. Later in the hearing, Giuliani's attorney Gary Fischoff assured the court that his client would not commit bankruptcy fraud.\n\n\"I just wanted to state something for the record,\" Fischoff said. \"There were some statements that the debtor would commit bankruptcy fraud. So I just wanted to state for the record that Mr. Giuliani, the debtor, would not commit any bankruptcy fraud.\"\n\nThe judge said he'll probably dismiss Giuliani's bankruptcy case\n\nWednesday's bankruptcy hearing comes at a major turning point for Giuliani's bankruptcy process -- where he may actually score a major legal win.\n\nGiuliani filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December, shortly after a jury in Washington, DC, found him liable for $148 million in damages for defaming Ruby Freeman and Wandrea Moss, the two election workers who he falsely claimed manipulated ballots in the 2020 election.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing paused their lawyers from enforcing the judgment against them, which formed nearly all of his $152 million in debt.\n\nIt also paused all the other civil cases against Giuliani, including a sexual abuse lawsuit from Noelle Dunphy and another defamation lawsuit from the election technology company Dominion Voting Systems.\n\nOver the past seven months, Giuliani has tried to buy time with motions to slow down the bankruptcy process as he appeals the $148 million judgment.\n\nAt the same time, creditors have accused Giuliani of filing misleading and incomplete financial statements, and of hiding streams of income.\n\nThey asked Lane to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee, who would have the power to seize legal control of his assets and sell them to satisfy everyone who was owed money. The trustee also may be able to waive attorney-client privilege on Giuliani's behalf, possibly opening him up to further legal risk.\n\nBut in court filings this week, lawyers for Giuliani, Freeman, and Moss all agreed that dismissing the bankruptcy case entirely would be the best course of action.\n\nThey said Giuliani would agree not to file for bankruptcy again for another year, giving time for appeals in the $148 million defamation judgment to play out.\n\n\"It is in the interest of creditors for their claims to be heard in the forum of their choosing\" and not bankruptcy court, Strickland said in Wednesday's hearing.\n\nLane said he was inclined to agree and dismiss the bankruptcy, citing \"the difficulties we've had in terms of transparency in this case.\"\n\n\"That's not going to magically change if you continue the case in 11 with the trustee,\" Lane said.\n\nThe judge said that a Chapter 11 trustee could easily liquidate Giuliani's two apartments and jewelry, which comprise the bulk of his estimated $8 million estate.\n\nBut liquidating Giuliani's other assets, like his media company and coffee operation, would be difficult to disentangle from the former New York City mayor's personal brand, he said. Dealing with those could incur expenses that would ultimately come out of the pockets of creditors who were owed money, the judge said.\n\nPhilip Dublin, an attorney representing the other creditors in the bankruptcy -- including Dunphy and Dominion -- objected to that plan.\n\nHe said the best way to fairly split Giuliani's assets would be to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee who would liquidate Giuliani's assets.\n\nBut Strickland said her clients had priority -- and they wanted the case dismissed.\n\n\"We are the significant focus of the case,\" she said. \"We are $148 million.\"\n\nThe judge said he would issue an order by Friday and asked the parties to meet and figure out how to pay expenses for a discovery vendor, a third-party company that has already done months of work obtaining and organizing Giuliani's records for the case.\n\nLane also said he would not approve Giuliani's preferred backup plan of converting the bankruptcy process from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7, which would allow him to save future income for himself while liquidating his current assets.\n\nJustin Kelton, an attorney representing Dunphy, told Business Insider that she would continue to pursue her sexual abuse claims in court if the judge dismissed the bankruptcy case.\n\n\"Our client Noelle Dunphy remains as strong and steadfast as ever in her commitment to pursuing justice,\" he said. \"If Mr. Giuliani's bankruptcy is dismissed, she will continue pursuing her claims in court, and we look forward to the day when we can present this case to a jury.\"\n\nGiuliani has brought upon himself a barrage of indignities as he falsely insisted that the 2020 election results were rigged.\n\nIn addition to his numerous civil cases, the former US attorney and personal lawyer to Donald Trump was disbarred in New York and is on the verge of losing his law license in Washington, DC.\n\nHe was also indicted in two criminal cases, in Georgia and Arizona, over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in those states.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_shamsian@yahoo.com", "name": "Jacob Shamsian", "type":

Would you get them on the phone and stop -- \" Giuliani shouted, appearing to refer to his spokesperson Ted Goodman.\n\n\"Alright, someone's got a live microphone, and that's not a good situation,\" the bankruptcy judge said.\n\nAs muffled noises continued to emerge from Giuliani's phone line, the judge, Sean H. Lane, tried to silence it.\n\n\"We keep having that same telephone pop up,\" Lane said. \"Let me ask in court if we can make sure to have that muted, please.\"\n\n\"Your honor, this is the Rudolph Giuliani,\" Giuliani said amid the static of his phone. He asked for a break to talk to his lawyers and address Strickland's \"defamatory remarks.\"\n\nLane asked Giuliani to wait his turn to speak. Later in the hearing, Giuliani's attorney Gary Fischoff assured the court that his client would not commit bankruptcy fraud.\n\n\"I just wanted to state something for the record,\" Fischoff said. \"There were some statements that the debtor would commit bankruptcy fraud. So I just wanted to state for the record that Mr. Giuliani, the debtor, would not commit any bankruptcy fraud.\"\n\nThe judge said he'll probably dismiss Giuliani's bankruptcy case\n\nWednesday's bankruptcy hearing comes at a major turning point for Giuliani's bankruptcy process -- where he may actually score a major legal win.\n\nGiuliani filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December, shortly after a jury in Washington, DC, found him liable for $148 million in damages for defaming Ruby Freeman and Wandrea Moss, the two election workers who he falsely claimed manipulated ballots in the 2020 election.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing paused their lawyers from enforcing the judgment against them, which formed nearly all of his $152 million in debt.\n\nIt also paused all the other civil cases against Giuliani, including a sexual abuse lawsuit from Noelle Dunphy and another defamation lawsuit from the election technology company Dominion Voting Systems.\n\nOver the past seven months, Giuliani has tried to buy time with motions to slow down the bankruptcy process as he appeals the $148 million judgment.\n\nAt the same time, creditors have accused Giuliani of filing misleading and incomplete financial statements, and of hiding streams of income.\n\nThey asked Lane to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee, who would have the power to seize legal control of his assets and sell them to satisfy everyone who was owed money. The trustee also may be able to waive attorney-client privilege on Giuliani's behalf, possibly opening him up to further legal risk.\n\nBut in court filings this week, lawyers for Giuliani, Freeman, and Moss all agreed that dismissing the bankruptcy case entirely would be the best course of action.\n\nThey said Giuliani would agree not to file for bankruptcy again for another year, giving time for appeals in the $148 million defamation judgment to play out.\n\n\"It is in the interest of creditors for their claims to be heard in the forum of their choosing\" and not bankruptcy court, Strickland said in Wednesday's hearing.\n\nLane said he was inclined to agree and dismiss the bankruptcy, citing \"the difficulties we've had in terms of transparency in this case.\"\n\n\"That's not going to magically change if you continue the case in 11 with the trustee,\" Lane said.\n\nThe judge said that a Chapter 11 trustee could easily liquidate Giuliani's two apartments and jewelry, which comprise the bulk of his estimated $8 million estate.\n\nBut liquidating Giuliani's other assets, like his media company and coffee operation, would be difficult to disentangle from the former New York City mayor's personal brand, he said. Dealing with those could incur expenses that would ultimately come out of the pockets of creditors who were owed money, the judge said.\n\nPhilip Dublin, an attorney representing the other creditors in the bankruptcy -- including Dunphy and Dominion -- objected to that plan.\n\nHe said the best way to fairly split Giuliani's assets would be to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee who would liquidate Giuliani's assets.\n\nBut Strickland said her clients had priority -- and they wanted the case dismissed.\n\n\"We are the significant focus of the case,\" she said. \"We are $148 million.\"\n\nThe judge said he would issue an order by Friday and asked the parties to meet and figure out how to pay expenses for a discovery vendor, a third-party company that has already done months of work obtaining and organizing Giuliani's records for the case.\n\nLane also said he would not approve Giuliani's preferred backup plan of converting the bankruptcy process from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7, which would allow him to save future income for himself while liquidating his current assets.\n\nJustin Kelton, an attorney representing Dunphy, told Business Insider that she would continue to pursue her sexual abuse claims in court if the judge dismissed the bankruptcy case.\n\n\"Our client Noelle Dunphy remains as strong and steadfast as ever in her commitment to pursuing justice,\" he said. \"If Mr. Giuliani's bankruptcy is dismissed, she will continue pursuing her claims in court, and we look forward to the day when we can present this case to a jury.\"\n\nGiuliani has brought upon himself a barrage of indignities as he falsely insisted that the 2020 election results were rigged.\n\nIn addition to his numerous civil cases, the former US attorney and personal lawyer to Donald Trump was disbarred in New York and is on the verge of losing his law license in Washington, DC.\n\nHe was also indicted in two criminal cases, in Georgia and Arizona, over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in those states.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"},

A dismissal would end his pursuit of bankruptcy protection, but it wouldn't let him off the hook for his debts. His creditors could pursue other legal remedies to recoup at least some of the money they're owed, such as getting a court order to seize his apartments and other assets.\n\nU.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane said he plans to issue a decision by the end of the week. He scheduled a hearing for 1 p.m. Friday and could make his ruling at that time. Lane ruled out converting the case to a liquidation, as Giuliani had recently requested, saying that doing so would not be in the best interest of people and entities he's indebted to.\n\n\"I'm leaning toward dismissal frankly because I'm concerned that the past is prologue,\" Lane said during a hybrid in-person and Zoom status hearing in White Plains, New York.\n\nGiuliani's lawyer, Gary Fischoff, said dismissing the case -- which has been roiled by allegations that the ex-mayor is flouting bankruptcy laws and potentially hiding assets -- would allow him to pursue an appeal in the defamation case, which arose from his efforts to overturn Donald Trump's 2020 election loss.\n\nA lawyer for the former election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \"Shaye\" Moss, accused Giuliani of using the bankruptcy process as a \"bad-faith litigation tactic\" and said \"he regards this court as a pause button on his woes.\"\n\nLane scolded Giuliani at one point for interrupting the hearing. The ex-mayor, joining by phone, called Freeman and Moss lawyer Rachel Strickland's comments -- including remarks about his many legal woes -- \"highly defamatory, your honor.\"\n\nPhilip Dublin, a lawyer for a committee of Giuliani's other creditors, said the committee would rather keep the bankruptcy case going with the appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee.\n\nGiuliani filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in December, days after the former election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \"Shaye\" Moss, won their defamation case. They said Giuliani's targeting of them because of Trump's lies about the 2020 election being stolen led to death threats that made them fear for their lives.\n\nEarlier this month, Giuliani requested that his Chapter 11 bankruptcy case be converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation -- which would have seen a trustee appointed to take control of his assets and sell many of them off to help pay creditors. Reconsidering that idea on Wednesday and pushing for a dismissal instead, Fischoff noted that administrative fees related to liquidation would \"consume if not 100%, a substantial portion of the assets.\"\n\nIf the bankruptcy is dismissed, Freeman and Moss could bring their effort to collect on the $148 million award back to the court in Washington, D.C., where they won their lawsuit, and avoid having to pay more legal fees for bankruptcy court. Lane said a dismissal would include a 12-month ban on Giuliani filing again for bankruptcy protection.\n\nFreeman and Moss, meanwhile, have a pending request before the judge to declare that the $148 million judgment cannot be discharged -- or dismissed -- during Giuliani's bankruptcy.\n\nThe bankruptcy is one of a host of legal woes consuming Giuliani. Last week, the former federal prosecutor was disbarred as an attorney in New York after a court found that he repeatedly made false statements about Trump's 2020 election loss. He is also facing the possibility of losing his law license in Washington after a board in May recommended that he be disbarred.\n\nIn Georgia and Arizona, Giuliani is facing criminal charges over his role in the effort to overturn the 2020 election. He has pleaded not guilty in both cases.\n\nWhen he filed for bankruptcy, Giuliani listed nearly $153 million in existing or potential debts, including almost $1 million in state and federal tax liabilities, money he owes lawyers, and many millions of dollars in potential judgments in lawsuits against him. He estimated he had assets worth $1 million to $10 million.\n\nIn his most recent financial filings in the bankruptcy case, he said he had about $94,000 cash in hand at the end of May while his company, Giuliani communications, had about $237,000 in the bank. A main source of income for Giuliani over the past two years has been a retirement account with a balance of just over $1 million in May, down from nearly $2.5 million in 2022 after his withdrawals, the filings say.\n\nIn May, he spent nearly $33,000 including nearly $28,000 for condo and co-op costs for his Florida and New York City homes. He also spent about $850 on food, $390 on cleaning services, $230 on medicine, $200 on laundry and $190 on vehicles.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

One group of creditors asked Lane to appoint a trustee to take over Giuliani's finances and businesses, which could lead to a lengthy and contested bankruptcy liquidation, while another group said Giuliani should be kicked out of bankruptcy altogether.\n\nAll three options pose significant risks for Giuliani.\n\nLane said dismissal was likely the best option, given the difficulties the court has had in getting straight answers from Giuliani about his finances. A trustee would likely face the same problems getting Giuliani's cooperation, while incurring additional expenses that would reduce Giuliani's ability to pay creditors, Lane said.\n\n\"I'm concerned that the difficulties we've encountered on transparency will continue,\" Lane said.\n\nA dismissal of his bankruptcy would allow Giuliani's creditors to resume lawsuits against him, but it would also give him more\n\nfreedom to appeal\n\nthe\n\n$148 million defamation judgment\n\nthat forced him to seek bankruptcy protection.\n\n\"We believe that the debtor's best chance of getting an appellate determination would be dismissal,\" Giuliani attorney Gary Fischoff said during Wednesday's court hearing.\n\nRachel Strickland, representing the former Georgia election workers Wandrea \"Shaye\" Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, said Giuliani should be kicked out of bankruptcy so her clients can try to collect on their judgment against him.\n\nGiuliani \"regards this court as a pause button on his woes while he continues to live his life unbothered by creditors,\" Strickland told Lane.\n\nA committee representing Giuliani's other creditors asked Lane to instead appoint a trustee to take over Giuliani's finances and businesses, like his podcasting engagements and coffee promotions. Committee attorney Phil Dublin said ending the bankruptcy now would create a \"race to the courthouse\" among the many people who have sued Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani's other creditors include former employee Noelle Dunphy, who has accused Giuliani of sexual assault and wage theft, and the voting machine companies Dominion and Smartmatic, who have also sued Giuliani for defamation. Giuliani has denied the allegations.\n\nIn addition to the civil lawsuits, Giuliani is facing criminal charges in Georgia and Arizona for aiding Trump's efforts to subvert the 2020 election results, and his false claims about the election have caused him to lose his license to practice law in New York.

But his debts aren't going away. - The Boston Globe", "body": "\"I'm leaning toward dismissal frankly because I'm concerned that the past is prologue,\" Lane said during a hybrid in-person and Zoom status hearing in White Plains, New York.\n\nGiuliani's lawyer, Gary Fischoff, said dismissing the case -- which has been roiled by allegations that the ex-mayor is flouting bankruptcy laws and potentially hiding assets -- would allow him to pursue an appeal in the defamation case, which arose from his efforts to overturn Donald Trump's 2020 election loss.\n\nA lawyer for the former election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \"Shaye\" Moss, accused Giuliani of using the bankruptcy process as a \"bad-faith litigation tactic\" and said \"he regards this court as a pause button on his woes.\"\n\nLane scolded Giuliani at one point for interrupting the hearing. The ex-mayor, joining by phone, called Freeman and Moss lawyer Rachel Strickland's comments -- including remarks about his many legal woes -- \"highly defamatory, your honor.\"\n\nPhilip Dublin, a lawyer for a committee of Giuliani's other creditors, said the committee would rather keep the bankruptcy case going with the appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee.\n\nGiuliani filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in December, days after the former election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \"Shaye\" Moss, won their defamation case. They said Giuliani's targeting of them because of Trump's lies about the 2020 election being stolen led to death threats that made them fear for their lives.\n\nEarlier this month, Giuliani requested that his Chapter 11 bankruptcy case be converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation -- which would have seen a trustee appointed to take control of his assets and sell many of them off to help pay creditors. Reconsidering that idea on Wednesday and pushing for a dismissal instead, Fischoff noted that administrative fees related to liquidation would \"consume if not 100%, a substantial portion of the assets.\"\n\nIf the bankruptcy is dismissed, Freeman and Moss could bring their effort to collect on the $148 million award back to the court in Washington, D.C., where they won their lawsuit, and avoid having to pay more legal fees for bankruptcy court. Lane said a dismissal would include a 12-month ban on Giuliani filing again for bankruptcy protection.\n\nFreeman and Moss, meanwhile, have a pending request before the judge to declare that the $148 million judgment cannot be discharged -- or dismissed -- during Giuliani's bankruptcy.\n\nThe bankruptcy is one of a host of legal woes consuming Giuliani. Last week, the former federal prosecutor was disbarred as an attorney in New York after a court found that he repeatedly made false statements about Trump's 2020 election loss. He is also facing the possibility of losing his law license in Washington after a board in May recommended that he be disbarred.\n\nIn Georgia and Arizona, Giuliani is facing criminal charges over his role in the effort to overturn the 2020 election. He has pleaded not guilty in both cases.\n\nWhen he filed for bankruptcy, Giuliani listed nearly $153 million in existing or potential debts, including almost $1 million in state and federal tax liabilities, money he owes lawyers, and many millions of dollars in potential judgments in lawsuits against him. He estimated he had assets worth $1 million to $10 million.\n\nIn his most recent financial filings in the bankruptcy case, he said he had about $94,000 cash in hand at the end of May while his company, Giuliani communications, had about $237,000 in the bank. A main source of income for Giuliani over the past two years has been a retirement account with a balance of just over $1 million in May, down from nearly $2.5 million in 2022 after his withdrawals, the filings say.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki",

Fischoff said a dismissal means those other creditors would be \"free to pursue\" their cases in court, since a dismissal would lift the stay on the ongoing cases against him.\n\nHowever, Phil Dublin, a lawyer for the creditors' committee, said his clients prefer to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee rather than dismissing the case, arguing that the appointment of a trustee would result in the \"most equitable outcome\" for the creditors. Dublin added that keeping it as a Chapter 11 case would permit investigations into his finances, including the alleged unpaid $2 million in legal fees owed by Donald Trump, the Trump campaign or the Republican National Committee.\n\nThe former mayor's assets would still be available to creditors, Giuliani's lawyer argued. His only income is social service payments, Fischoff said, adding that he's \"an 80-year-old disbarred attorney who may choose to discontinue working\" should a Chapter 11 trustee be appointed.\n\nStrickland pounced on his own lawyer's admission: \"We all suspect that if a trustee is appointed, Giuliani is going to sit on his butt.\" She added that if the former mayor is working for himself, \"I suspect he will be hustling for Rudy Coffee and all the rest of his money-making endeavors\" and funneling cash to all of the businesses that he claims are out of the reach of creditors.\n\nGiuliani \"regards this court as a pause button on his woes\" while he continues to live his life, she said.\n\nThe judge said he hopes to make a ruling on the matter before the end of the week -- but disclosed that he is \"leaning toward dismissal.\"\n\n\"I'm concerned that what's past is prologue...and that issues about transparency will continue,\" the judge explained.\n\nThe creditors' committee has complained in filings about the lack of transparency into his finances.\n\nThe committee has taken issue with his \"deficiencies in his financial reporting and disclosures,\" like discrepencies related to payments on his Florida condo, his \"unauthorized payments\" to his alleged \"girlfriend,\" and his failure to comply with discovery requests.\n\nBecause he did not comply with the requests, the committee asked on June 28 that the court to hold him in contempt and impose sanctions. In a July 8 filing, the committee's lawyers accused the former US attorney of treating \"the bankruptcy process as a joke, hiding behind the fa\u00e7ade of an elderly, doddering man.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Giuliani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trustee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trustee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_New_York_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of New York City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_7,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debtor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Debtor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disbarment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disbarment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/574d0dab5f43b6a59befcced6673ceda", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722169", "eventUri": "eng-9722169", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-08", "textStart": 1571, "textEnd": 1577, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 4407, "textEnd": 4414}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nKeeping the case in bankruptcy court would inevitably lead to Giuliani hiding his assets and being charged with bankruptcy crimes, Strickland said.\n\n\"We will all be stayed while the trustee in this court wades through the morass of sexual assault and other allegations while Mr. Giuliani continues to play golf,\" Strickland said, her voice scathing.\n\nGiuliani's attorneys appeared in person in Manhattan's bankruptcy court for the hearing, but Giuliani himself called in by phone.\n\n\"Ted! Would you get them on the phone and stop -- \" Giuliani shouted, appearing to refer to his spokesperson Ted Goodman.\n\n\"Alright, someone's got a live microphone, and that's not a good situation,\" the bankruptcy judge said.\n\nAs muffled noises continued to emerge from Giuliani's phone line, the judge, Sean H. Lane, tried to silence it.\n\n\"We keep having that same telephone pop up,\" Lane said. \"Let me ask in court if we can make sure to have that muted, please.\"\n\n\"Your honor, this is the Rudolph Giuliani,\" Giuliani said amid the static of his phone. He asked for a break to talk to his lawyers and address Strickland's \"defamatory remarks.\"\n\nLane asked Giuliani to wait his turn to speak. Later in the hearing, Giuliani's attorney Gary Fischoff assured the court that his client would not commit bankruptcy fraud.\n\n\"I just wanted to state something for the record,\" Fischoff said. \"There were some statements that the debtor would commit bankruptcy fraud. So I just wanted to state for the record that Mr. Giuliani, the debtor, would not commit any bankruptcy fraud.\"\n\nWednesday's bankruptcy hearing comes at a major turning point for Giuliani's bankruptcy process -- where he may actually score a major legal win.\n\nGiuliani filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December, shortly after a jury in Washington, DC, found him liable for $148 million in damages for defaming Ruby Freeman and Wandrea Moss, the two election workers who he falsely claimed manipulated ballots in the 2020 election.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing paused their lawyers from enforcing the judgment against them, which formed nearly all of his $152 million in debt.\n\nIt also paused all the other civil cases against Giuliani, including a sexual abuse lawsuit from Noelle Dunphy and another defamation lawsuit from the election technology company Dominion Voting Systems.\n\nOver the past seven months, Giuliani has tried to buy time with motions to slow down the bankruptcy process as he appeals the $148 million judgment.\n\nAt the same time, creditors have accused Giuliani of filing misleading and incomplete financial statements, and of hiding streams of income.\n\nThey asked Lane to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee, who would have the power to seize legal control of his assets and sell them to satisfy everyone who was owed money. The trustee also may be able to waive attorney-client privilege on Giuliani's behalf, possibly opening him up to further legal risk.\n\nBut in court filings this week, lawyers for Giuliani, Freeman, and Moss all agreed that dismissing the bankruptcy case entirely would be the best course of action.\n\nThey said Giuliani would agree not to file for bankruptcy again for another year, giving time for appeals in the $148 million defamation judgment to play out.\n\n\"It is in the interest of creditors for their claims to be heard in the forum of their choosing\" and not bankruptcy court, Strickland said in Wednesday's hearing.\n\nLane said he was inclined to agree and dismiss the bankruptcy, citing \"the difficulties we've had in terms of transparency in this case.\"\n\n\"That's not going to magically change if you continue the case in 11 with the trustee,\" Lane said.\n\nThe judge said that a Chapter 11 trustee could easily liquidate Giuliani's two apartments and jewelry, which comprise the bulk of his estimated $8 million estate.\n\nBut liquidating Giuliani's other assets, like his media company and coffee operation, would be difficult to disentangle from the former New York City mayor's personal brand, he said. Dealing with those could incur expenses that would ultimately come out of the pockets of creditors who were owed money, the judge said.\n\nPhilip Dublin, an attorney representing the other creditors in the bankruptcy -- including Dunphy and Dominion -- objected to that plan.\n\nHe said the best way to fairly split Giuliani's assets would be to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee who would liquidate Giuliani's assets.\n\nBut Strickland said her clients had priority -- and they wanted the case dismissed.\n\n\"We are the significant focus of the case,\" she said. \"We are $148 million.\"\n\nThe judge said he would issue an order by Friday and asked the parties to meet and figure out how to pay expenses for a discovery vendor, a third-party company that has already done months of work obtaining and organizing Giuliani's records for the case.\n\nLane also said he would not approve Giuliani's preferred backup plan of converting the bankruptcy process from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7, which would allow him to save future income for himself while liquidating his current assets.\n\nJustin Kelton, an attorney representing Dunphy, told Business Insider that she would continue to pursue her sexual abuse claims in court if the judge dismissed the bankruptcy case.\n\n\"Our client Noelle Dunphy remains as strong and steadfast as ever in her commitment to pursuing justice,\" he said. \"If Mr. Giuliani's bankruptcy is dismissed, she will continue pursuing her claims in court, and we look forward to the day when we can present this case to a jury.\"\n\nGiuliani has brought upon himself a barrage of indignities as he falsely insisted that the 2020 election results were rigged.\n\nIn addition to his numerous civil cases, the former US attorney and personal lawyer to Donald Trump was disbarred in New York and is on the verge of losing his law license in Washington, DC.\n\nHe was also indicted in two criminal cases, in Georgia and Arizona, over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in those states.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_shamsian@businessinsider.com",

One group of creditors asked Lane to appoint a trustee to take over Giuliani's finances and businesses, which could lead to a lengthy and contested bankruptcy liquidation, while another group said Giuliani should be kicked out of bankruptcy altogether.\n\nAll three options pose significant risks for Giuliani.\n\nLane said dismissal was likely the best option, given the difficulties the court has had in getting straight answers from Giuliani about his finances. A trustee would likely face the same problems getting Giuliani's cooperation, while incurring additional expenses that would reduce Giuliani's ability to pay creditors, Lane said.\n\n\"I'm concerned that the difficulties we've encountered on transparency will continue,\" Lane said.\n\nA dismissal of his bankruptcy would allow Giuliani's creditors to resume lawsuits against him, but it would also give him more\n\n\"We believe that the debtor's best chance of getting an appellate determination would be dismissal,\" Giuliani attorney Gary Fischoff said during Wednesday's court hearing.\n\nRachel Strickland, representing the former Georgia election workers Wandrea \"Shaye\" Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, said Giuliani should be kicked out of bankruptcy so her clients can try to collect on their judgment against him.\n\nGiuliani \"regards this court as a pause button on his woes while he continues to live his life unbothered by creditors,\" Strickland told Lane.\n\nA committee representing Giuliani's other creditors asked Lane to instead appoint a trustee to take over Giuliani's finances and businesses, like his podcasting engagements and coffee promotions. Committee attorney Phil Dublin said ending the bankruptcy now would create a \"race to the courthouse\" among the many people who have sued Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani's other creditors include former employee Noelle Dunphy, who has accused Giuliani of sexual assault and wage theft, and the voting machine companies Dominion and Smartmatic, who have also sued Giuliani for defamation. Giuliani has denied the allegations.\n\nIn addition to the civil lawsuits, Giuliani is facing criminal charges in Georgia and Arizona for aiding Trump's efforts to subvert the 2020 election results, and his false claims about the election have caused him to lose his license to practice law in New York.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [],

But his debts aren't going away", "body": "By MICHAEL R. SISAK - Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- A judge said Wednesday he was leaning toward throwing out Rudy Giuliani 's bankruptcy case after lawyers for the cash-strapped former New York City mayor and his biggest creditors -- two ex-Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation judgment against him -- agreed this was the best way forward.\n\nThe case has been roiled by allegations Giuliani is flouting bankruptcy laws and potentially hiding assets. A dismissal would end his pursuit of bankruptcy protection, but it wouldn't let him off the hook for his debts. His creditors could pursue other legal remedies to recoup at least some of the money they're owed, such as getting a court order to seize his apartments and other assets.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Here's what we know July Fourth festivities in Western New York: Fireworks, music and food\n\nU.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane said he plans to issue a decision by the end of the week. He scheduled a hearing for 1 p.m. Friday and could make his ruling at that time. Lane ruled out converting the case to a liquidation, an option Giuliani recently proposed, saying that doing so would not be in the best interest of people and entities he's indebted to.\n\n\"I'm leaning toward dismissal, frankly, because I'm concerned that the past is prologue,\" Lane said during a hybrid in-person and Zoom status hearing in White Plains, New York.\n\nGiuliani's lawyer, Gary Fischoff, said dismissing the case would allow the ex-mayor to pursue an appeal in the defamation case, which arose from his efforts to overturn Donald Trump's 2020 election loss. Another alternative would be to have the Chapter 11 case continue while a court-appointed trustee takes control of Giuliani's assets.\n\nA lawyer for the former election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \"Shaye\" Moss, accused Giuliani of using the bankruptcy process as a \"bad-faith litigation tactic\" and said \"he regards this court as a pause button on his woes while he continues to live his life unbothered by creditors.\"\n\n\"The question here is always going to be the cat-and-mouse game of what dollar can be funneled outside of the estate,\" Freeman and Moss' lawyer Rachel Strickland said. \"Out in the real world, outside of bankruptcy, all dollars are fair game for everyone and Mr. Giuliani has to continue to live and do whatever it is he is able to do with his name, likeness and commentary in order to make a living.\"\n\nLane scolded Giuliani at one point for interrupting the hearing. The ex-mayor, joining by phone, called Strickland's comments \"highly defamatory, your honor.\"\n\nPhilip Dublin, a lawyer for a committee of Giuliani's other creditors, said the committee would rather keep the bankruptcy case going with the appointment of a trustee.\n\nGiuliani filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in December, days after the former election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \"Shaye\" Moss, won their defamation case. They said Giuliani's targeting of them because of Trump's lies about the 2020 election being stolen led to death threats that made them fear for their lives.\n\nEarlier this month, Giuliani requested that the case be converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation -- which would have seen a trustee appointed to take control of his assets and sell them off to help pay creditors. Reconsidering that idea on Wednesday and pushing for a dismissal instead, Fischoff noted that administrative fees related to liquidation would \"consume if not 100%, a substantial portion of the assets.\"\n\nIf the bankruptcy is dismissed, Freeman and Moss could bring their effort to collect on the $148 million award back to the court in Washington, D.C., where they won their lawsuit, and avoid having to pay more legal fees for bankruptcy court. Lane said a dismissal would include a 12-month ban on Giuliani filing again for bankruptcy protection.\n\nFreeman and Moss, meanwhile, have a pending request before the judge to declare that the $148 million judgment cannot be discharged -- or dismissed -- during Giuliani's bankruptcy.\n\nThe bankruptcy is one of a host of legal woes consuming Giuliani, once heralded as \"America's Mayor\" for his calm and steady leadership after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nLast week, the ex-federal prosecutor and 2008 Republican presidential candidate was disbarred as an attorney in New York after a court found that he repeatedly made false statements about Trump's 2020 election loss. He is also facing the possibility of losing his law license in Washington after a board in May recommended that he be disbarred.\n\nIn Georgia and Arizona, Giuliani is facing criminal charges over his role in the effort to overturn the 2020 election. He has pleaded not guilty in both cases.\n\nWhen he filed for bankruptcy, Giuliani listed nearly $153 million in existing or potential debts, including almost $1 million in state and federal tax liabilities, money he owes lawyers, and many millions of dollars in potential judgments in lawsuits against him. He estimated he had assets worth $1 million to $10 million.\n\nIn his most recent financial filings in the bankruptcy case, he said he had about $94,000 cash in hand at the end of May while his company, Giuliani Communications, had about $237,000 in the bank. A main source of income for Giuliani over the past two years has been a retirement account with a balance of just over $1 million in May, down from nearly $2.5 million in 2022 after his withdrawals, the filings say.\n\nIn May, he spent nearly $33,000 including nearly $28,000 for condo and co-op costs for his Florida and New York City homes. He also spent about $850 on food, $390 on cleaning services, $230 on medicine, $200 on laundry and $190 on vehicles.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

At one point, Giuliani vehemently objected out of turn to commentary from a lawyer for defamed 2020 election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, shouting that the attorney herself made \"highly defamatory\" remarks.\n\nLaw&Crime was listening in as lawyers for Giuliani, lawyers for Freeman and Moss, and lawyers for the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors each expressed their views to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane on how the former NYC mayor's Chapter 11 case should go from here.\n\nThe hearing was originally and mainly supposed to focus on Giuliani's recent attempt to convert the case from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization into a Chapter 7 liquidation of his assets, and on unsecured creditors' insistence that a Chapter 11 trustee be appointed to take control of Giuliani's assets, but before the hearing even began, the debtor filed a document consenting to the dismissal of his bankruptcy case, were the judge to allow it.\n\nThe Freeman plaintiffs, who back in December won a $148 million defamation judgment against Giuliani by default in Washington, D.C. -- as a sanction for discovery non-compliance -- were clear on Monday that they supported the outright dismissal of the case, and they pushed for dismissal in court again on Wednesday. But attorneys for the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, representing Noelle Dunphy, a former Giuliani employee who has filed a sexual assault and a hostile work environment lawsuit, and Dominion Voting Systems, remained adamant that the best course of action was to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee, or else their clients might never be compensated outside of bankruptcy.\n\nNear the start of the Wednesday proceeding, Giuliani attorney Gary Fischoff revealed that \"lengthy discussions\" with the Freeman plaintiffs continued into the morning, and the Giuliani \"seized on\" that opportunity to support dismissal or, in the alternative, a conversion of the case to Chapter 7, which would result in the appointment of a trustee to liquidate his assets, namely his multi-million dollar properties in New York and Florida, an IRA, and some jewelry \"perhaps.\"\n\n\"We're faced with three options today,\" Fischoff began: a Chapter 7 conversion, the appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee, or case dismissal.\n\nThe attorney said that the proposed order in favor of tossing the case included a \"12-month bar\" from the effective date of dismissal that would prevent Giuliani from initiating another bankruptcy action.\n\nGiuliani has long argued that he should be allowed to appeal the Freeman judgment while in bankruptcy, for the benefit of his creditors. But the judge has shut that down at every turn.\n\nFischoff explained that Giuliani's \"intention has always been\" to get appellate review of the defamation judgment, but because he has not been able to do so, he now views dismissal as the best path forward. The lawyer maintained that dismissal is in the best interests of creditors, though there are different categories of creditors.\n\nThe Freeman plaintiffs already have a judgment, but Dunphy, for instance, still has a pending lawsuit that has not reached an end. Dunphy and Dominion Voting Systems still have \"state law remedies they can exercise\" in the courts outside of bankruptcy, so they \"are not really prejudiced\" by dismissal, Fischoff argued.\n\nFischoff asserted that if a Chapter 7 trustee was appointed, the resulting \"administrative expenses\" would \"consume if not 100%, a substantial portion\" of Giuliani's assets, to the detriment of creditors. He said that creditors simply have a better shot of recovering money outside of bankruptcy than within it, and he suggested that his client, whom he described as an \"80-year-old disbarred attorney,\" could ultimately decide not to work to pay what is owed.\n\nRachel Strickland, an attorney for the Freeman plaintiffs, began her remarks by pointing out that Giuliani filed under Chapter 11 right after the defamation judgment and that, \"Before Giuliani could even say hello, he was trying to appeal the Freeman judgment\" while in bankruptcy.\n\nStrickland said that Giuliani has long indicated that if he was unsuccessful in efforts to appeal, a move to dismiss would follow.\n\n\"Today, that came true,\" she said, calling the bankruptcy filing a \"bad faith litigation tactic\" from the start that was \"undoubtedly\" brought to frustrate her clients by being a \"non-compliant debtor.\"\n\nThen Strickland started making remarks that would soon prompt Giuliani to shout on the Zoom call. She referred to the sexual assault allegations in Dunphy's lawsuit, which are graphic.\n\n\"The pleadings literally cite his Viagra usage,\" Strickland said. \"[This is] not what your honor wants to hear.\"\n\n\"Noelle Dunphy's case is painful to read,\" the attorney added.\n\nIt was Strickland's position that \"victims of this man\" have a better chance to have their claims heard in state court, rather than going down a Chapter 7 rabbit hole.\n\nThe attorney instead suggested that if the bankruptcy case were converted, Giuliani's lack of transparency in the case would remain unchanged and lead to possible \"bankruptcy crimes\" by, in Strickland's words, \"knowingly and fraudulently\" concealing financial details from a trustee.\n\n\"Unless your honor wants to entertain putting America's Mayor in prison,\" Strickland said, dismissal is the appropriate case outcome.\n\nThat's when Giuliani introduced himself out of turn.\n\n\"Your honor, this is Rudolph Giuliani,\" the debtor chimed in.\n\n\"I have an order of presentation,\" Lane reminded Giuliani.\n\n\"Will you get them on the phone?! It's highly defamatory, your honor!\" Giuliani yelled. \"I'd like a break.\"\n\nThe judge responded by threatening to mute Giuliani.\n\n\"I really do not want to be forced to have to cut your line off,\" the judge said.\n\nGiuliani did not speak again during the hearing.\n\nLater on in the proceeding, Fischoff made a statement on the heated exchange for the record, specifically that Strickland's comments in court about \"bankruptcy crimes\" are not evidence of anything whatsoever.\n\nThe judge agreed with Fischoff, but interpreted Strickland's words as gaming out how the case might in absence of dismissal given Giuliani's handling of the case to date.\n\nPhilip Dublin, arguing on behalf of the creditors committee, started his presentation by saying everyone can agree on one thing: \"Something important is going to happen today.\"\n\nDublin insisted that appointing a Chapter 11 trustee is the \"most equitable outcome for creditors as a whole.\" While he expressed \"respect and sympathy\" for the Freeman plaintiffs, Dublin was concerned that his clients, whom the firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP is representing pro bono, will not see any compensation if the case is dismissed.\n\nWhy? Dublin said the Freeman plaintiffs have a judgment and they are the ones would likely be paid first, and Giuliani's estate is estimated in the neighborhood of $8 to $10 million (based largely on the values of his properties upon sale).\n\nDublin said that keeping the bankruptcy case alive would allow creditors without judgments against Giuliani to potentially reach settlements and \"share in the value of the estate.\"\n\nWhen it was Strickland's turn to speak again, she suggested that, outside of bankruptcy, money is \"fair game for everyone\" and Giuliani would keep working to support himself.\n\n\"Chapter anything,\" Strickland said, is not going to do anything for any creditors. \"It's time for Rudy Giuliani to go back to the real world.\"\n\n\"Outside of bankruptcy, he can do whatever he wants,\" she added.\n\nPerhaps reading the tea leaves already, Dublin said that if Lane did decide to dismiss the case, the judge would first have to make sure ahead of time that there would be \"an appropriate reserve of funds\" to pay the forensic financial investigator Global Data Risk.\n\nAfter Strickland agreed that is an \"important step,\" Fischoff emphasized that Giuliani's \"cash assets are limited.\"\n\nFischoff was, in his words, \"aghast\" at the $400,000 that Dublin estimated would go to the forensic investigator.\n\n\"The debtor doesn't have $400,000 to put in escrow,\" he said. \"I'm a little aghast at the number.\"\n\nAfter Lane said the financials could be figured out \"fairly quickly\" and in due course after some clarity on \"professional fees,\" but for the purposes of the present day, it was clear to him that Chapter 7 conversion was not on the table.\n\n\"I don't see conversion to Chapter 7 as an option here,\" the judge said. \"I don't think it's in the best interest of the creditors.\"\n\nWhen considering whether to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee, as the creditors committee sought, or dismissal, as the Freeman plaintiffs asked for and Giuliani consented to, Lane was straightforward on where he's leaning.\n\n\"I'm leaning towards dismissal, frankly,\" the judge said, noting that he is \"concerned\" a lack of transparency on Giuliani's part would continue in bankruptcy.\n\nHe suggested that there could be a ruling by the end of the week, maybe Friday.\n\nNoelle Dunphy's attorney Justin Kelton told Law&Crime that their lawsuit against Giuliani will continue if the bankruptcy case is thrown out.\n\n\"Our client Noelle Dunphy remains as strong and steadfast as ever in her commitment to pursuing justice,\" Kelton said. \"If Mr. Giuliani's bankruptcy is dismissed, she will continue pursuing her claims in court, and we look forward to the day when we can present this case to a jury.\"\n\nLaw&Crime reached out to a Giuliani advisor for comment on today's events.", "source": {"uri": "lawandcrime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Law & Crime"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

the refusal to cooperate with the [bankruptcy] committee's discovery requests [and] the unending, wasteful, and abusive efforts to appeal the Freeman Judgment,\" Strickland wrote.\n\nShe called the attempt to convert from Chapter 11 bankruptcy to Chapter 7 a \"brazen\" move.\n\nStrickland wrote that converting to Chapter 7 liquidation would reward Giuliani's \"atrocious\" behavior and avoid his responsibilities to his bankruptcy committee.\n\n\"Successfully converting this case would result in the dissolution of the Committee, end the Committee's growing investigation into Mr. Giuliani's assets, and the related near-term threat of discovery sanctions.\"\n\n\"A Chapter 7 trustee will not be up to speed compared to the Committee and its advisors, who have now spent months getting familiar with the facts of this case.\"\n\n\"As such, conversion would merely reward atrocious behavior,\" she wrote.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_o_driscoll@newsweek.com", "name": "Sean O'Driscoll", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Giuliani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disbarment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disbarment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trustee_in_bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trustee in bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_New_York_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of New York City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_7,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bad faith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trustee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trustee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2425563/rudy-giuliani.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=b7d534c26e0e18c58ca689878c9fe500", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722169", "eventUri": "eng-9722169", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

Creditors are angry about that", "body": "A group of angry creditors will face-off against Rudy Giuliani in bankruptcy court on Wednesday, where they have asked a judge to put his finances under the control of an independent trustee in order to lock down his assets and begin to collect what they're owed.Related video above: Former Georgia election workers awarded $148M in civil suit against GiulianiSince declaring bankruptcy late last year, Giuliani appears to have remained flush with cash, including being paid $75,000 by a documentary project. He's also continued to spend thousands of dollars each month on dozens of Amazon, streaming media and other purchases, according to court records.Those transactions and a general lack of transparency around Giuliani's finances have drawn the ire and frustration of creditors seeking to enforce millions of dollars in claims against the former New York mayor, including $148 million in damages won by two Atlanta election workers who successfully argued in court last year that Giuliani defamed them after the 2020 election.At Wednesday's hearing, the creditors will push the judge presiding over the case to take drastic steps to rein in Giuliani's spending and potentially liquidate his assets, according to court filings they've made this week. And Giuliani may have to answer detailed questions under oath about his financial situation that he has so far refused to reveal.The hearing comes about a week after Giuliani lost his law license over his efforts in backing Donald Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Giuliani is also facing criminal charges in connection to those efforts in Georgia and Arizona.Giuliani's decision to file for Chapter 11 reorganization should have brought transparency to his finances and moved him toward a plan to pay his debts, bankruptcy experts say.Instead, Giuliani has provided only snippets or inaccurate portraits of his financial records, some of which were provided late. He has even surprised his own lawyers with new sources of income, such as a recent deal he signed to promote coffee.He has also managed to keep control of two condominiums worth millions in New York and Palm Beach, Florida, though he has been trying to sell the New York three-bedroom property.\"He's using as a delay tactic, not being forthcoming with the process, and just sort of ducking and weaving his way in and out,\" said Daniel Gielchinsky, a bankruptcy attorney based in Florida who is closely following the case. \"It's a real story from a fall from grace. It's somewhat shocking, but it's also sad.\"'Bankruptcy process as a joke'Giuliani's creditors - including Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, the two Georgia election workers whom he owes $148 million for defaming them after the 2020 election - are furious with how the bankruptcy has failed to progress to begin to make them whole more than six months since he declared bankruptcy.\"Since day one, Giuliani has regarded this case and the bankruptcy process as a joke, hiding behind the fa\u00e7ade of an elderly, doddering man who cannot even remember the address for his second multimillion dollar home and claims impending homelessness if he must sell that second multimillion dollar home,\" wrote lawyers from the law firm Akin Gump, which represents a committee of Giuliani's creditors in the bankruptcy proceeding. \"In reality, Giuliani has treated this Court, the bankruptcy process and the Committee ... with utter disrespect and without accountability. Giuliani is playing the delay game.\"Lawyers watching the case say that if Giuliani were to be assigned a Chapter 11 trustee by the judge Wednesday, that attorney could immediately move to sell his homes, so his creditors can collect, and take control of his companies like Giuliani Communications LLC, which court records say has received thousands of dollars in nominally explained wire transfers in recent monthsGiuliani's tacticsIn response, Giuliani has asked the bankruptcy judge to change the classification of his bankruptcy, from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7, which would limit the creditors' ability to pursue his incoming cash.Giuliani's close friend and colleague Maria Ryan last month sent a request to the bankruptcy judge to tell his creditors' law firm to \"stop lying in their filings to the court.\" She wrote that she and others who work for Giuliani are trying to keep his businesses afloat and promised to be quicker to alert his bankruptcy lawyers of new business deals.Giuliani's bankruptcy attorneys and his spokesman didn't provide additional comment to CNN for this story.Freeman and Moss on their own are taking a slightly different tactic than the broader creditors' committee, complaining to the court that Giuliani's responses to requests for information about his finances in bankruptcy court are insufficient and being done in bad faith.They want the bankruptcy judge on Wednesday to throw him out of bankruptcy court. That would allow their team of lawyers to pursue his assets directly, which would lose their current protections.\"Congress designed the Bankruptcy Code to ensure that bad faith debtors like Mr. Giuliani cannot successfully hop between various chapters to stay one step ahead of creditors,\" Moss and Freeman's lawyers wrote in a filing Monday night.Appeals of their defamation case against Giuliani currently are not allowed while his bankruptcy progresses, but he could have another shot to appeal the jury verdict if the judge grants his request for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\"He's definitely in a difficult position and he's still maneuvering. And he's being very shrewd in his maneuvers,\" Gielchinsky said. \"Will it result in his assets being sold? Or will it result in a change in his lifestyle? It's hard to say, because he's very hard to nail down.\"Spending and new dealsGiuliani's sporadic disclosures over the past several months offer glimpses into his finances. For instance, in recent weeks, according to his financial records available in court, Giuliani made 40 purchases from Amazon totaling nearly $3,500. He's also bought plane tickets for himself and two business associates to fly to Palm Beach and other places.He also has pocketed thousands of dollars from participating in a documentary film this spring, where money is being sent to his limited liability company, adding to the opaqueness around his finances.His lawyers told the creditors on May 22 that a years-old documentary project, called \"All the President's Men,\" was recently revived.Giuliani Communications received a $75,000 payment in mid-May for his ties to the project, according to a letter from his lawyers made public in court.

Those earnings are to be paid through wire transfers to a limited liability company Giuliani has, documents of his arrangements say.The coffee deal is set to bring in to Giuliani between $4 and $12 a bag, the documents say. A business associate told the court that as of mid-June, he had not been paid.\"Unfortunately, in this case, good news always seems to be accompanied with bad,\" lawyers for his creditors wrote to the bankruptcy judge last month. \"The Debtor is structuring the business deal in a way that funnels funds that would otherwise belong to his creditors\" back into Giuliani's pockets.When the creditors' lawyer noticed Giuliani promoting the Rudy beans in videos on social media in mid-May, they asked his lawyers about the venture. \"We saw the same thing and have requested information, and a cup of coffee,\" Giuliani's own bankruptcy lawyers told the creditors.\n\nA group of angry creditors will face-off against Rudy Giuliani in bankruptcy court on Wednesday, where they have asked a judge to put his finances under the control of an independent trustee in order to lock down his assets and begin to collect what they're owed.\n\nRelated video above: Former Georgia election workers awarded $148M in civil suit against Giuliani\n\nSince declaring bankruptcy late last year, Giuliani appears to have remained flush with cash, including being paid $75,000 by a documentary project.

over his campaign of lies.\n\n\"Everybody gets a chance to be heard but you cannot interrupt someone else while they're being heard,\" the judge chided Giuliani.\n\nThe judge told lawyers for Giuliani and his creditors, including election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, that he may decide as soon as Friday to pull the plug on Giuliani's entire bankruptcy case.\n\nHe cited a lack of \"transparency\" from the onetime personal lawyer for former President Trump.\n\n\"I'm leaning towards dismissal, frankly, because I'm concerned that the past is prologue and that issues about transparency will continue,\" said Lane, a bankruptcy judge in Manhattan federal court.\n\nIf the judge dismisses the bankruptcy case, Freeman and Moss could seek to immediately seize Giuliani's assets, including his multi-million dollar homes in Manhattan and Florida.\n\nGiuliani's lawyer told the judge he does not object to dismissing the case, even though it was Giuliani himself who filed for bankruptcy protection last December after a jury socked him with the massive judgment.\n\nWithout elaborating, he said Giuliani would have a better chance of upending the judgment on appeal if the bankruptcy case were dismissed.\n\nRachel Strickland, a lawyer for the two election workers, said they agree with dismissing the case because they fear Giuliani is using the bankruptcy proceedings to \"push pause\" on his financial woes without making any changes to his lavish lifestyle.\n\nShe argued against an alternate plan to appoint a trustee to manage Giuliani's financial affairs, suggesting he would try to funnel cash and assets to entities outside the reach of creditors.\n\n\"If the case is dismissed, creditors will be able to hold America's mayor accountable for the harms he's caused,\" she said.\n\nGiuliani owns an opulent co-op on Manhattan's upper East Side that is on the market for $5.7 million and a condo in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nGiuliani was found liable for engineering a disinformation campaign that accused Freeman and Moss of rigging votes for President Biden during ballot-counting in the Democratic stronghold of Fulton County.\n\nBiden narrowly won Georgia but Trump and Giuliani falsely claim the win was tainted by widespread fraud.", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Giuliani's bankruptcy was precipitated by a jury's $148 million verdict against him after he baselessly accused the women of 2020 election fraud.\n\n\"Let me ask in court if we can make sure to have that muted, please,\" Lane said.\n\n\"Your honor, this is Rudolph Giuliani,\" the ex-mayor explained.\n\nSpeaking over each other, Lane sought to pull Giuliani into line. But Giuliani insisted he should be allowed to push back against the election workers' lawyer, who had just warned that the ex-mayor's conduct throughout the bankruptcy could force the judge to \"entertain putting America's mayor in prison.\"\n\n\"Highly defamatory, your honor!\" Giuliani exclaimed.\n\n\"So I'm going to ask you to listen to me, and if you don't, I'm going to have to cut you off,\" the judge replied, after which Giuliani remained silent.\n\nGiuliani's bankruptcy has reached a crossroads after six months of increasing pressure from his creditors, who all accuse the former federal prosecutor of using bankruptcy as a delay tactic while he hides assets and spends egregiously.\n\nThe election workers want to dismiss the bankruptcy, which would unfreeze their lawsuit and enable them to begin collecting their staggering award.\n\nThe election workers' lawyer, Rachel Strickland, raised concerns that, if the bankruptcy continues, many of Giuliani's assets would ultimately go to administrative expenses, not the creditors.\n\n\"The beginning, middle and end of this case has been about my clients and their judgment, to highlight with a bad-faith litigation tactic,\" Strickland said. \"Mr. Giuliani hasn't even pretended to comply with the duties and responsibilities as a debtor in possession. He regards this court as a pause button on his woes while he continues to live his life unbothered by creditors. The case should be dismissed.\"\n\nLess than an hour before the hearing, Giuliani's team agreed with the election workers' proposal.\n\n\"I don't think that's to the benefit of creditors to have the assets go to pay professional fees,\" Gary Fischoff, Giuliani's attorney, said at the hearing.\n\nBut the official creditors committee wants to remain in the bankruptcy system, worried that they'd otherwise be left with nothing. They proposed appointing a bankruptcy trustee who would effectively take control of Giuliani's assets and monitor his finances.\n\nOther members of the creditors committee include the electronic voting machine company Dominion Voting Systems, which Giuliani in 2020 also mired in conspiracy theories, and Noelle Dunphy, a former employee of the ex-mayor who sued him alleging sexual assault, harassment and nonpayment of wages.\n\nPhil Dublin, a lawyer representing the committee, said those other creditors shouldn't be disadvantaged because of Giuliani's tactics.\n\n\"Because of his immoral conduct, his failure to comply with the reporting obligations, his failure to reply with court orders, they shouldn't have to then step back behind the Freeman plaintiffs,\" said Dublin.\n\nThe Justice Department's bankruptcy watchdog, the U.S. Trustee Program, did not take a position on the requests.\n\n\"It's clear that there is no question that cause exists to remove this debtor, Mr. Giuliani, from possession of his assets.

The bankruptcy prevented the election workers from collecting on that judgment, while freezing other lawsuits stemming from Giuliani's work for Trump, the former Republican president, as he sought to overturn his loss in the 2020 election.\n\nLast week, Giuliani asked to convert his personal bankruptcy case into a straightforward liquidation, which would force him to sell nearly all of his assets. One group of creditors asked Lane to appoint a trustee to take over Giuliani's finances and businesses, which could lead to a lengthy and contested bankruptcy liquidation, while another group said Giuliani should be kicked out of bankruptcy altogether. All three options pose significant risks for Giuliani.\n\nRead more: https://www.reuters.com/legal/ex-trump-attorney-giuliani-heads-bankruptcy-reckoning-2024-07-10/", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Giuliani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Plains,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White Plains, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "White Plains, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_New_York_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of New York City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722169", "eventUri": "eng-9722169", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 73, "textEnd": 80}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-07-", "textStart": 17, "textEnd": 24}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Giuliani's claims, which were amplified by his longtime ally and former client Donald Trump, generated a torrent of threats against the women, forcing them to flee their homes.\n\nA dismissal of his bankruptcy case, their attorney argued, would require Giuliani to liquidate his assets -- which include two multimillion-dollar homes -- and immediately begin paying off his debts, including to them.\n\nIn a court filing just prior to Wednesday's hearing, Giuliani said he, too, was seeking dismissal of the case, an outcome that would prevent him from facing the possible appointment of a trustee who would control Giuliani's assets. Giuliani's attorney, Gary Fischoff, suggested that such a step might cause Giuliani, 80, to opt against working and generating income.\n\nThe judge said he intended to issue a final ruling by Friday.\n\nGiuliani, who joined the hearing by phone, grew audibly frustrated at times as Moss and Freeman's attorney Rachel Strickland ticked through a list of his alleged misdeeds. She accused Giuliani of using his bankruptcy proceedings -- initiated just days after the defamation verdict -- to shield himself from financial consequences. He's since repeatedly refused to comply with requirements to disclose details of his income and assets, many of which are obscured in difficult-to-track LLCs.\n\n\"He regards this court as a pause button on his woes while he continues to live his life unbothered by creditors,\" Strickland said. \"If the case is dismissed, creditors will be able to hold America's mayor accountable for the harms he's caused.\"\n\nAs she spoke, Giuliani interjected, calling her comments \"highly defamatory\" and asking to be heard. Lane interrupted the former New York City mayor, saying he was speaking out of turn and threatening to cut off his microphone if he continued to disrupt the proceedings.\n\n\"Sir, everybody gets a chance to be heard,\" Lane said.\n\nThough Giuliani's defamation verdict is by far his largest unpaid debt, he also owes millions of dollars in unpaid legal bills and other costs he's accrued in recent years.

Giuliani's claims, which were amplified by his longtime ally and former client Donald Trump, generated a torrent of threats against the women, forcing them to flee their homes.\n\nA dismissal of his bankruptcy case, their attorney argued, would require Giuliani to liquidate his assets -- which include two multimillion-dollar homes -- and immediately begin paying off his debts, including to them.\n\nIn a court filing just prior to Wednesday's hearing, Giuliani said he, too, was seeking dismissal of the case, an outcome that would prevent him from facing the possible appointment of a trustee who would control Giuliani's assets. Giuliani's attorney, Gary Fischoff, suggested that such a step might cause Giuliani, 80, to opt against working and generating income.\n\nThe judge said he intended to issue a final ruling by Friday.\n\nGiuliani, who joined the hearing by phone, grew audibly frustrated at times as Moss and Freeman's attorney Rachel Strickland ticked through a list of his alleged misdeeds. She accused Giuliani of using his bankruptcy proceedings -- initiated just days after the defamation verdict -- to shield himself from financial consequences. He's since repeatedly refused to comply with requirements to disclose details of his income and assets, many of which are obscured in difficult-to-track LLCs.\n\n\"He regards this court as a pause button on his woes while he continues to live his life unbothered by creditors,\" Strickland said. \"If the case is dismissed, creditors will be able to hold America's mayor accountable for the harms he's caused.\"\n\nAs she spoke, Giuliani interjected, calling her comments \"highly defamatory\" and asking to be heard. Lane interrupted the former New York City mayor, saying he was speaking out of turn and threatening to cut off his microphone if he continued to disrupt the proceedings.\n\n\"Sir, everybody gets a chance to be heard,\" Lane said.\n\nThough Giuliani's defamation verdict is by far his largest unpaid debt, he also owes millions of dollars in unpaid legal bills and other costs he's accrued in recent years. A committee representing all of his creditors urged Lane not to dismiss the case but instead to appoint a monitor to run Giuliani's finances.\n\nPhilip Dublin, an attorney representing the committee, said that if the case were dismissed, Freeman and Moss would likely reap the benefits of Giuliani's asset sales while other creditors might be out of luck.\n\nBut Strickland countered that Giuliani's continued and repeated defamation of the two women -- which continued even after his defamation verdict -- were required by law to take precedence over his other unpaid debts.

Giuliani, former lawyer to Donald Trump, filed for bankruptcy after being ordered to pay $148 million to election workers he falsely accused in 2020. Legal challenges loom for Giuliani.\n\nU.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane indicated on Wednesday that he would likely end Rudy Giuliani's bankruptcy, a decision that would pave the way for defamation, sexual harassment, and other lawsuits to proceed against Donald Trump's former attorney.\n\nSpeaking at a court hearing in White Plains, New York, Lane said he would rule on Friday concerning requests from Giuliani and his creditors on the bankruptcy's future. The 80-year-old Giuliani filed for bankruptcy in December after being ordered to pay $148 million to two Georgia election workers he falsely accused of vote-rigging in the 2020 election, won by Joe Biden. The bankruptcy has since frozen further lawsuits tied to Giuliani's work for Trump in challenging the 2020 election outcome.\n\nLast week, Giuliani sought to convert his bankruptcy into a straightforward liquidation, necessitating the sale of nearly all his assets.

What if the court just dismissed his bankruptcy outright?\n\nIt was the start of an exciting morning, in which Giuliani busted through the Zoom like the Kool-Aid man to shout that the lawyer for Atlanta poll workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss was defaming him. He appeared to see no irony in declaring bankruptcy to get out from under a $148 million defamation verdict, and then turning around an accusing his victims of \"highly defamatory\" statements. (Leave aside the litigation privilege and, uh, literally every other thing.)\n\nAs in the Alex Jones case, the hearing before US Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane laid bare the competing interests of the creditors, who include \"the Freeman plaintiffs,\" Dominion Voting Systems, and Giuliani's former assistant Noelle Dunphy. The latter two have pending lawsuits, while the prior has an enforceable judgment for many times the value of Giuliani's assets. They're not all going to get the money, and so the ones with perfected claims would like to attach all his assets now.\n\nThe creditors committee has argued that the case should remain as a Chapter 11, while the Freeman plaintiffs urge the court to boot Rudy entirely. But that would leave nothing for Dominion, whose defamation suit is still in discovery, or for Dunphy, who is suing Giuliani in state court for assault and various labor violations. Of course those parties would prefer that the court retain jurisdiction and adjudicate their claims while a Chapter 11 trustee babysits the debtor to ensure he doesn't loot the estate.\n\nThe hearing kicked off with a statement from Giuliani's lawyer Heath Berger, who said that his client now agrees with the Freeman plaintiffs that the case should be dismissed. He insisted that the creditors would be better off pursuing their \"state remedies,\" rather than frittering away the entire estate on administrative fees. He also made the unsubtle suggestion that, if a trustee were appointed, his client would simply refuse to work at all.\n\nNext up was Rachel Strickland of Wilkie Farr for the Freeman plaintiffs, who opened by acknowledging the reality that Giuliani filed for bankruptcy just a week after the Freeman/Moss verdict in a blatant attempt to stave off collections pending appeal without having to post a multi-million dollar supersedeas bond.\n\nGiuliani \"regards this court as a pause button,\" she argued, calling the bankruptcy \"a bad faith litigation tactic\" with which the debtor \"hasn't even pretended to comply.\" She warned that, if allowed to remain in bankruptcy, he'd continue his dilatory, deceptive filings, forcing the trustee to expend tremendous effort to find the money he's squirreling away in his various businesses -- something he's acknowledged in his own pleadings. She evoked the specter of Judge Lane being forced to adjudicate the messy personal claims in Dunphy's lawsuit: \"The pleadings literally cite his Viagra usage. Your honor doesn't want this case here.\" And finally she warned that Giuliani's continued refusal to comply with his disclosure requirements was going to result in something worse than fines.\n\n\"Unless your honor wants to entertain putting America's Mayor in prison ... I suggest you dismiss,\" she said, twisting the knife.\n\nIt was then that the debtor began shouting about defamation and demanding to be heard by the court. Judge Lane promised he'd get his turn, and suggested that perhaps he'd like to take a break to confer with his counsel.\n\nOn behalf of the creditors' committee, Akin Gump's Phil Dublin urged the court to keep the case in Chapter 11 and appoint a trustee. Warning of a \"race to the courthouse,\" he predicted that cutting Rudy loose would inevitably lead to the Freeman plaintiffs getting it all, leaving nothing for anyone else.\n\nBut on rebuttal, Strickland suggested that Rudy's continued defamation during the pendency of the bankruptcy counts as an administrative expense against the estate, so, under the absolute priority rule, the Freeman plaintiffs are going get paid first anyway. And furthermore, the administrative expenses of bankruptcy -- where the forensic consultant employed to track down Rudy's earnings has already racked up $400,000 in bills -- mean \"administrative claims will eat the corpus if this is done as a pure garage sale\" under the aegis of the court.\n\nIn an unintentionally hilarious moment, Rudy's lawyer Gary Fischoff pronounced himself \"aghast\" at this number. He then proceeded to express his client's indignation that anyone would suggest he had or would fraudulently hide assets from the court and his creditors. Sadly, listeners did not get the chance to hear his client express such indignation himself.\n\nAt the end of the hearing, Judge Lane said he was inclined to dismiss and would issue his ruling from the bench at 1pm on Friday. That should leave plenty of time for the Freeman plaintiffs to file writs of attachment on Giuliani's condos in Florida and New York before close of business.", "source": {"uri": "abovethelaw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Above the Law"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liz_dye@abovethelaw.com", "name": "Liz Dye", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Giuliani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trustee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trustee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_Voting_Systems", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dominion Voting Systems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_7,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Jones", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alex Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_bankruptcy_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States bankruptcy court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debtor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Debtor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersedeas_bond", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supersedeas bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bad faith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleading", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pleading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writ_of_attachment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Writ of attachment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229684330.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722169", "eventUri": "eng-9722169", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

In 2020, as attorney for ex-President Donald Trump, Giuliani falsely accused the mother and daughter of adding ballots for President Joe Biden.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, upon filing for bankruptcy, Giuliani listed nearly $153 million in debts, including close to $1 million in tax liabilities and substantial amounts in potential lawsuit judgments. He estimated his assets at $1 million to $10 million. Recent financial disclosures revealed he had about $94,000 in cash and his company, Giuliani Communications, had approximately $237,000 in the bank. His primary income source recently has been a retirement account, which saw significant withdrawals.\n\nOn Wednesday, during a hearing in the bankruptcy case, Lane, who plans to issue a decision by week's end, said he was leaning toward dismissal.\n\n\"I'm leaning toward dismissal, frankly, because I'm concerned that the past is prologue,\" Lane said in a hybrid in-person and Zoom status hearing in White Plains, New York.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Giuliani's spokesperson via email for comment on Wednesday.\n\nIf dismissed, it would halt Giuliani's pursuit of bankruptcy protection, ending his bid to absolve his debts, as creditors could seek alternative legal methods to reclaim their money, such as court orders, to seize his properties.\n\nFreeman and Moss could also resume their collection efforts on the $148 million judgment in the original court they won their lawsuit in Washington, D.C., avoiding additional bankruptcy court fees. In addition, Lane said that a dismissal would include a 12-month ban on Giuliani reapplying for bankruptcy protection.\n\nDuring Wednesday's hearing, lawyers for Giuliani and his biggest creditors Freeman and Moss agreed dismissal was the best way forward.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Giuliani's lawyer, Gary Fischoff, supported the dismissal, arguing it would allow Giuliani to appeal the defamation case.\n\nLawyer Rachel Strickland, representing Freeman and Moss, in her address to the court, said she was not opposed to Giuliani having his bankruptcy dismissed if it meant that creditors could recover.\n\nHowever, Strickland previously accused Giuliani of exploiting the bankruptcy process as a \"bad-faith litigation tactic,\" asserting he views the court as a \"pause button on his woes.\"\n\n\"The question here is always going to be the cat-and-mouse game of what dollar can be funneled outside of the estate,\" Strickland said. \"Out in the real world, outside of bankruptcy, all dollars are fair game for everyone, and Mr. Giuliani has to continue to live and do whatever it is he is able to do with his name, likeness, and commentary in order to make a living.\"\n\nIn a statement emailed to Newsweek, Strickland said Freeman and Moss are looking forward to the chance to \"execute on their judgment.\"\n\n\"Ruby and Shaye have been waiting patiently for Giuliani to have consequences for his horrific actions. As it looks like he will no longer be able to hide out in bankruptcy, that day is coming soon. We look forward to being able to promptly execute on their judgment,\" Strickland said.\n\nLane's comments come after Giuliani earlier this month requested converting the case to Chapter 7 liquidation, involving a trustee to control and sell his assets to pay creditors.\n\nLane denied the request, saying it would not serve the best interests of those to whom the former Trump lawyer is indebted.\n\nFreeman and Moss also have a pending request to declare that the $148 million judgment cannot be discharged during Giuliani's bankruptcy.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "natalie_venegas@newsweek.com", "name": "Natalie Venegas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Giuliani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_bankruptcy_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States bankruptcy court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_liability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legal liability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_New_York_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of New York City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Plains,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White Plains, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "White Plains, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_7,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trustee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trustee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2425838/rudy-giuliani.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=fc63346edd058c77a497d3177000bf96", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722169", "eventUri": "eng-9722169", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 458346653, "relevance": 2}

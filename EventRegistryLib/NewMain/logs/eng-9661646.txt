Alvaro Morata, Fabian Ruiz and Dani Carvajal were on target for Spain in their Group B opener, as Barcelona youngster Lamine Yamal became the youngest player in the history of the men's Euros when he made his starting appearance aged 16 years and 338 days.\n\nItaly also recorded a win in their opening game, although their 2-1 victory over Albania was not quite as convincing. Nedim Bajrami had put Albania ahead after just 23 seconds, before Alessandro Bastoni and Nicolo Barella struck twice in five minutes to give Italy a lead they held on to for the rest of the match.\n\nBoth Italy and Spain, who are meeting at a fifth consecutive Euros, are among the favourites to come through what was described as the 'group of death' but the game between the two could decide who will finish top.\n\nFollow all the action from the match in our live blog below\n\nSpain have made made one change from the 3-0 win over Croatia, with Aymeric Laporte replacing Nacho in defence. They are unchanged elsewhere.\n\nSpain XI: Simon; Carvajal, Le Normand, Laporte, Cucurella; Pedri, Rodri, Ruiz; Yamal, Morata, Williams.\n\nThe reigning champions have endured a mostly torrid time since the last Euros, but looked impressive for large chunks of their 2-1 win over Albania, despite conceding that disastrous early goal. They remain short of an elite goalscorer, but Lorenzo Pellegrini and Federico Chiesa can make up the difference from the wide forward roles.\n\nAn exciting new generation of Spanish players is showing itself at these Euros, primarily through the talents of Atletico's Nico Williams and Barcelona's Lamine Yamal - the 16-year-old Yamal is already one of Barca's best players and looked bright in an opening 3-0 win over Croatia. Spain looked open at times and allowed Croatia 16 shots - a better opponent would surely have capitalised - but it was a convincing scoreline nonetheless and their clash with Italy will be fascinating.\n\nFive years and one tournament on, at Euro 2020, Italy earned further revenge against Spain with a semi-final victory on penalties following a thrilling 1-1 draw at Wembley.\n\nFederico Chiesa scored a stunning goal on the counter-attack to give Italy the lead but Spain found a deserved equaliser as Alvaro Morata came off the bench to force extra time.\n\nItaly, though, found a way to win and Gianluigi Donnarumma was the hero in the shoot-out as he saved from Morata and Jorginho rolled in the winner.\n\nItaly would go on to do the same against England in the final as they become European champions for the first time.\n\nItaly's revenge, and a masterclass from Antonio Conte. Spain lost a knockout game for the first time in 10 years as Italy executed Conte's gameplan to perfection and the holders were eliminated following a 2-0 defeat in Saint-Denis in the Euro 2016 last-16.\n\nConte's wing-back system and tactics saw the Azzurri dominate, with Giorgio Chiellini scrambling in the opener before Italy fell back onto their defence and Graziano Pelle sealed victory in injury time. Italy went on to lost to Germany on penalties in the quarter-finals.\n\nAfter a 1-1 draw in the group stage of Euro 2012, Spain and Italy met again in the Kyiv final. Spain crowned a golden era with a dominant 4-0 victory, with goals from David Silva, Jordi Alba, Fernando Torres and Juan Mata.\n\n\"We had the perfect game,\" said Andres Iniesta. We dominated, moved the ball quickly, and created lots of chances. I think it's one of the national team's greatest games.\"\n\nSpain's quarter-final victory over Italy proved a seminal moment for their golden generation, leading to European Championship titles in 2008 and 2012 and the 2010 World Cup.\n\nLa Roja had lost three penalty shoot-outs in Euro quarter-finals before meeting Italy, then world champions following the 2006 World Cup, in Vienna on 22 June 2008.\n\nAfter a 0-0 draw in extra time, goalkeeper Iker Casillas saved three penalties in the shoot-out as Spain broke new ground. They didn't look back.\n\n16:10 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nSpain and Italy are meeting at a fifth European Championship in a row at Euro 2024 as an iconic football rivalry gets another new chapter in Germany.\n\nThis is the most-played fixture in European Championship history and will be their eighth clash in the history of the tournament.\n\nGames between Spain and Italy have tended to be tight, low-scoring affairs, with one obvious exception.\n\nWhile Italy have two wins and four games have finished as a draw or gone to penalties, Spain achieved what was close to perfection with a 4-0 victory against in the Euro 2012 final.\n\nKlaus Gjasula struck five minutes into stoppage time to rescue a 2-2 draw for Albania against Croatia in a thriller in Hamburg and keep alive their hopes of reaching the Euro 2024 knockout stages.\n\nThe 2022 World Cup semi-finalists looked to have secured a fine comeback win after Andrej Kramaric scored in the 74th minute to cancel out Qazim Laci's early goal for Albania, then midfielder Gjasula inadvertently turned the ball past his own goalkeeper two minutes later.\n\nBut with time almost up, Albania attacked down the left and the ball was crossed to Gjasula who fired left footed into the corner to stun Croatia and set up a tense finale to Group B. After both sides lost their opening matches of the tournament, only final-game victories over Spain and Italy will likely be enough to see either qualify.\n\nMeanwhile, a win for either Spain or Italy would secure their place in the last-16.\n\nKlaus Gjasula goes from zero to hero in dramatic Albania draw with Croatia\n\nItaly were wobbling, their crown teetering on the edge as the Westfalenstadion exploded and the drums pounded in their ears. Albania stunned Italy with the fastest goal in Euros history, coming after just 23 seconds, as Federico Dimarco left his throw-in short, Alessandro Bastoni melted into the ground, and then, before anyone could understand what was happening, Nedim Bajrami thumped a strike inside Gianluigi Donnarumma's near post. Bajrami raced away, falling into the embrace of a stadium losing its head.\n\nItaly trudged back to halfway and in that moment it seemed the latest twist in the cycle of turmoil that has followed the Azzurri since they defeated England on penalties to win the Euros.\n\nBut what followed was a different story, one not of Albania resistance, but of Italy discovering themselves again.\n\nReport from Dortmund\n\nItaly recover from 23 seconds of madness to find themselves again\n\nA new Spain, in more ways than one. As Lamine Yamal, who was not even a year old when they won Euro 2008, became first the youngest footballer to play in a European Championships and then, before half-time, the youngest to set up a goal in one, Luis de la Fuente's side made a break with the past.\n\nWith less possession and more potency, Spain looked like a team trying to cast off the influence of their champion sides. They had 47 per cent of the ball but scored three goals. After going out of successive World Cups in knockout games where they attempted over 1,000 passes each, but seemed to show precious little interest in scoring, this was Spain, but not as we knew them.\n\nRichard Jolly's report from Berlin\n\nLamine Yamal dazzles as face of new Spain to validate overdue change\n\n14:20 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nAs Luciano Spalletti prepares for the biggest challenge of his first year in charge of Italy, the 65-year-old is relishing the occasion of facing the highest exponents of his philosophy in Spain. The grandest rivalry in European Championship history will take a new twist at Euro 2024, as Gelsenkirchen stages the first heavyweight clash of a tournament that has so far been defined by the unfancied nations seizing their opportunity. Spalletti knows his Italy side remain a work in progress if they are to reach the levels of possession once set by Spain, who themselves represent something different from what has come before.\n\nPreview ahead of Spain vs Italy\n\nSpain and Italy's reverse culture clash brings new chapter to classic Euros rivalry\n\n14:06 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nLuis de la Fuente's impressive Spain side will take on competition holders Italy in the first meeting of two continental giants at Euro 2024. The match is a replay of the Euro 2020 semi-final, in which the Azzurri won 6-5 on penalties after a 1-1 draw.\n\nLa Roja produced a brilliant display to dismantle Croatia on their way to a 3-0 win in their opening group game. 16-year-old Lamine Yamal grabbed the headlines, with Alvaro Morata and Fabian Ruiz also on the scoresheet to give Spain the lead in Group B.\n\nItaly recovered from conceding the quickest goal in European Championship history against Albania, with Alessandro Bastoni and Nicolo Barella completing a rapid turnaround to give Luciano Spalletti's side an unconvincing 2-1 win. Those results have set up a crunch match at the top of Group B, with either side likely to top the group if they can find a winner in Gelsenkirchen on Thursday.\n\nHere's everything you need to know ahead of the Group B fixture:\n\nSpain v Italy TV channel, start time and how to watch Euro 2024 fixture tonight\n\nSpain: Simon; Carvajal, Nacho, Le Normand, Cucurella; Pedri, Rodri, Ruiz; Yamal, Morata, Williams.\n\nItaly: Donnarumma; Di Lorenzo, Bastoni, Calafiori, Dimarco; Frattesi, Jorginho, Barella; Chiesa, Scamacca, Pellegrini.\n\nThe Azzurri have no fresh injuries either, and a lack of depth means it is likely that Luciano Spalletti will start the same eleven that narrowly beat Albania.\n\nThe Italian defence seems set in stone, and there is little alternative to the quality of Barella and Jorginho in midfield. Italy were pedestrian at times in attack against Albania, though Federico Chiesa was impressive and will surely keep his place on the wing. Gianluca Scamacca remains the biggest goal threat, with none of the five subs making a notable impact last week.\n\nThere are no new injury concerns for Spain, despite both Rodri and Morata coming off in the win against Croatia. Given how the team performed, it is unlikely that Luis de la Fuente will opt for any changes to the starting eleven.\n\nSubstitutes including Olmo, Oyarzabal and Torres did not produce enough during their cameos to suggest they earned a place in the starting line-up. If there was one area to experiment in, it may be the defence, with Bundesliga-winner Alejandro Grimaldo a viable, more attacking option in place of Chelsea's Marc Cucurella at left-back. Both Nico Williams and Alvaro Morata did enough to keep their places in the eleven, though Oyarzabal and Joselu will be lurking.\n\nThe match will kick off at 8pm BST on Thursday 20 June at the Arena AufSchalke in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nWhat TV channel is it on?\n\nSpain vs Italy will be shown live on ITV and ITVX, with coverage starting at 7.15pm.

Spain vs Italy is a classic game, it could very easily be the final. They have great players, a great coach, and a real football culture. They're one of the great national teams. I'm sure it'll be a great show and a great game. It will be a contest worthy of this competition. We'll do our best to win it.\"\n\nAlso, Luciano Spalletti, Italy coach said: \"When you play a EURO, all games are finals, all games are unique, all games are something to remember. We want to play the same kind of football we played against Albania and measure ourselves against one of the strongest teams in Europe. I'm sure that if we leave the ball to them, it will end badly for us. So we will have to take the initiative and see if we manage to do so against such great opponents.\"\n\nThe match will be broadcast on GOtv and DStv.

Ready for everything,\" Spain manager Luis de la Fuente told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nSpain has won the European championship three times (1964, 2008, 2012) and Italy is a two-time winner (1968, 2020) and this is the fifth consecutive Euros that the two teams have met.\n\nStay tuned Thursday for live updates from the monumental match:\n\nItaly vs. Spain underway: Donnarumma makes big save early\n\nItaly goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma was called on less than two minutes into the match, making a point-blank save on Pedri's header, which came on a pinpoint Nico Williams cross from the end line.\n\nDonnarumma was named best player of the tournament at Euro 2020, leading Italy to the title.\n\nSpain vs. Italy lineups\n\nSpain: Unai Simon; Dani Carvajal, Robin Le Normand, Aymeric Laporte, Marc Cucurella; Fabian Ruiz, Rodri, Pedri; Lamine Yamal, Alvaro Morata (c), Nico Williams\n\nItaly: Gianluigi Donnarumma (c); Giovanni Di Lorenzo, Alessandro Bastoni, Riccardo Calafiori, Federico Dimarco; Jorginho, Nicolo Barella; Federico Chiesa, Davide Frattesi, Lorenzo Pellegrini; Gianluca Scamacca\n\nSpain vs. Italy team news\n\nSpain centre half Aymeric Laporte will make his first appearance at Euro 2024 against defending champions Italy on Thursday, replacing Nacho in the starting team for the Group B game.\n\nLaporte was the only change for Spain manager Luis de la Fuente, who kept faith with left back Marc Cucurella while midfielder Rodri and captain Alvaro Morata start after being substituted during Saturday's win over Croatia due to minor injuries.\n\nItaly are unchanged from their 2-1 win over Albania with Gianluca Scamacca leading the attack and a back four including 22-year-old Riccardo Calafiori alongside Alessandro Bastoni.\n\nThe winners will advance to the round of 16 at the top of Group B. Croatia and Albania have one point apiece after two games.\n\nWith a faster, more direct approach than the possession-based \"tiki-taka\" style that made them European champions in 2008 and 2012 as well as World Cup winners in 2010, Spain manager Luis de la Fuente believes the 2024 versions of both teams are very similar in the way they play.\n\n\"We are much alike, they are also a team that are still under development, with a lot of young players and a new coach, very competitive in their approach... When I see them it's like looking at ourselves in the mirror,\" De la Fuente said.\n\n\"They are a team on the rise with a very good collective mindset. It will be a very balanced match between two traditional sides. It's a football classic, a clash that could easily be a Euro or World Cup final.\"\n\nThursday's Spain vs. Italy match will air on FOX at 3 p.m. ET and stream on FoxSports.com and Fubo.\n\nEngland vs. Denmark highlights: Frustrating draw for Three Lions\n\nEngland missed the chance to book its place in the knockout stage of Euro 2024 after they were held to a 1-1 draw against Denmark in Group C on Thursday.\n\nEngland took the lead in the 18th minute after the rapidly advancing Kyle Walker caught Danish defender Victor Kristiansen ambling towards the ball and the full back's low deflected cross into the box fell to captain Harry Kane who slotted it in. However, Gareth Southgate's side failed to press home their advantage, and a sloppy throw-in 16 minutes later came to Morten Hjulmand who had time and space to smash the ball low and in off the post from long range.\n\nEuro 2020 runners-up England had been touted as tournament favorites yet struggled to fashion decent chances throughout the match. They remain on top of Group C on four points, while Denmark are second on two after Slovenia's 1-1 draw with Serbia earlier.\n\n- Reuters\n\nEuro Spain vs. Italy: 'Most important match' of group stage\n\nDefending champions Italy may have won their Euro 2024 opener against Albania with an unexpectedly attacking style of football, but Spain - their opponents on Thursday - are unfazed, says manager Luis de la Fuente.\n\nHe made it clear his side are not preparing for a game of finesse, however, and are getting ready for something more akin to a pitched battle.\n\n\"We are prepared to get muddy, to dig deep in a quarry and for a day in the office. Ready for everything,\" De la Fuente told a press conference on Wednesday.\n\n\"We know what kind of football they play and how competitive they are, so we won't be surprised. I expect a strong, aggressive Italy who will try to control possession. It is the most important match in the group stage.\"\n\nThursday's match will be played at the Arena AufSchalke in Gelsenkirchen, the home stadium for German club FC Schalke 04.", "source": {"uri":

The run began with a 2-0 win over Spain in 2016, their last defeat in the competition was eight years ago against the Republic of Ireland.\n\nItaly have lost just one of their last 10 matches against Spain.\n\nThe Italians no longer parade the star-studded cast they are known for but they can still call on few experienced players like Jorginho, Chielsa and Scamacca.\n\nThe winner of the tie will book a place in the next round with six points and a potential opportunity to top the group.\n\nSpain vs Italy: What The Coaches Said\n\nSpain coach, Luis de la Fuente revealed that the team is hungry for more success despite their impressive win over Croatia.\n\nHe said: \"[The Croatia win] was a complete performance inspired by the competitive genes which run through this team, both the young guys and the experienced ones who've won almost everything in football but are still super hungry and committed. I want to emphasise the attitude, generosity and ambition of this team: they are unquenchable traits.\"\n\nItaly coach, Luciano Spalletti is looking forward to the mammoth clash between the two rivals.\n\nLuciano Spalletti, Italy coach said, \"I've been through some important games but this is right up there. This is one of those matches that could give the players a tale to tell in the future. Spain have got everything, absolutely everything. They always do things in the same way, and we need to more reactive. I'm curious to see what happens when they press with 11 men, how we respond to that.\"\n\nThis is the 11th clash between both teams at a major tournament, with eight coming in the Euros and three World Cup clashes.\n\nItaly have only lost one of their 10 matches against Spain in the Euros and World Cup (W4 D5) - that single defeat came in the final at Euro 2012.\n\nSpain have won the last two matches between both sides in the Nations League.\n\nSpain vs Italy Team News:\n\nRodri and Alvaro Morata will be available for selection after taking part in full training on Wednesday following

Both teams aim to secure a place in the knockout stage with another win.\n\nSpain started strong with a 3-0 victory over Croatia in Berlin. Fabian Ruiz starred by assisting Alvaro Morata and scoring a goal himself. Sixteen-year-old Lamine Yamal also impressed, setting up Dani Carvajal for the third goal. Spain's confident start puts them in a good position as they face Italy.\n\nItaly, the reigning champions, had a tougher start but managed to overcome Albania 2-1 in Dortmund. Nicolo Barella and Alessandro Bastoni scored for the Azzurri. Despite conceding early, Italy controlled the game with 67% possession, thanks to Barella and Jorginho.\n\nSpain and Italy have a recent history of intense matches, with Italy beating Spain in the last two Euros. However, Spain's impressive opening performance sets the stage for a highly anticipated clash in Gelsenkirchen. Both teams will look to secure early qualification to the next round.\n\nMORE: Who will win Euro 2024 Golden Boot? Prediction, odds, favorites and expert tips for top goal scorer award\n\nAustralia's sole broadcaster for Euro 2024 is Optus Sport, meaning this match will be shown on the streaming platform.\n\nIf Spain vs. Italy is not available to watch live in your location, or if you're traveling abroad, you can use a Virtual Private Network (VPN). VPNs offer a secure and private online connection, allowing you to bypass geographical restrictions to access your favourite streaming services from any device anywhere in the world.\n\nWATCH FROM ANYWHERE: Sign up for NordVPN (30-day moneyback guarantee)\n\nThis Euro 2024 match kicks off from the VELTINS-Arena on June 20 at 9:00 p.m. local time in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nHere's how that time translates across all of the time zones in Australia:\n\nSpain will have both Rodri and Alvaro Morata available for their match against Italy, having fully recovered from fitness concerns after their win over Croatia.\n\nAymeric Laporte, who missed the opening game, could return to the bench. Nacho and Robin Le Normand are likely to continue as the central defenders. Dani Olmo and Alex Grimaldo are contenders for starting positions, but few changes are expected from coach Luis de la Fuente.\n\nSpain projected starting lineup: (4-3-3, right to left): Simon (GK) -- Carvajal, Le Normand, Nacho, Cucurella -- Pedri, Rodri, Ruiz -- Lamine Yamal, Morata, Williams.\n\nItaly projected starting lineup: (4-2-3-1, right to left): Donnarumma (GK) -- Di Lorenzo, Bastoni, Calafiori, Dimarco -- Jorginho, Barella -- Frattesi, Pellegrini, Chiesa -- Scamacca.\n\nSpain and Italy are no strangers to each other, meeting for the fifth straight Euros and also clashing in the Nations League recently.\n\nSpain's diverse attacking approach, which worked well against Croatia, might give them the edge over Italy, whose defense has shown some vulnerability. This could lead to La Roja securing a spot in the last 16.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Spain leads Group B ahead of Italy on goal difference after both teams won their opening games. Croatia and Albania are the other teams in the group. Kickoff is at 9 p.m. local (1900 GMT) in Gelsenkirchen. Here's what to know about the match:\n\nMatch facts\n\n-- Italy survived a scare against Albania when Nedim Bajrami scored after 23 seconds - the fastest goal in Euros history. A 2-1 come from behind win avoided embarrassment for Luciano Spalletti's team.\n\n-- There were no such concerns for Spain after a dominant 3-0 win against World Cup semifinalist Croatia.\n\n-- Italy beat Spain on penalties in the semifinals of the last Euros after a 1-1 draw through extra time at Wembley Stadium. The team, then coached by Roberto Mancini, also needed penalties to beat England in the final.\n\n-- Build up to the last game in Gelsenkirchen - Serbia vs. England - had been overshadowed by concerns about fan violence. Eight people were temporarily detained following a brawl between fans. There has been less focus on potential security issues ahead of this game.\n\nTeam news\n\n-- Spain defender Aymeric Laporte has resumed training with the squad following a muscular issue.\n\n-- Italian media has speculated about Spalletti making changes ahead of the Spain game and the potential for Gianluca Mancini and Bryan Cristante to be brought into his starting line up.\n\nBy the numbers\n\n-- This is this the fifth Euros in a row that Spain and Italy have met, with two wins each going into Thursday's match.\n\n-- With 46% of possession against Croatia, Spain failed to dominate the ball for the first time in 136 competitive games.\n\n-- Italy is going for a record-equalling third European Championship title. Spain and Germany have also won three titles. Italy could also become only the second team to win back-to-back Euros after Spain in 2008 and 2012\n\n-- At 16 years, 338 days, Spain's Lamine Yamal became the youngest player to appear at a European Championship in his team's 3-0 win over Croatia.\n\nWhat they're saying\n\n\"Right now Spain, are better than us in terms of individual players. We will have to bring the Italian spirit into play; we will need to struggle together.\" - Italy midfielder Davide Frattesi.\n\n\"I remember a friendly against Portugal before the last Euro and there was a part of the fanbase who weren't happy and whistled us.... Now we, the media and the fans all share a lot of pride and ambition in what we're doing. We're all rowing in the same direction.\" - Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon.", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winnipeg Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelsenkirchen", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nedim_Bajrami", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nedim Bajrami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciano_Spalletti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luciano Spalletti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianluca_Mancini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gianluca Mancini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Cristante", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Cristante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aymeric_Laporte", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aymeric Laporte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Mancini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roberto Mancini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davide_Frattesi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Davide Frattesi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/11/fb-og-image.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661646", "eventUri": "eng-9661646", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

First, though, they must make sure of progress to the knockout phase.\n\nSpain European Championship form:\n\nW\n\nSpain form (all competitions):\n\nWLDWWW\n\nItaly European Championship form:\n\nW\n\nItaly form (all competitions):\n\nDWWDWW\n\nTeam News\n\nAssuaging concerns about their fitness following last week's win over Croatia, both Rodri and Alvaro Morata have taken part in full training and will be available on Thursday, when Aymeric Laporte could make his return from injury.\n\nThe France-born defender missed Spain's opening match entirely but may now take a place on the bench, with Nacho and Robin Le Normand continuing in the centre of La Roja's back four.\n\nFew changes - if any - are expected to Luis de la Fuente's lineup, though Dani Olmo and Alex Grimaldo front a long queue for promotion to the starting XI.\n\nMeanwhile, Italy can also name an unaltered side in Gelsenkirchen, as all of their players were available for training following the victory over Albania.\n\nLuciano Spalletti has claimed he is not tied down to a particular formation, but some personnel changes would indicate a more cautious approach: Gianluca Mancini offers a more conservative centre-back option than forward-raiding Riccardo Calafiori; Bryan Cristante could replace Roma teammate Lorenzo Pellegrini to tighten up the Azzurri's midfield.\n\nOne man certain to start is Nicolo Barella, who has now posted five goal involvements from his last seven international appearances, but Genoa striker Mateo Retegui is pushing to displace Gianluca Scamacca up front.\n\nSpain possible starting lineup:\n\nSimon; Carvajal, Le Normand, Nacho, Cucurella; Pedri, Rodri, Ruiz; Yamal, Morata, Williams\n\nItaly possible starting lineup:\n\nDonnarumma; Di Lorenzo, Bastoni, Calafiori, Dimarco; Jorginho, Barella; Frattesi, Pellegrini, Chiesa; Scamacca\n\nWe say: Spain 2-1 Italy\n\nNow meeting for the fifth straight Euros, these nations have been familiar foes in the Nations League too, and Spain's run of success over the Azzurri could continue.\n\nA more diverse attacking approach paid dividends against Croatia, while Italy's defence remains a little dubious, so it may be La Roja celebrating safe passage to the last 16.\n\nFor data analysis of the most likely results, scorelines and more for this match please click here.\n\nbody check tags ::\n\nPreviews

'We are turning the national team into a team that have many faces.'Photograph: Kind courtesy Selecci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola Masculina de F\u00fatbol/X\n\nWhen Italy and Spain meet in Gelsenkirchen on Thursday, they will write a new chapter in what has developed into the most intense head-to-head rivalry in European Championship history.\n\nNo two countries have met more often at Euro tournaments than the Azzurri and La Furia Roja -- the Red Fury -- who will line up against one another for the eighth time since 1960.\n\nIt will also be the fifth edition in a row that the two heavyweights have met head to head at a European Championship.\n\nThat remarkable run began in 2008, when eventual winners Spain beat Italy in a quarter-final, and it actually spans six matches: they met twice in the 2012 tournament including the final that year, which was also won by Spain.\n\nOver much of the country's sporting history, Spain's fans looked enviously across the Mediterranean Sea as Italy racked up four World Cup titles and the Azzurri battled for European supremacy with the mighty Germans.\n\n\"The never-ending torrent of some the best centre halves in history always gave them the upper hand, a rock which Spain smashed into time and again,\" journalist Javier de Paz Fernandez wrote in El Confidencial, a Spanish news website.\n\nBut of the three Euro crowns won by the two countries over the last four tournaments, two have gone to Spain, underscoring their rise as a soccer superpower that also saw them crowned world champions in 2010.\n\nIn the most recent European Championship showdown, Italy defeated Spain in a nail-biting Euro 2020 semi-final that went to penalties at Wembley.\n\nFederico Chiesa curled a shot past Unai Simon before Alvaro Morata beat Gianluigi Donnarumma from close range to secure a 1-1 draw. Morata and Dani Olmo missed in the shootout, and the Azzurri advanced to the final, beating England also on spot kicks.\n\nIn a last-16 encounter in 2016, Italy were again victorious when defender Giorgio Chiellini scored from close range and Graziano Pelle volleyed home in the dying moments for a 2-0 win.\n\nBut in their most important meeting in all competitions, Spain triumphed in the final of Euro 2012 when Vicente del Bosque's all-conquering team thrashed Italy 4-0 in Kyiv.\n\nDavid Silva started the rout with an angled header from a Cesc Fabregas cross and Jordi Alba made it 2-0. Late goals by substitutes Fernando Torres and Juan Mata earned Spain what remains the biggest win in a European Championship final.\n\nThat Euro title was the second in a row won by Spain who were crowned world champions in between at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.\n\nThe stakes will not be as high in Thursday's Group B game at the Arena AufSchalke. Spain and Italy both won their opening matches against Croatia and Albania respectively and look well placed to advance into the knockout rounds.\n\nIMAGE: Italy's manager Luciano Spalletti has put his own mark on the side since taking over last year. Photograph: Kind courtesy Italian Football Team/X\n\nBut if they finish first and second in the group, they could be on course for another meeting, this time in the final in Berlin on July 14.\n\nBoth sides have shown a different style of football in Germany from what fans typically expect.\n\nSpain thrashed Croatia 3-0 in their opener on Saturday playing a faster, more direct approach than the possession-based \"tiki-taka\" style which saw them crowned European champions in 2008 and 2012 as well as World Cup winners in 2010.\n\nWith their golden generation of pass masters Xavi Hernandez, Andres Iniesta and Xabi Alonso long gone, under new manager Luis de la Fuente, Spain have transitioned to a more flexible approach which is better suited to the young, versatile squad at his disposal.\n\nAgainst an ageing Croatia side, Spain applied a relentless high press combined with quick transitions that seemed to catch their rivals off-guard.\n\n\"We are turning the national team into a team that have many faces,\" De la Fuente told a press conference on Saturday.\n\n\"The other countries no longer know what kind of attack we are going to implement and this is a reason to be very happy because it could put Spain back on the level that is expected from us.\"\n\nWith doubt surrounding the status of midfielder Rodri and captain Alvaro Morata after they picked up injuries against Croatia, De la Fuente, 62, has been keeping his cards close to his chest for Thursday's match, closing Spain's practice to the media for two consecutive days.\n\nDefending champions Italy, beaten 4-0 by Spain in the 2012 final, see little point in trying to disguise their intentions.\n\nTasked with restoring belief for fans devastated by their failure to quality for the last two World Cups, manager Luciano Spalletti has put his own mark on the side since taking over last year after winning the Serie A title with Napoli.\n\nSteering clear of Italy's traditional 'defence-first' Catenaccio system, Spalletti has implemented a more attack-minded approach, which they used to great effect in beating Albania 2-1 in their opener.\n\nUnder Spalletti Italy seek to control possession and dominate small areas of the pitch with intense pressure, allowing Nicolo Barella and Lorenzo Pellegrini to service forwards Davide Frattesi and Federico Chiesa on the wings.\n\nIf styles make fights, Thursday's match in Gelsenkirchen should be a cracker.", "source": {"uri": "rediff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rediff.com India Ltd."}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Riccardo Calafiori's own goal settled the match, which could have ended in a much larger win for Luis de la Fuente's side.\n\nLa Roja, seeking revenge for their elimination by Italy in Euro 2020, dominated from the kickoff. Irrepressible young wingers Nico Williams and Lamine Yamal relentlessly drove forward, putting Italy on the back foot in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. Spain had an expected goals (xG) of 1.90 compared to Italy's 0.17. Spain made 20 attempts with nine shots on target, while Italy managed only one shot on target from four attempts. Spain had 28 touches in the opposition box to Italy's 12.\n\nSpain achieved a historic feat by winning three successive matches against Italy for the first time, having beaten them in the 2021 and 2023 Nations League before this encounter. This match also ended Italy's 10-game unbeaten run at the Euros (W7 D3). Spain, who had thrashed Croatia 3-0 on matchday one, have now kept clean sheets in their opening two matches for the second time, the first being in 2016.\n\nNico Williams caused constant problems for Italy with his pace and dribbling. Early on, he provided an inviting cross for Pedri, whose header was tipped over the crossbar by Gianluigi Donnarumma. Williams later missed a header from an Alvaro Morata cross, and Donnarumma denied both Morata and Fabian Ruiz.\n\nSpain's midfielder Rodri was exceptional, making 55 passes in the first half, all completed, and leading with the most line-breaking passes (10). Italy's expected goals of 0.05 in the first half was the second-lowest for any side at Euro 2024, and they managed only three touches in Spain's box.\n\nSpain continued their dominance in the second half. Pedri steered a shot wide off the post, and in the 55th minute, Williams' cross was flicked on by Morata, deflecting off Calafiori and into the net. Despite relentless pressure, including a powerful shot from Morata tipped over by Donnarumma and another effort from Williams hitting the bar, Spain couldn't add to their tally.\n\nSpain will finish top of Group B regardless of the outcome of their last match against Albania on Monday and will face a third-placed side from another group in the round of 16.

La Roja dominated Croatia with a 3-0 win, handing their opponents a joint-heaviest defeat in a major international tournament.\n\nIn contrast, Luciano Spalletti's pre-match comments likely echoed in the ears of his Italian players when Nedim Bajrami scored a stunning goal just 23 seconds in, marking the fastest goal in European Championship history and giving Albania an unexpected lead.\n\nNevertheless, Italy quickly turned the game around with two goals in five minutes from Alessandro Bastoni and Nicol\u00f2 Barella, setting them on a path to potentially become the second team to win consecutive Euros, following in the footsteps of their upcoming opponents.\n\nThe Azzurri's comeback marked their fourth consecutive opening match win in major tournaments (European Championships and World Cups) for the first time in their history, a momentum they aim to carry into their match against Spain.\n\nItaly, traditionally reliant on the experience of Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci, entered Euro 2024 with the sixth-youngest squad, averaging 26.5 years of age.\n\nThere was much scrutiny over Spalletti's squad choices ahead of the tournament, particularly when Italy found themselves trailing early against Albania. However, the youthful energy prevailed, notably embodied by Riccardo Calafiori. Calafiori, a standout in Bologna's Champions League qualification campaign in 2023-24, showcased his talent on the international stage, impressing in only his third appearance for his country.\n\nSpain also showcased their young talent at Euro 2024. Lamine Yamal, who made history as the youngest player to feature in any European Championship match, demonstrated his impact. Yamal led in touches inside the opposition box (6), created three chances (joint-most), and provided an assist for Dani Carvajal's maiden international goal.\n\n\u00c1lvaro Morata, assuming captaincy for the first time in a major tournament, has solidified his place as Spain's second-highest goalscorer in major tournaments, trailing only David Villa who has 13 goals.\n\nIn European Championship history, Morata stands among elite company, with only Cristiano Ronaldo and Michel Platini scoring more goals than his seven.\n\nDespite typically dominating possession in their matches, Spain, under Luis de la Fuente's guidance, have adopted a new approach. Against Croatia, they experienced a shift as they had less possession for the first time in 136 competitive matches, dating back to the 2008 Euros final against Germany.\n\nThe upcoming match between Spain and Italy marks their 11th meeting at a major tournament, spanning across 8 European Championships and 3 World Cups, setting a record for encounters between European nations.\n\nThis fixture will also extend their streak to five consecutive European Championships where they have faced each other, dating back to 2008, another record in tournament history.\n\nDespite Italy's strong record against other opponents, they have only lost once in their 10 previous matches against Spain in the Euros and World Cup (winning 4 and drawing 5). That solitary defeat came in the final of Euro 2012.\n\nIn recent years, Spain has enjoyed success against Italy, winning their last two meetings in the Nations League. However, they have never managed to secure three consecutive victories against the Azzurri.\n\nFurthermore, Spain has a perfect record against the reigning champions of the European Championship, having won all three of their previous encounters and reaching the final each time they faced the defending champions.\n\nAlvaro Morata and Rodri are expected to be available for Spain's upcoming match against Italy at Euro 2024.\n\nBoth players suffered minor issues in their previous game but are likely to recover in time for this crucial Group B clash. Another victory for either team would secure a spot in the last-16 with a game to spare.\n\nMorata, who was substituted during the win over Croatia, reassured fans that his departure was due to a minor knock. Meanwhile, concerns over Rodri's fitness were downplayed by coach Luis de la Fuente, who attributed his substitution to fatigue from extensive gameplay.\n\nDe la Fuente emphasized the importance of managing players' conditions optimally for the later stages of the tournament, stating, \"Morata took a knock, and Rodri was fatigued from his efforts. It was a wise decision to make the change to ensure all our players are in top form for the crucial stages of the competition.\"\n\nAymeric Laporte missed the Croatia match due to a muscle issue, and although he is nearing full fitness, Nacho is likely to retain his place in the starting lineup against Italy.\n\nItaly's team news ahead of their match against Spain at Euro 2024 indicates several updates:\n\nNicolo Fagioli, who missed Italy's previous game against Albania due to bruising on his fibula, has returned to training and could be available for selection against Spain.\n\nDespite initial concerns about his fitness, Nicolo Barella started and completed Italy's opening match unharmed, ensuring his presence in midfield for the upcoming fixture.\n\nGianluca Scamacca is expected to retain his position as the striker, despite a subdued performance in the last game. He will likely be supported by Lorenzo Pellegrini and Federico Chiesa on the flanks.\n\nIn the full-back positions, Federico Dimarco and Giovanni Di Lorenzo are likely to continue, while Matteo Darmian might feature from the bench.\n\nItaly appears to have a relatively settled lineup going into their clash with Spain, aiming to build on their initial victory and secure advancement in Group B.\n\nGiven Spain's impressive display against Croatia, where they showed a decisive attacking prowess, particularly with threats from players like Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams on the wings, they enter their match against Italy with confidence.\n\nItaly, despite their own strengths and solid performances historically against Spain in major tournaments, may find themselves challenged by Spain's renewed attacking vigor and pace on the flanks.\n\nConsidering these factors, Spain could be poised to capitalize on their recent form and attacking depth to potentially edge out Italy in what promises to be a tightly contested encounter.\n\nWhen and Where to Watch the Match LIVE in India?\n\nUEFA Euro 2024 matches will be broadcast live on Sony Sports channels: Sony Sports Ten 2, Sony Sports Ten 2 HD, Sony Sports Ten 3, Sony Sports Ten 3 HD, Sony Sports Ten 4, Sony Sports Ten 4 HD, Sony Sports Ten 5, and Sony Sports Ten 5 HD in India.

Williams had been everywhere but still had one more trick: Italy had compromised their gameplan in an attempt to finally subdue the thrilling Spain winger, but Williams carried the spirit of this young team and simply went again as he found the avenue to his left. A moment that had been building since kick-off finally arrived as Williams produced the cross that led to Riccardo Calafiori's own goal. By the end, Spain had battered Italy 1-0.\n\nEven as Luis de la Fuente's side sealed their place in the last-16 with a game to spare, Spain deserved more. For the best part of an hour, they tore the holders Italy apart, led by Williams and his evisceration of Di Lorenzo. Spain really should have found the goals to seal a statement victory such a performance had merited, one of fearlessness that was summed up by irrepressible displays from their young winger Williams, and the even younger 16-year-old Lamine Yamal. Italy, who hung on long enough to threaten a late equaliser, were far from looking like the champions of three years ago.\n\nIn that, Spain earned some revenge for their semi-final defeat at Euro 2020, while looking like a more complete side from that tournament. La Roja are certainly more exciting and have more than matched Germany with their first two performances. But if the hosts have been carried on by their own sense of momentum, Spain are generating theirs. The joyfulness of Williams and Yamal to run and run, terrorising their full-backs, offers Spain considerable energy as well as skill. Spain were alive and electrified, all over the pitch.\n\nThat includes a magnificently committed performance from Marc Cucurella, the Chelsea defender who looked like he would not make the squad a couple of months ago before his club form turned around. The left-back was excellent against Italy's Federico Chiesa, flying into challenges as if his life depended on it, his mane flowing wildly. It meant Italy, despite their ambition before the game to control possession, couldn't gain a foothold. The commanding Gianluigi Donnarumma kept Italy in it with a series of excellent saves but unlike the Wembley penalty shootout victory over Spain, he couldn't be the hero here.\n\nThe meeting of Spain and Italy for a fifth European Championship in a row and the latest chapter of the most played rivalry of the tournament's history brought the biggest night of Euro 2024 so far. If the group stages of the tournament have been defined by the efforts of the unfancied nations seizing their moment, such a Turkey and Georgia taking swings at each other for 90 minutes in the rain in Dortmund, Spain brought a different level of intensity as they met the holders Italy and wiped them off the park for the best part of an hour. It felt a different sport to whatever England were doing in their 1-1 draw with Denmark earlier.\n\nAll that talk before the game about Italy wanting to control possession and Spain accepting they were more dangerous without the ball? Well, old habits die hard. Spain dominated and, from the very start, it was impossible to look away from Williams. The 21-year-old missed the biggest chance of the first half when he headed wide Alvaro Morata's excellent whipped cross at the back post, but Williams kept on going, finding he had the beating of Di Lorenzo inside and out.\n\nOn the other wing, Yamal drew the first ooos from the crowd with an elegant spin, then had everyone on their feet as he lowered his head, steadied for the contact, and then emerged from a bunch of white shirts as if he was floating through the air. A magnificent run fell to the feet of Morata but, from the angle, Donnarumma blocked the shot with his feet. By then, Donnarumma had already tipped over Pedri's header, set up by who else but Williams, before he managed to get the slightest touch on a rising strike hit ferociously by Fabian Ruiz.\n\nIt capped a frantic period where Italy couldn't get out and Spain's breakthrough felt inevitable. Italy made it to half-time having been restricted to one effort on goal and attempted to regroup. With his ambition up in smoke, the head coach Luciano Spalletti made two changes at the break, bringing off Jorginho and Davide Frattesi, sacrificing control in the middle for numbers on the outside - specifically, the side of Williams.\n\nOn came Andrea Cambiaso and Bryan Cristante, the former positioned ahead of the struggling right back. Cambiaso may have looked at the Spain winger's treatment of Di Lorenzo and run onto the pitch with wobbling legs. In any case, Italy failed to shut down the Spain left. Pedri could only steer wide from Cucurella's cut-back moments after the restart, as Italy retreated further and abandoned Spalletti's principles with a series of alarmed, rushed clearances.\n\nThen, finally, the moment came, and to no one's surprise it was Williams again, flying at Di Lorenzo and Cambiaso and beating them both. The ball was flashed across the face of goal and although Spain were missing a forward presence, Williams found an area where it caused panic: his cross took a deflection before a touch from the diving Donnarumma sent it into the knee of Calafiori. The centre-back, who carries a hapless air alongside occasional brilliance, fell to to the ground as it deflected in.\n\nSpain kept flowing forward and, thrillingly, trying new things. Yamal bent a stunning shot inches wide of the bar post, and then Williams attempted the same, crashing a thunderous hit off the crossbar as if Spain's young wingers were in competition with each other.\n\nThe end of the game turned when Yamal and Williams were brought off by De la Fuente, with Spain falling back. Italy survived long enough and suddenly felt as if they were going to get a chance, heads lifting like a rising corpse. A Calafiori header flashed wide but nothing else of substance came, even as Donnarruma went up for a corner at the very last.\n\nIt would have been a robbery had Italy nicked something, and in holding out Spain learned something else too. Often, the most watchable exciting team at the tournament does not win it, and are found to be missing something by the latter stages. But Spain, with this new generation, look like they will be going further than many expected. Like Yamal and Williams, their potential appears to rise with every game.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Will that change today?\n\nTwo storied nations in world football will meet again as Spain takes on Italy at the Veltins-Arena in Gelsenkirchen on Thursday in the group stage of the European Championship.\n\nThis will be their 11th time facing one another at a major tournament and the fifth-consecutive meeting at the Euros since 2008. Thus, there are a ton of interesting storylines to whet our appetite for this matchup.\n\nSpain is a +120 favorite on the three-way moneyline following its 3-0 victory over Croatia in the group opener. However, Italy deserves plenty of respect as the current title holders, and the Azzurri will undoubtedly be buoyed by its head-to-head performances against Spain in this competition.\n\nThe two teams will take the field knowing Albania eked out a 2-2 draw against Croatia with a goal in the 95th minute. That result could significantly affect which teams advance out of Group B.\n\nWith Croatia and Albania already trailing in points and goal differential within the group, Spain and Italy could take a somewhat conservative approach in settling for a point.\n\nOdds via FanDuel\n\nAfter more than a decade of disappointment, Spain ended its trophy drought by winning the 2023 UEFA Nations League. But before that, La Furia Roja had a four-year span (2008-2012) in which it won two European Championships (2008, 2012) in addition to a World Cup (2010).\n\nSpain has a tremendous history in the Euros, tying with Germany for the most wins (three).\n\nDespite having such a dominant result in its opener, Spain had less possession (46.7%-53.3%), fewer shot attempts (11-6) and the same number of shots on goal (5-5).\n\nThe Spaniards jumped all over Croatia with three first-half goals. However, a closer look reveals that Croatia's expected goals (2.19) were actually higher than Spain's (1.83).\n\nThus, Croatia deserved better than the 3-0 shutout, which could make Spain somewhat overvalued in this matchup against Italy.\n\n\" READ MORE: Colombia to win the Copa Am\u00e9rica tournament among the best bets to place before games kick off\n\nThe Azzurri's start to the Euros against Albania didn't go as planned after conceding the fastest goal (23 seconds) in tournament history.\n\nHowever, Italy leveled the game at the 11-minute mark on an Alessandro Bastoni header from the right side of the 6-yard box. Five minutes later, Italy went ahead on a right-footed strike from Nicolo Barella.\n\nItaly dominated the game the rest of the way, as Albania didn't even sniff a second attempt at a goal. The Italians won the possession battle (68.3%-31.7%) and registered 17 shot attempts with five on target. Its expected goals tally of 1.60 was also better than Albania's (0.48).\n\nThe head-to-head numbers are fascinating for this matchup, considering that Spain has won three of the last four meetings. However, Italy has just one loss in its last 10 matches (four wins, five draws) against Spain at major tournaments like the Euros or the World Cup.\n\nMoreover, Spain has won the last two meetings against Italy, but it has never won three consecutive matches in this series.\n\nUnder new manager Luis de la Fuente, Spain could opt to play with less possession than in recent years. Croatia was the first team in 136 competitive matches to see more of the ball against Spain.\n\nBreaking down an Italian defense is never easy, and that task could prove even more challenging if you don't win the possession battle.\n\nTherefore, I'd expect the Azzurri to get a result in this match with either a win or a draw..", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_arinze@inquirer.com", "name": "Michael Arinze", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_AufSchalke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arena AufSchalke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelsenkirchen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Nations_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Nations League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Bastoni", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alessandro Bastoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol\u00f2_Barella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicol\u00f2 Barella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kuk_Sool_Won", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kuk Sool Won", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/GHxTQ7D2AzDdzwFwjRnIQ-CMYa8=/760x507/smart/filters:format(webp)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/pmn/SY3WKT66DJB3DDOFDBRCWMPL7I.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661646", "eventUri": "eng-9661646", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

DraftKings has the Over priced at +130 and the Under at -165, while FanDuel offers similar: Over 2.5 at +136; Under 2.5 at -166. At ESPN Bet, Over 2.5 is listed at +115, with Under 2.5 at -150.\n\nSpain vs. Italy Betting Analysis\n\nItaly got off to a nightmare start in its Euro opener against Albania, as a defensive lapse seconds after the opening whistle allowed the underdogs to score the fastest goal in Euro history (just 23 seconds into the match, to be exact).\n\nBut the Italians quickly responded with two goals of their own inside the first 20 minutes of the match, then shut Albania down the rest of the way for a 2-1 victory.\n\nSpain, on the other hand, controlled its opener against Luka Modric's experienced Croatian side from the jump last Saturday. Entering Euro 2024, the biggest question about new Manager Luis de la Fuente's team was whether it could create and finish scoring chances.\n\nBased on its first 90 minutes of action this summer, Spain appears to have taken massive strides in this department since its last appearance in the spotlight, when it was shut out by Morocco and lost on PKs in the 2022 World Cup round of 16. Spain blitzed Croatia early, with three goals before halftime from Alvaro Morata, Fabian Ruiz and Dani Carvajal.\n\nAll three came via impressive assists (from Ruiz, Pedri and 16-year-old winger Lamine Yamal). It's hard to overstate how encouraging the nature of those goals was for a team that dominated possession two years ago in Qatar but mustered just two goals over its final three matches before bowing out early.\n\nKeys to Spain vs. Italy\n\nCan Spain repeat its offensive success against Italy?\n\nSpain's early dominance of Croatia came against a theoretically solid back line. But after Man City defender Josko Gvardiol and Co. gave up two more goals against Albania on Tuesday, it might be time to re-think whether Croatia is the same quality side that reached the semifinals of the 2022 World Cup.\n\nI digress, but Spain faces a tough Italian keeper (PSG star Gianluigi Donnarumma) and back line on Thursday, and the Italians' defense gets a boost from the fact that four of its starters -- defenders Federico Dimarco and Alessandro Bastoni, plus midfielders Nicolo Barella and Davide Frattesi -- all play together for Inter Milan, which ran away with the '23-24 Serie A title.\n\nCan Italy rediscover its Euro 2020 mojo?\n\nNo team in Europe has had a more up-and-down recent history than the Italians. They failed to qualify for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, but managed to win Euro 2020 (which took place in 2021 due to the pandemic) in between those embarrassments.\n\nThis year's team features plenty of talent in its prime, but after the roller coaster ride that was its opener against Albania, the jury is out on its prospects in a deep field. In addition to loaded favorites England and France, Germany, Portugal, the Netherlands and, yes, Spain, all look like contenders.\n\nSpain vs. Italy Best Bets\n\nIn case the questions above, and the lack of definitive answers to them, didn't give it away, this game strikes me as much more of a toss-up than oddsmakers seem to believe.\n\nI overreacted to both Switzlerand-Hungary and Scotland-Germany when trying to predict Switzerland-Scotland, so I'm trying to avoid that mistake here.\n\n2) Double Chance -- Italy or Draw (available at -160 at both BetMGM and DraftKings). This is another solid option -- at an unfortunately expensive price -- for anyone who isn't quite ready to go all-in on Spain in a tough battle like this one.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com",

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nAs Luciano Spalletti prepares for the biggest challenge of his first year in charge of Italy, the 65-year-old is relishing the occasion of facing the highest exponents of his philosophy in Spain. The grandest rivalry in European Championship history will take a new twist at Euro 2024, as Gelsenkirchen stages the first heavyweight clash of a tournament that has so far been defined by the unfancied nations seizing their opportunity. Spalletti knows his Italy side remain a work in progress if they are to reach the levels of possession once set by Spain, who themselves represent something different from what has come before.\n\nNew faces are attempting to lead respective revolutions. Spain's next generation is being moulded by Luis de la Fuente's pragmatism. An opening victory over Croatia was notable for the fact that they had less possession than their opponents, bringing a run of 136 competitive matches since the Euro 2008 final against Germany to an end. Led by captain Alvaro Morata and the 16-year-old Lamine Yamal, who can further add to his blossoming reputation on the biggest stage against Italy, Spain's greatest weapon is now the counter-attack, rather than trying to pass teams to death.\n\nSpain attempted just 455 passes during the 3-0 win over Croatia, less than half of their total from the existential crisis of a defeat to Morocco in the last 16 in of the 2022 World Cup. If it showed how much has already changed since the days of Luis Enrique, with Serbia, Switzerland and Austria all attempting more passes than Spain in their opening matches, Italy's total was just as instructive. By contrast, no team attempted more passes than Italy in the Azzuri's opening win over Albania in Dortmund.\n\nBut Spalletti, a perfectionist, demanded more. He always does. \"What matters is winning? No, what matters is playing good football,\" Spalletti said after the 2-1 victory over Albania, a night that saw the Azzurri recover from the fastest goal in European Championship history. \"In order to be Italy's head coach, or in order for us, we only have one route to do so - that's via good football,\" he said. \"If you don't play good football, there are teams better than us. If you go and play with the same things the better teams have, they will win.\"\n\nRemarkably, this is the fifth European Championship in a row where they have met. Their clashes often come to assume greater importance on reflection. Spain's victory over Italy in the quarter-finals of Euro 2008 proved a seminal moment for a golden generation, ending the curse of the penalty shootout that had previously loomed over a nation. From there, as world champions, Spain met Italy twice at Euro 2012 and their most significant meeting came in the final. Spain's 4-0 thrashing of the Azzurri was the crowning moment of their era of dominance as they defended their European crown.\n\nBut Italy found a way to frustrate Spain in other ways, forming some of the first dents in their collective belief. Four years on, Italy had revenge. Their 2-0 win in the last 16 of Euro 2016 came from a masterclass of organisation from Antonio Conte. Another tournament on, at Euro 2020, Italy and Spain battled in a high-wire tactical contest before the Azzurri won on penalties to reach the Wembley final. When it came to winning and winning ugly, Italy displayed what was previously always evident against Spain, that they understood how to do it and their opponents did not.\n\nNow for the new era. In Gelsenkirchen, it is Italy who are likely to have more of the ball and it is Spain who are preparing to frustrate with their work off it, a role reversal from previous meetings on this stage. \"We are prepared to get muddy, to dig deep in a quarry and for a day in the office. Ready for everything,\" De la Fuente said. \"We know what kind of football they play and how competitive they are, so we won't be surprised. I expect a strong, aggressive Italy who will try to control possession.\"\n\nSpalletti will demand that too, just as he expects Spain to present the toughest test of his early work with Italy. How will Spalletti's side respond when Spain press them high up the pitch, closing the angles and squeezing the play? If anything, this is what Spalletti's pursuit of perfection has been building towards.

Continue reading to learn all the key pre-match details about the mega brawl on Matchday 2.\n\nUEFA EURO 2024: Spain vs Italy - Where To Watch The Game In US\n\nJose de la Fuente's Spain and Luciano Spalletti's Italy will lock horns at the Veltins Arena on Thursday night. The game will kick off at 9 PM local time (CET) / 3 PM ET / 12 PM PT. EURO 2024 followers in the United States can watch the game live on TV on FOX. They can also stream the match on ViX, Fubo, and Sling TV.\n\nSpain kicked off the proceedings in Group B with a mouth-watering encounter against 2018 FIFA World Cup finalists Croatia on Saturday (June 15). La Roja dominated the game from the first blast of the whistle to the last, claiming a comfortable 3-0 victory. Captain Alvaro Morata opened the scoring for Spain in the 29th minute before Fabian Ruiz (32') and Daniel Carvajal (45+2') put the game to bed.\n\nLater on Saturday, defending European Champions Italy took on Albania. Although they conceded the fastest goal in EURO history through Nedim Bajrami (23 seconds), they regained their composure and bounced back with a 2-1 victory. Alessandro Bastoni (11') and Nicolo Barella (16') were the goalscorers for Azzurri.\n\nTeam News\n\nSpain stars Rodri and Alvaro Morata picked up knocks in the win over Croatia, with neither managing to play the entire game. However, their setbacks seem temporary, meaning De la Fuente should have his first-choice XI back in action on Thursday.\n\nItaly, meanwhile, ended the game against Albania without any scares. So, Spalletti, too, can pick his best XI for the Matchday 2 showdown.\n\nHead-To-Head\n\nSpain and Italy have a storied rivalry, with the two European heavyweights meeting as many as 40 times over the years. Two-time European Champions Spain have the lead in the head-to-head statistics, having claimed 13 wins and suffering 11 defeats. Sixteen games have ended without a victory for either team.\n\nSpain and Italy's last meeting in the competition came in the semifinal of EURO 2020. The game ended 1-1 at the end of 120 minutes, with Italy clinching the victory on penalties.\n\nSpain vs Italy: Prediction\n\nThanks to their superior goal difference, Spain are currently sitting at the top of the Group B rankings. Meanwhile, Italy are second, as Croatia and Albania are level on one point after playing two games. A win for either Spain or Italy will take them to the Round of 16, so they will be eager to take their chances. On the other hand, they will also be cautious not to push too hard, as a defeat would put them under pressure on Matchday 3.\n\nKeeping the permutations and combinations in mind, we are backing the two heavyweights to end up in another stalemate. We believe the match between Spain and Italy will end in a 2-2 draw on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "sportslens.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportslens.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sushan_chakraborty@sportslens.com", "name": "Sushan Chakraborty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sling_TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sling TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_AufSchalke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arena AufSchalke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lvaro_Morata", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lvaro Morata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciano_Spalletti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luciano Spalletti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nedim_Bajrami", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nedim Bajrami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodri_(footballer,_born_1996)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rodri (footballer, born 1996)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Bastoni", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alessandro Bastoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol\u00f2_Barella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicol\u00f2 Barella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Carvajal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dani Carvajal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Ruiz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Ruiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://sportslens.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Spain-vs-Italy.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661646", "eventUri": "eng-9661646", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 152, "textEnd": 159}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-15", "textStart": 833, "textEnd": 840}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

ensured that La Roja would go through as Group B winners.\n\nRiccardo Calafiori's own goal nine minutes after half-time was the difference between the two sides at Gelsenkirchen in the biggest match to date at the tournament in Germany.\n\nBut the slender margin of victory didn't reflect a statement performance from Spain who completely nullified Italy and should have had the game won by

unfortunate Calafiori poked the winning goal into his own net.\n\nLuis de la Fuente's team have a perfect six points at the top of the group and take on Albania on Monday knowing that they are already in the knockout rounds and playing like potential champions.\n\nFor Italy Thursday's deserved defeat was a reality check as vibrant Spain peppered the brilliant Gianliugi Donnarumma's goal throughout the match while the Azzurri failed to have a single attempt on target.\n\nIt was a performance reminiscent of the Euro 2012 final between the two teams when Spain crushed Italy 4-0 in the last international hurrah for tiki-taka football.\n\nHowever all is not lost for Luciano Spalletti's team, who are second on three points, as a draw with Croatia on Monday will be enough to guarantee

Morata's superbly delivered, inswinging ball from the left flank.\n\nSpain were clearly on top as Italy struggled to get out of their half, Gianluca Scamacca toiling on his own up front with little support and wasting possession when it did come his way.\n\nDonnarumma had to be at his best twice within a matter of seconds when he first stuck out a foot to deny Morata and then pulled off a superb fingertip save which kept out Fabian Ruiz's powerful drive from distance.\n\nMeanwhile at the other end of the pitch Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon was a virtual spectator as Italy's sole shot in the first half came just before the break when Federico Chiesa blazed a poor effort over from a difficult position.\n\nThe same pattern of Spanish possession and Italian defending continued after half-time and Pedri again wasted a great chance in the 51st minute, slamming wide after Marc Cucurella pulled back a perfect low cross.\n\nBut Spain got the breakthrough soon after and it came through more sensational play from Williams on the left, who made mincemeat of Di Lorenzo before fizzing across a ball which Calafiori couldn't help but divert into his own goal.\n\nLa Roja went close to doubling their lead with two distance strikes from Morata and teen sensation Lamine Yamal, before the superb Williams smashed an effort past Donnarumma which came crashing out off the crossbar in the 71st minute.\n\nItaly pushed forward in hope of an equaliser after Mattia Zaccagni and Mateo Retegui replaced the ineffective Chiesa and Scamacca.\n\nBut in the dying moments Donnarumma again made two superb saves to twice stop Ayoze Perez making the scoreline better reflect a one-sided contest.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [],

Nacho and Robin Le Normand are likely to continue as the central defenders. Dani Olmo and Alex Grimaldo are contenders for starting positions, but few changes are expected from coach Luis de la Fuente.\n\nSpain projected starting lineup: (4-3-3, right to left): Simon (GK) -- Carvajal, Le Normand, Nacho, Cucurella -- Pedri, Rodri, Ruiz -- Lamine Yamal, Morata, Williams.\n\nItaly projected starting lineup: (4-2-3-1, right to left): Donnarumma (GK) -- Di Lorenzo, Bastoni, Calafiori, Dimarco -- Jorginho, Barella -- Frattesi, Pellegrini, Chiesa -- Scamacca.\n\nSpain and Italy are no strangers to each other, meeting for the fifth straight Euros and also clashing in the Nations League recently.\n\nSpain's diverse attacking approach, which worked well against Croatia, might give them the edge over Italy, whose defense has shown some vulnerability.

Italy defeated Spain 4-2 on penalties in their semifinal match at Euro 2020 and also eliminated them in the round of 16 in 2016. The rivals faced off in every Euro knockout stage since 2008, with Spain winning in the final in 2012 and the quarterfinals in 2008. It is time to continue our Euro 2024 odds series with a Spain-Italy prediction, pick, and how-to-watch.\n\nSpain dominated Croatia in their opening match, scoring three goals in the first half to win 3-0. Fabian Ruiz and Alvaro Morato combined for two in three minutes, while Dani Carvajal volleyed a Lamine Yamal assist to go up 3-0. Yamal is the youngest player in the Euro tournament as a 16-year-old.\n\nItaly got the scare of a lifetime in the game's opening minute when an errant throw-in by Federico Dimarco put the Albanians on the board off a strike from Nedim Bajrami. The Italians had to be having flashbacks of their past two World Cup qualification failures, but the defending Euro champs rallied to win 2-1. Alessandro Bastoni and Nicolo Barella found the scoresheet for Italy.\n\nSpain will try to take advantage of Italy by counterpressing when they lose possession. Italy sits in 22nd for counterattack shots allowed, which could lead Alvaro Morata to plenty of scoring chances. Italy could force Spain into more crosses, which Morata can excel at finishing. Crossing the ball isn't Spain's specialty, though, meaning a solid tactical approach by Luciano Spaletti and his staff could slow Spain's attack.\n\nSpain's high-powered offense could prove too overwhelming for Italy. They don't have the best backline, while Spain had 2.51 expected goals per match and 17.8 shots/90 in qualifying.\n\nWhy Italy Will Win\n\nOne of Spain's biggest weaknesses is their defensive center backs, leaving them prone to giving up goals off crosses and long balls. It will play right into Italy's hands, as they prefer to go over the top and use crosses from the flanks.\n\nItaly's defense is also susceptible to this, but they won't have that problem against Spain. Spain uses a possession-based style of play, like the games we see in La Liga. Italy's weakness is that they rank near the bottom in forward pass completion, long-ball completion, and counterattack shots allowed.\n\nFinal Spain-Italy Prediction & Pick\n\nThe scores of these teams' opening games don't tell the full story. Spain used a quick on-slaught to put Croatia behind, a team that doesn't play well from behind. Meanwhile, Italy dominated the game against Albania in possession and shot attempts. They couldn't extend the lead to win more convincingly, but they have all the pieces to defend their Euro title.\n\nOne issue for Italy is that Gianluca Samacca gives them the best chance at striker, but Luciano Spalletti prefers to play his old striker, Giacoma Raspadori, from his club days. However, that is Spaletti's only downfall, as he is one of the best tactical managers in the tournament and should have a good game plan to defeat the Spaniards.\n\nThe value for Italy is too significant here not to give them a look for the upset victory.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nate_duffett@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Nate Duffett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lvaro_Morata", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lvaro Morata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamine_Yamal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lamine Yamal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Carvajal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dani Carvajal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Ruiz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Ruiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nedim_Bajrami", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nedim Bajrami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Bastoni", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alessandro Bastoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Dimarco", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federico Dimarco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol\u00f2_Barella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicol\u00f2 Barella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciano_Spalletti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luciano Spalletti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Albanians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Raspadori", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giacomo Raspadori"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Spain-vs.-Italy-2024-Euros-prediction-odds-pick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661646", "eventUri": "eng-9661646", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nAs Nico Williams weighed up Giovanni Di Lorenzo in the early moments of the second half on a charged evening in Gelsenkirchen, the Italy defender must have felt as if his night was never going to end. Williams had been everywhere but still had one more trick: Italy had compromised their gameplan in an attempt to finally subdue the thrilling Spain winger, but Williams carried the spirit of this young team and simply went again as he found the avenue to his left. A moment that had been building since kick-off finally arrived as Williams produced the cross that led to Riccardo Calafiori's own goal. By the end, Spain had battered Italy 1-0.\n\nEven as Luis de la Fuente's side sealed their place in the last-16 with a game to spare, Spain deserved more. For the best part of an hour, they tore the holders Italy apart, led by Williams and his evisceration of Di Lorenzo. Spain really should have found the goals to seal a statement victory such a performance had merited, one of fearlessness that was summed up by irrepressible displays from their young winger Williams, and the even younger 16-year-old Lamine Yamal. Italy, who hung on to set up a nervy ending, were far from looking like the champions of three years ago.\n\nIn that, Spain earned some revenge for their semi-final defeat at Euro 2020, while looking like a more complete side from that tournament. La Roja are certainly more exciting and have certainly more than matched Germany with their first two performances. But if the hosts have been carried on by their own sense of momentum, Spain are generating theirs. The fearlessness of Williams and Yamal to run and run, terrorising their full-backs, offers Spain considerable energy as well as skill. Spain were alive and electrified, all over the pitch.\n\nThat includes a magnificently committed performance from Marc Cucurella, the Chelsea defender who looked like he would not make the squad a couple of months ago before his club form turned around. The left-back was excellent against Italy's Federico Chiesa, flying into challenges as if his life depended on it, his mane flowing wildly. It meant Italy, despite their ambition before the game to control possession, couldn't gain a foothold. The commanding Gianluigi Donnarumma kept Italy in it with a series of excellent saves but unlike the Wembley penalty shootout victory over Spain three years ago, he couldn't be the hero.\n\nThe meeting of Spain and Italy for a fifth European Championship in a row and the latest chapter of the most played rivalry of the tournament's history brought the biggest night of Euro 2024 so far. If the group stages of the tournament have been defined by the efforts of the unfancied nations seizing their moment, such a Turkey and Georgia taking swings at each other for 90 minutes in the rain in Dortmund, Spain brought a different level of intensity as they met the holders Italy and wiped them off the park for the best part of an hour.\n\nAll that talk before the game about Italy wanting to control possession and Spain accepting they were more dangerous without the ball? Well, old habits die hard. Spain dominated and, from the very start, it was impossible to look away from Williams. The 21-year-old missed the biggest chance of the first half when he headed wide Alvaro Morata's excellent whipped cross at the back post, but Williams kept on going, finding he had the beating of Di Lorenzo inside and out.\n\nOn the other wing, Yamal drew the first ooos from the crowd with an elegant spin, then had everyone on their feet as he lowered his head, steadied for the contact, and then emerged as if he was floating through the air. A magnificent run fell to the feet of Morara and, from the angle, Donnarumma blocked his shot with his feet. By then, Donnarumma had tipped over Pedri's header, set up by who else but Williams, before he managed to get the slightest touch on a rising strike hit ferociously by Fabian Ruiz.\n\nIt capped a frantic period where Italy couldn't get out and the Spain breakthrough felt inevitable. Italy made it to the break having been restricted to one effort on goal and attempted to regroup. Luciano Spalletti made two changes at the break with his ambition up in smoke, bringing off Jorginho and Davide Frattesi, sacrificing control in the middle for numbers on the outside - specifically, the side of Williams.\n\nOn came Andrea Cambiaso and Bryan Cristante, the former positioned ahead of the struggling Di Lorenzo. Cambiaso may have looked at the Spain winger's treatment of Di Lorenzo and run onto the pitch with wobbling legs. In any case, Italy failed to shut down the Spain left. Pedri could only steer wide from Cucurella's cut-back moments after the restart, as Italy retreated further and abandoned Spalletti's principles with a series of alarmed, rushed clearances.\n\nThen, finally, the moment came, and to no one's surprise it was Williams again, flying at Di Lorenzo and Cambiaso and beating them both. The ball was flashed across the face of goal and although Spain were missing a forward presence, Williams found an area where it caused panic: his cross took a deflection before a touch from the diving Donnarumma sent it into the knee of Calafiori. The centre-back, who carries a hapless air alongside occasional brilliance, fell to to the ground as it deflected in.\n\nSpain kept flowing forward and, thrillingly, trying new things. Yamal bent a stunning shot inches wide of the bar post, and then Williams attempted the same, crashing a thunderous hit off the crossbar as if they were in competition with each other.\n\nThe end of the game turned when Yamal and Williams were brought off, with Spain falling back. Italy survived long enough and suddenly felt as if they were going to get a chance, heads lifting like a rising corpse. A Calafiori header flashed wide but nothing else of substance came, even as Donnarruma went up for a late corner.\n\nIt would have been a robbery had Italy nicked something, and in holding out Spain learned something else too. Often, the most watchable exciting team at the tournament does not win it, and are found to be missing something by the latter stages. But Spain, with this new generation, look like they will be going further than many expected. Like Yamal and Williams, their potential appears to rise with every game.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

All odds are provided by our best-reviewed football betting sites. Odds are subject to change.\n\nFor a long time, Spain were one of the biggest underachievers in international football. Up until 2008, they had only ever won one major trophy - and their sole success came on home soil at Euro 1964.\n\nAround that time, Spanish football was producing an abundance of small, technically gifted footballers. Luis Aragones, a manager renowned for a direct, physical approach, recognised what he had at his disposal and began the shift towards a possession-based style of play.\n\nIt would prove to be transformative. Spain went on to win three tournaments in a row: Euro 2008, the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012. Aragones was the manager for the first triumph, with Spain strengthening the gospel of ball-control-at-all-costs under his successor Vicente del Bosque.\n\nEventually, though, the stars of those victories went past their peak and opponents worked out how to stop Spain. In more recent times, la Roja have been pretty disappointing.\n\nOn occasion they have even descended into self-parody, dominating possession but providing little thrust or cutting edge. At Euro 2016, World Cup 2018 and World Cup 2022, Spain went out in the last 16.\n\nIn their first game at this tournament, though, Spain ripped up the playbook. For the first time since the final of Euro 2008, they had a lesser share of possession than their opponents in a competitive match.\n\nCroatia controlled the ball for 54 percent of the time on Saturday, as Spain demonstrated a willingness to go a little more direct. The result? Luis de la Fuente's side ran out 3-0 winners to take control of Group B.\n\nTo be clear, Spain have not suddenly become a route-one, long-ball side. But in Nico Williams, Dani Olmo and Lamine Yamal, they have several players who thrive in one-versus-one situations and prefer to run at their markers rather than turning back and playing a safe horizontal pass.\n\nWhether or not it helps la Roja get any closer to another piece of silverware remains to be seen. But it is certainly an interesting twist on the usual Spanish dish.\n\nThe winner of Spain vs Italy will be in pole position to finish top of Group B at Euro 2024.\n\nItaly also got off to a winning start, beating Albania 2-1 despite falling behind within 23 seconds. It was a decent first performance from the Azzurri, but this will be a much sterner examination of their credentials.\n\nItaly arrived in Germany with low expectations. They will hope that ultimately works in their favour, but Spain will put them through their paces on Thursday.\n\nDe la Fuente's side should ultimately have too much quality for the defending champions. Man for man, the likely Spain XI is superior to Italy's.\n\nA midfield three of Rodri, Fabian Ruiz and Pedri will help Spain to get control in the centre of the park, especially if Italy stick with the 4-2-3-1 formation we saw against Albania.\n\nAnd as the Croatia match revealed, Spain now have the players to quicken the tempo in the final third.\n\nThis is not a vintage Italy team and this could ultimately be a frustrating night for Luciano Spalletti and co.\n\n\u26bd Tip Spain to win at 23/20 with Betfred \u26bd\n\nSpain's 3-0 victory over Croatia may give the impression that it was a one-sided encounter. In fact, Croatia had more shots and a higher xG.\n\nThat does not mean Spain were not worthy winners. But it does point to the fact that they have up a fair few chances on matchday one.\n\nThat is something that will give Italy confidence ahead of this blockbuster clash in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nThey will look to get the likes of David Frattesi, Lorenzo Pellegrini and Federico Chiesa into pockets of space between the lines, from where they will be able to cause the Spanish defence problems.\n\nIn truth, De la Fuente's charges were fortunate to keep a clean sheet in their first game. They might not be so lucky this time around.\n\n\u26bd Select both teams to score at 16/19 with VBET \u26bd\n\nYamal was the most eye-catching performer in Spain's triumph over Croatia at the weekend. His performance was excellent even before you consider he is just 16 years of age.\n\nYamal registered an assist in the 3-0 win, setting up Dani Carvajal's goal with a delicious cross from the right flank.\n\nSpain's coaches at club and international level have a duty of care given the winger's tender years. It would be a great shame if he was overworked as a teenager and burned out too quickly.\n\nBut De la Fuente will find it difficult to leave Yamal out of the XI after his showing last time out.\n\nThe Barcelona boy is fearless and he will give Italy left-back Federico Dimarco plenty to think about in this one.\n\nWhether it is a goal or another assist, expect Yamal to be heavily involved in Spain's attacking output.\n\n\u26bd Back Lamine Yamal to score or assist at 6/4 with Sky Bet \u26bd\n\nCommercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to talkSPORT. 18+.

dispatch subpar Italy to seal last-16 berth at Euro 2024", "body": "Spain put in an impressive display to claim a narrow 1-0 victory over Italy and seal their place in the last 16 at Euro 2024.\n\nyou have updates\n\nSpain booked their spot in the last 16 of Euro 2024 with a much-deserved 1-0 victory over Italy in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nThe second matchday in Group B pitted the reigning European Champions against a Spain side looking to replicate the Euros success of 2008 and 2012.\n\nThe pattern of the contest was established from the off as Spain launched a relentless onslaught to pepper Italy's goal in the opening 25 minutes.\n\nPedri, Nico Williams, Alvaro Morata and Fabian Ruiz all threatened to break the deadlock in a dominant first period, but Italy ultimately stood firm to scrape through to half-time unscathed.\n\nLa Roja showed no signs of letting up, and their constant pressure ultimately told in the 55th minute when Riccardo Calafiori inadvertently sent the ball into his own net.\n\nA second Spain goal appeared more likely than an Italy equaliser, but Luis de la Fuente's young guns had to settle for just a narrow victory which ensures Spain will participate in the knockout rounds of a fifth consecutive European Championships.\n\nWilliams and co pile pressure on Italy\n\nBuoyed from their dominant 3-0 win over Croatia, Spain threatened to take the lead inside the opening two minutes in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nWilliams neatly worked the space to stand the ball up for Pedri to attack, but the midfielder was unable to his head over the ball, giving Gianluigi Donnarumma the chance to tip over the bar.\n\nWilliams then spurned a glorious opportunity, sending his header wide from Alvaro Morata's inch-perfect delivery from the left flank.\n\nAs the contest moved past the 20-minute mark, Morata found himself in more familiar terrority, receiving the ball in the box before taking one touch too many, allowing Donnarumma to close the angle and make a strong near-post stop.\n\nWith Spain unable to convert the conventional chances, Ruiz took it upon himself to unleash a thunderous long-range strike which required another important intervention from Donnarumma.\n\nItaly boss Luciano Spalletti would have been disappointed by the fact his troops failed to register a single shot on target in the first period, but the only saving grace was that the contest remained goalless at the break.\n\nSpain get deserved breakthrough\n\nIn an attempt to turn the tide, Spalleti turned to his bench at the interval, introducing Roma's Bryan Cristante and Juventus' Andrea Cambiaso.\n\nHowever, those changes failed to have the desired effect as Spain continued to open up the Italian defence, with Pedri arriving in the box to meet Marc Cucurella's neat pullback, only to guide the ball harmlessly wide of Donnarumma's goal.\n\nWith Spain unable to take advantage of their clearcut chances, they were ultimately given a massive helping hand when Calafiori diverted the ball into his own net in the 55th minute.\n\nWilliams drove towards the byline before sending a cross which was met Morata, who forced Donnarumma to parry with his left hand, causing the ball to bounce off the unfortunate Calafiori and into the net.\n\nAfter playing a key role in the opener, Williams nearly put his own name on the scoresheet when he cut inside from the left and unleashed a thunderous strike against Donnarumma's crossbar.\n\nSubstitute Ayoze Perez threatened a couple of times in stoppage time, but Spain was unable to grab a deserved second goal.\n\nAs for Italy, they finished the contest with just one shot on target and very rarely looked like finding a way back into the contest.\n\nMan of the Match - Nico Williams\n\nCucurella, Ruiz and Yamal all have claims to be awarded Man of the Match following their contributions in the statement victory.\n\nHowever, Williams probably just edges out his teammates, especially after he sent in the dangerous cross that led to the decisive goal.\n\nThe Athletic Bilbao winger was a constant threat on the left flank and can count himself unlucky that he did not get his name on the scoresheet.\n\nWhat next for Spain and Italy?\n\nHaving secured top spot in Group B, De la Fuente may be tempted to rotate his squad for Monday's clash with Albania.\n\nIn contrast to La Roja, Italy still have work to do after suffering their first defeat since losing to England in October 2023.\n\nThe Azzurri are currently in second place and two points better off than Albania and their final group-stage opponents Croatia.\n\nbody check tags ::", "source": {"uri": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Both sides have showcased contrasting styles of play in Germany.\n\nReigning European champions Italy will face a tough test in their bid to defend the Europen title. The Italians take on the Spaniards, who are eyeing to add a fourth continental crown to their trophy cabinet following wins in 1964, 2008 and 2012 Euro. They have not lost a single match in 11 competitive games under head coach De la Fuente. The current run is their best since 2017 and their recent results against their opponent Italy in the 'Group of Death' give them an edge.\n\nOn the other hand, Italy got the upper hand over Spain three years ago and overcame them in penalties in the semifinal en route to Euro 2020 glory. After starting the defence of their title in the worst possible fashion against Albania their ultimate ambition is to make sure of progress to the knockout phase.\n\nAymeric Laporte is expected to remain sidelined due to an adductor injury. The other changes expected in de la Fuente's squad are Dani Olmo and Alex Grimaldo getting spots in the starting XI.\n\nMeanwhile, Italy can also alter the squad with the possible inclusion of Gianluca Mancini in place of Riccardo Calafiori and Bryan Cristante is expected to replace teammate Lorenzo Pellegrini to tighten up the midfield against the three-time champions.\n\nBoth Italian favourites Calafiori and Pellegrini are one yellow card away from getting a one-match suspension. Spain midfielder Rodri will miss the next match if he gets booked tonight.\n\nThis will be the 11th time both Spain and Germany will lock horns at a major tournament, across Euros eight and three times in the World Cups, a record between two European nations.\n\nThis will be their fifth consecutive European Championship which is also a record in itself. Italy have lost just one out of their 10 matches against Spain in the Euros and World Cup and the sole defeat came in the final at Euro 2012.\n\nOn the contrary, Spain have had the better of their previous meetings with Italy, winning their last two encounters. La Roja has successfully beaten the Azzurri's in successive UEFA Nations League semi-finals but have never before won three consecutive matches against them.\n\nSpain: Unai Sim\u00f3n; Carvajal, Le Normand, Nacho, Cucurella; Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz, Rodri, Pedri; Yamal, Morata, Williams\n\nItaly: Donnarumma; Di Lorenzo, Bastoni, Calafiori, Dimarco; Jorginho, Barella; Frattesi, Pellegrini, Chiesa;

This, with a respectful nod to the previous 17 games, is the first heavyweight clash of Euro 2024. It's also a familiar one, the sixth meeting between Spain and Italy in the last five European Championships. Usually they cross paths in the knockout stages, which may happen again this year, but tonight is about qualifying with a game to spare and making a statement of tournament-winning intent.\n\nIt's probably a bigger game for the reigning champions Italy, who have a tougher final match (against Croatia) and will be vulnerable if they lose tonight. They started with a 2-1 win over Albania that was both impressive and nervy, while Spain were slightly flattered by their 3-0 win over Croatia. Even so there was plenty to catch the eye, most notably the performance of the astonishing 16-year-old Lamine Yamal.\n\n\"Spain vs Italy is a classic game, it could very easily be the final,\" said the Spain coach Luis de La Fuente. \"They have great players, a great coach, and a real football culture. They're one of the great national teams.\"\n\nAs are Spain after their unprecedented success between 2008 and 2012. A key rite of passage was their penalty shootout victory over Italy, who had been their nemesis at major tournaments, in the quarter-final of Euro 2008.\n\n\"This is one of the most important matches of my career; I've already been through some important games but this is right up there,\" says Luciano Spalletti. \"This is one of those matches that could give the players a tale to tell in the future.\"\n\nKick off 8pm.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rob_smyth@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Rob Smyth", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacho_(footballer,_born_1990)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nacho (footballer, born 1990)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aymeric_Laporte", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aymeric Laporte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelsenkirchen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciano_Spalletti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luciano Spalletti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye_Coordination", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye Coordination", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2024/06/20/TELEMMGLPICT000382624025_17189079551850_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqRR0Le-fWeptT_H9uhz3EbSbuAda84zCFXRj9nHkW_ec.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661646", "eventUri": "eng-9661646", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Remarkably, this is the fifth consecutive edition of this tournament when Italy and Spain have played each other, a run that began in 2008.\n\n\"Nothing important. Morata got a bang, and Rodri was fatigue as he had worked a lot,\" said Spain head coach Luis de la Fuente. \"It was intelligent to ask for the change, as we want all our players in the best condition possible for the final stages of this competition.\"\n\nAymeric Laporte, who missed the opening game, is ready to return but Nacho and Robin Le Normand are likely to continue in the centre of defence. Dani Olmo and Alex Grimaldo are contenders for starting positions, but De la Fuente could stick with his XI from Berlin.\n\nSpain predicted: (4-3-3, right to left): Simon (GK) -- Carvajal, Le Normand, Nacho, Cucurella -- Pedri, Rodri, Ruiz -- Lamine Yamal, Morata, Williams.\n\nItaly predicted (4-2-3-1, right to left): Donnarumma (GK) -- Di Lorenzo, Bastoni, Calafiori, Dimarco -- Jorginho, Barella -- Frattesi, Pellegrini, Chiesa -- Scamacca.\n\nInjured: None\n\nSuspended: None\n\nHere's how to watch this Euro 2024 match across selected areas of the world's major regions:\n\nUSA: Spain vs. Italy from Veltins-Arena will be televised in the United States on Fox, with Spanish-language streaming via ViX.

Find out why our soccer expert belives goals are on the cards on Thursday.\n\nSpain and Italy will seek pole position for Group B of Euro 2024 when these two football powerhouses meet on Thursday.\n\nSpain vanquished Croatia 3-0 to open their campaign with Alvaro Morata once again finding the back of the net. They notched all three goals before halftime and then relied on stout goalkeeping to secure the win.\n\nNow they face off with a familiar foe. Italy have never lost three straight matches to Spain, and are looking for payback after losing consecutive Nations League semi-finals to the Iberian side. They'll be bolstered by their comeback 2-1 win over Albania after an embarrassing start, and the fact they've lost just once to Spain in 10 meetings in the Euros or World Cup.\n\nFind out where my Euro 2024 picks lie in my Spain vs Italy prediction for their Euro 2024 fixture on June 20, 2024.\n\nSpain vs Italy picks, predictions, and betting tips\n\nSpain's 3-0 win over Croatia wasn't as easy or comfortable as the scoreline may indicate. In fact, many La Roja players were likely thanking goalkeeper Unai Simon in the locker room for bailing them out in the second half.\n\nThat's because Croatia registered 1.91 xG after the intermission, outshooting Spain 9-5 in the second half. Simon made three huge saves in the period and five on the day as he denied Croatia even a consolation tally.\n\nItaly's goalkeeper faced no such flurry in his side's 2-1 win over Albania. In fact, Opta says Gigi Donnarumma faced only one shot on goal the entire match.\n\nUnfortunately for him, it came 23 seconds into proceedings as the Azzurri fell behind to the fastest goal in Euro history. While he wasn't credited with a save, replays show he did deny what may have been a late equalizer when he blocked a stoppage-time shot off his side.\n\nBut when Spain rolls in on Thursday, the PSG keeper will be much more involved. Alvaro Morata's goal against Croatia put him second among all Spanish goalscorers at the Euros and moved him to third in the competition's all-time scoring list.\n\nHe will be flanked by Nico Williams and the dynamic youngster Lamine Yamal, who created three chances and had six touches in the box vs Croatia. They'll lead an attack that certainly will generate a higher mark than the 0.50 xG posted by Albania.\n\nBut at the other end, Simon's going to face a higher caliber of attacker as well. No offense to Ante Budimir or Andrej Kramaric, but the Italians will have more dangerous weapons leading their line. Gianluca Scamacca is in solid form and played well despite not scoring against Albania.\n\nNicolo Barella did find the back of the net and is always a threat from midfield, with goals in consecutive matches for the Azzurri. And both Lorenzo Pellegrini and Federico Chiesa are threats to create goals at any time.\n\nThis should be one of the matches of the Euro 2024 group stage, and this tournament has shown that goals are in abundance. Both defenses will be heavily tested, and I expect them both to crack at some point with the attacking talent on display. Look for both teams to score for the fourth straight meeting between these two proud footballing nations.\n\nSpain vs Italy same-game parlay (SGP)\n\nUnai Simon was tested heavily by the Croatian attack, and he came up with five critical saves on the day. He's faced Italy three times in competitive matches, making nine totals saves and at least two in each match.\n\nItaly has posted at least four shots on target in five of their last six competitive matches, and a total of 12 in their last three meetings with Spain. If Simon is locked in again, three saves here should easily be attainable.\n\nOne of the shots he'll face is likely to come off the boot of Nicolo Barella. When Italy counters, as they'll likely do here with Spain getting back to possessing more of the ball, he's often found charging into the box on late runs. But he's also a threat to shoot from midfield at any time, as he showed with his beautiful strike for the winning goal.\n\nBarella has attempted 11 shots in his last eight starts for Italy, with at least one shot in seven of those outings. He's scored in consecutive matches and will be involved in the attack at some point once again.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lvaro_Morata", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lvaro Morata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Nations_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Nations League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unai_Sim\u00f3n", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unai Sim\u00f3n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianluigi_Donnarumma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gianluigi Donnarumma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianluca_Scamacca", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gianluca Scamacca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ante_Budimir", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ante Budimir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Chiesa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federico Chiesa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol\u00f2_Barella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicol\u00f2 Barella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Pellegrini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Pellegrini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/603279c6-09a5-4d0f-b4ea-477e0e54fb59.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661646", "eventUri": "eng-9661646", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-06-", "textStart": 1060, "textEnd": 1067}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Channel, start time and how to watch Euro 2024 fixture online tomorrow", "body": "The match is a replay of the Euro 2020 semi-final, in which the Azzurri won 6-5 on penalties after a 1-1 draw.\n\nLa Roja produced a brilliant display to dismantle Croatia on their way to a 3-0 win in their opening group game. 16-year-old Lamine Yamal grabbed the headlines, with Alvaro Morata and Fabian Ruiz also on the scoresheet to give Spain the lead in Group B.\n\nItaly recovered from conceding the quickest goal in European Championship history against Albania, with Alessandro Bastoni and Nicolo Barella completing a rapid turnaround to give Luciano Spalletti's side an unconvincing 2-1 win.\n\nThose results have set up a crunch match at the top of Group B, with either side likely to top the group if they can find a winner in Gelsenkirchen on Thursday.\n\nHere's everything you need to know ahead of the Group B fixture.\n\nWhen is Denmark v England?\n\nThe match will kick off at 8pm BST on Thursday 20 June at the Arena AufSchalke in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nWhat TV channel is it on?\n\nSpain vs Italy will be shown live on ITV and ITVX, with coverage starting at 7.15pm. You can find a full list of which channel is showing each match here.\n\nIf you're travelling abroad and want to watch major sporting events, you might need a VPN to unblock your streaming app. Our VPN round-up is here to help and includes deals on VPNs in the market. Viewers using a VPN need to make sure that they comply with any local regulations where they are, and also with the terms of their service provider.\n\nWhat is the team news?\n\nThere are no new injury concerns for Spain, despite both Rodri and Morata coming off in the win against Croatia. Given how the team performed, it is unlikely that Luis de la Fuente will opt for any changes to the starting eleven.\n\nSubstitutes including Olmo, Oyarzabal and Torres did not produce enough during their cameos to suggest they earned a place in the starting line-up. If there was one area to experiment in, it may be the defence, with Bundesliga-winner Alejandro Grimaldo a viable, more attacking option in place of Chelsea's Marc Cucurella at left-back. Both Nico Williams and Alvaro Morata did enough to keep their places in the eleven, though Oyarzabal and Joselu will be lurking.\n\nThe Azzurri have no fresh injuries either, and a lack of depth means it is likely that Luciano Spalletti will start the same eleven that narrowly beat Albania.\n\nThe Italian defence seems set in stone, and there is little alternative to the quality of Barella and Jorginho in midfield. Italy were pedestrian at times in attack against Albania, though Federico Chiesa was impressive and will surely keep his place on the wing. Gianluca Scamacca remains the biggest goal threat, with none of the five subs making a notable impact last week.\n\nPredicted line-ups\n\nSpain: Simon; Carvajal, Nacho, Le Normand, Cucurella; Pedri, Rodri, Ruiz; Yamal, Morata, Williams.\n\nItaly: Donnarumma; Di Lorenzo, Bastoni, Calafiori, Dimarco; Frattesi, Jorginho, Barella; Chiesa, Scamacca, Pellegrini.\n\nOn the evidence of the first game, Spain's midfield control and attacking verve should be too much for an Italy side who were at times pedestrian against Albania. Spain's defence were hardly tested in their first match, though Italy's attack was too often ineffective in their opener. Though Bastoni and Calafiori were impressive against Albania, their chances are a sign that Spain will get plenty of opportunities.

The result means Spain are now guaranteed to top Group B after hammering Croatia in their opener.\n\nSpain finish up the group stages against Albania next Monday, with Italy taking on Croatia in their third and potentially final match of Euro 2024.\n\nIt took a little over a minute for Spain to deliver the first punch in the battle of two international giants. Nico Williams' delicious cross to the penalty spot picked out an unmarked Pedri and the Barcelona midfielder's header forced Gianluigi Donnarumma into a smart stop.\n\nSpain were guilty of squandering another glorious opportunity in the tenth minute as they sliced through the reigning European champions. Alvaro Morata was provider on this occasion with a devilish delivery to the far post, but Williams inexplicably sent his header wide from just six yards.\n\nLuis de la Fuente's side continued to bamboozle their opponents as the half wore on, playing almost exclusively inside Italy's final third. However, they couldn't make their advantage count, with Donnarumma standing tall to keep out testing efforts from Morata and Fabian Ruiz.\n\nDespite a dominant first half display in Gelsenkirchen, Spain were unable to find the all-important breakthrough. Their profligacy in the final third meant the match entered the second half finely poised, with Italy in need of significant improvements across the pitch.\n\nSpain continued to overrun Italy after the restart but were once again left ruing their wastefulness. Pedri, who should have opened the scoring early in the first half, was picked out by Marc Cucurella inside the penalty area, but the 21-year-old was unable to sort his feet out as he rifled wide from close range.\n\nHowever, it mattered little three minutes later as La Roja took the lead - even if it wasn't a Spanish name on the scoresheet. Morata's near-post flick was palmed out by Donnarumma, but the ball ricocheted off the leg of Calafiori and trundled into the back of the Italy net for the fifth own goal of the tournament.\n\nItaly showed few signs of netting an undeserved equaliser but with only a goal between the sides, Spain couldn't afford to take their foot off the gas. Williams did his best to establish a two-goal cushion but his powerful strike slammed the crossbar with 20 minutes remaining.\n\nHowever, despite not adding to their lead following several late openings for substitute Ayoze Perez, Spain did manage to hold on under minimal pressure from a disappointing Italy side.\n\nGK: Unai Simon - 6/10 - A passenger for the majority of the game, doing far more work with his feet than with his hands.\n\nRB: Dani Carvajal - 7/10 - Rarely threatened by Italy's wide players and enabled Cucurella to roam down the left flank by tucking in when required.\n\nCB: Robin Le Normand - 6/10 - Took a few blows to the head throughout but they didn't knock him off his stride. Booked for a late challenge on substitute Mattia Zaccagni.\n\nCB: Aymeric Laporte - 7/10 - Despite being an injury concern heading into the clash, the Al Nassr centre-back showed no signs of weakness. Dealt with Gianluca Scamacca effectively.\n\nLB: Marc Cucurella - 8/10 - Played like a man possessed, winning duel after duel up against the misfiring Federico Chiesa. Provided plenty of attacking support down the left-hand side too.\n\nCM: Pedri - 7/10 - Should have put Spain ahead in the early stages of both halves but finishing aside, it was a terrific display from the diminutive magician. Floated across midfield and was always in space as Spain carved open Italy's backline.\n\nCM: Rodri - 8/10 - Composed, elegant and unflappable. Exactly what we have come to expect from Rodri, with the only frustration being that he will miss the clash with Albania due to suspension - not that it matters anymore given Spain have topped Group B.\n\nCM: Fabian Ruiz - 8/10 - A graceful display from the Paris Saint-Germain midfielder, who often provided the key pass in the final third. His wand-like left foot orchestrated many of Spain's attacks.\n\nRW: Lamine Yamal - 8/10 - Yeah, this fella shouldn't be 16. Showcased his quick feet regularly with some neat tricks and flicks, almost curled a beauty beyond Donnarumma from 25 yards out and generally tortured Federico Dimarco on the right flank.\n\nST: Alvaro Morata - 7/10 - Knitted play together neatly when the ball turned over and his near-post header forced Spain's opener.\n\nLW: Nico Williams - 9/10 - Left Giovanni Di Lorenzo chasing shadows with an electric display in Gelsenkirchen. Terrorised the Napoli defender from start to finish and had the crowd purring every time he got his foot on the ball.\n\nSubs not used: Alex Remiro (GK), David Raya (GK), Alejandro Grimaldo, Daniel Vivian, Jesus Navas, Nacho Fernandez, Dani Olmo, Fermin Lopez, Martin Zubimendi, Joselu.\n\nLuis de la Fuente - 8/10 - A truly dominant display from Spain against a well-stacked Italy side. Bodes well for La Roja moving forward after convincing victories in their opening two games.\n\nGK: Gianluigi Donnarumma - 6/10 - Made some important saves to stop Spain from filling their boots. Perhaps could have done better with Spain's goal.\n\nRB: Giovanni Di Lorenzo - 3/10 - A chastening experience for the full-back as Williams drove at him relentlessly. Often had to resort to hauling the winger to the ground, or simply watching him sprint away.\n\nCB: Alessandro Bastoni - 6/10 - Made an important intervention to deny Williams during the first half and didn't put a foot wrong on elsewhere.\n\nCB: Riccardo Calafiori - 6/10 - A largely composed display from the young Bologna defender, who was extremely unfortunate to leave the field with an own goal to his name.\n\nLB: Federico Dimarco - 4/10 - Struggled to cope with Yamal's blistering speed and nimbleness, while failing to provide any danger in the Spain half.\n\nDM: Jorginho - 5/10 - Couldn't offer any control or security in Italy's midfield and was withdrawn for the more physical Bryan Cristante at half-time.\n\nRM: Federico Chiesa - 4/10 - Toothless when he received possession and had no joy up against Cucurella. Surrendered the ball far too easily when supplied by his teammates.\n\nCM: Davide Frattesi - 5/10 - Anonymous throughout a poor first half for Italy, barely managing a kick. Hooked at half-time by Luciano Spalletti.\n\nCM: Nicolo Barella - 6/10 - The best performer in an Italy midfield that was completely dominated by Spain's technicians. At least offered his teammates options when they tried to play out from the back.\n\nLM: Lorenzo Pellegrini - 5/10 - Apart from a few fouls, the Roma man couldn't influence proceedings and was sloppy on the left-hand side.\n\nST: Gianluca Scamacca - 5/10 - Completely isolated in the first half, touching the ball just 12 times. Things didn't improve after the break despite one clever turn on the halfway line.\n\nSUB: Bryan Cristante (46' for Jorginho) - 5/10 - Impressively booked within 20 seconds of coming on - the fastest of any substitute in Euros history.\n\nSUB: Andrea Cambiaso (46' for Frattesi) - 6/10 - Italy were a little better after his introduction, but that's more telling of their first-half display.\n\nSubs not used: Alex Meret (GK), Guglielmo Vicario (GK), Alessandro Buongiorno, Federico Gatti, Gianluca Mancini, Raoul Bellanova, Matteo Darmian, Michael Folorunsho, Nicolo Fagioli, Stephan El Shaarawy.\n\nLuciano Spalletti - 4/10 - He will be bitterly disappointed with his side, who simply couldn't match Spain on or off the ball. They're yet to convince at Euro 2024 and were particularly disappointing going forward.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Indeed, Croatia actually had a higher expected goal tally than Spain in that match.\n\nNor was Italy's narrow victory over Albania quite as nervy as it looks on paper.

We played very well with a high press, which allowed us to get the ball back.\n\n\"But one of the characteristics of Spain is our ability to change approaches and that variety is our strength. We have different qualities, different tactical approaches, and that's an extra difficulty for opponents.\n\n\"If you have players with the speed of Lamine [Yamal] or Nico [Williams] or Ferran [Torres], that gives you something else. And the players know that. I have always tried to communicate that.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Italy boss Luciano Spalletti wasn't best pleased with his team's performance against Albania.\n\nHe said: \"We saw many good things, but they need to actually take us somewhere, otherwise they are pointless.\n\n\"There was the possibility to hurt them several times and we didn't go for it. We prepared the move well, then passed it backwards. We changed our minds too quickly.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_penn@thesun.ie", "name": "Matt Penn", "type": "author",

Morata and Dani Olmo missed in the shoot-out, and the Azzurri advanced to the final, beating England also on spot kicks.\n\nIn a last-16 encounter in 2016, Italy were again victorious when defender Giorgio Chiellini scored from close range and Graziano Pelle volleyed home in the dying moments for a 2-0 win.\n\nBut in their most important meeting in all competitions, Spain triumphed in the final of Euro 2012 when Vicente del Bosque's all-conquering team thrashed Italy 4-0 in Kyiv.\n\nDavid Silva started the rout with an angled header from a Cesc Fabregas cross and Jordi Alba made it 2-0. Late goals by substitutes Fernando Torres and Juan Mata earned Spain what remains the biggest win in a European Championship final.\n\nThat Euro title was the second in a row won by Spain who were crowned world champions in between at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.\n\nThe stakes will not be as high in Thursday's Group B game at the Arena AufSchalke. Spain and Italy both won their opening matches against Croatia and Albania respectively and look well placed to advance into the knockout rounds.\n\nBut if they finish first and second in the group, they could be on course for another meeting, this time in the final in Berlin on July 14.", "source": {"uri": "timeslive.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Times LIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The defensive midfielder believes the Azzurri must play with intensity and focus on their strengths to get the better of Group B leaders La Roja.\n\nGroup B rivals Italy and Spain were both in action on Saturday (June 15), with the former taking on Albania and the latter locking horns with Croatia.\n\nAlbanian attacker Nedim Bajrami scored the fastest goal in the competition's history against Italy, firing his team in front just 23 seconds in. Luciano Spalletti's side, however, did not unravel after going behind so early in the game. They turned the game on its head in the following 15 minutes, courtesy of goals from Alessandro Bastoni and Nicolo Barella. Albania tried to come back into the game, but Italy shut shop to secure a 2-1 win.\n\nSpain, on the other hand, took Croatia to the cleaners in the first Group B fixture. They ran circles around Luka Modric and Co., claiming a comfortable 3-0 victory. Alvaro Morata, Fabian Ruiz, and Dani Carvajal all scored in the first half to put the game to bed.\n\nItaly and Spain are level on three points, but thanks to La Roja's superior goal difference, they are sitting at the top of the table.\n\nOn Thursday night (June 20), Italy and Spain will square off, knowing that the winner will cruise into the last 16 of the competition. Ahead of the game, Jorginho revealed the tactics his team would use to beat the two-time European champions. He told VivoAzzurro (via Football-Italia):\n\n\"We'll need high intensity.\n\n\"Both teams will want to keep possession, and we must base our performance on our strengths, not their weaknesses. The coach wants us to play good football and move the ball.\"\n\nThis will be Spain and Italy's second consecutive meeting in EUROs. They crossed paths in the semi-final of EURO 2020 -- a game Italy won on penalties.\n\nAfter Alvaro Morata missed his spot-kick for Spain, Jorginho took the decisive penalty for Italy. He comfortably beat ex-Spain goalkeeper David De Gea to send the Blues through to the final.", "source": {"uri": "sportslens.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportslens.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sushan_chakraborty@sportslens.com", "name": "Sushan Chakraborty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nedim_Bajrami", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nedim Bajrami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorginho_(footballer,_born_December_1991)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jorginho (footballer, born December 1991)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Bastoni", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alessandro Bastoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol\u00f2_Barella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicol\u00f2 Barella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Carvajal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dani Carvajal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Ruiz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Ruiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Modri\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Modri\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lvaro_Morata", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lvaro Morata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_de_Gea", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David de Gea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://sportslens.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1003644273.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661646", "eventUri": "eng-9661646", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-15", "textStart": 347, "textEnd": 354}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 1301, "textEnd": 1308}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Williams' dribbling especially was causing havoc every time he got on the ball, and everything seemed to be clicking perfectly for his team.\n\nSpain had nine shots -- four on target -- before Italy managed their first effort at goal, a wild effort from Enrico Chiesa just before the break.\n\nThe one-way traffic continued after half-time, and Spain got to 11 efforts at goal without finding the net. Persistence paid off though. when Williams once again drove at right-back Giovanni Di Lorenzo, and they deserved the good fortune which saw slight touches from both Morata and Donnarumma before Calafiori could not help but knock the ball into his own goal.\n\nThe Spanish fans in Gelsenkirchen were loving it, with 'Ole' cheers breaking around the stands. The only slight concern was having so many shots and only scoring once. But with qualification for the next round secured already, De La Fuente and his team were very satisfied with their night's work.\n\nDermot Corrigan\n\nSome will focus on Donnarumma palming Morata's header into a helpless Calafiori's path for Spain's goal. But Italy would have gone behind much earlier if it weren't for their skipper.\n\nAs the team in front of him were run ragged by Williams and Yamal, the 25-year-old kept things dignified. In stoppage time against Albania, his arm-pit denied Rey Manaj an equaliser. Donnarumma celebrated that save as if it were a goal. It clinched a curtain-raising win.\n\nOn Thursday he had far more to do. And but for the goal which Spain were long overdue looking at their expected goals, he offered a reminder why he was named player of the tournament three years ago when Italy were crowned champions.\n\nThe 25-year-old palmed Pedri's early header over the bar. He tipped Fabian's long-ranger behind for a corner and made sure Morata didn't beat him at his near post after Yamal left three Italy players in his wake. Shortly after going behind his strong wrist sent a Morata shot into the heavens.\n\nHis critics will seize on his part in Calafiori's own-goal as they did his uncertainty coming for crosses in PSG's Champions League tie with Barcelona. But without Donnarumma a confidence shaking defeat could have been a humiliating one.\n\nJames Horncastle\n\nThere were battles all over the pitch in Gelsenkirchen, but one particular clash that caught the eye in the first half was between Italy's Jorginho and Spain's Pedri.\n\nIt started in the opening two minutes, as Pedri ghosted into the box after peeling off Jorginho with a simple shimmy to get on the end of cross from Williams to head at goal -- a chance he arguably should have scored from.\n\nItaly initially set up with 4-4-2 structure out of possession, but Pedri was drifting beautifully into pockets of space between Italy's defensive and midfield lines, meaning the Italians switched to a 4-1-4-1 shape off the ball to account for the 21-year-old's runs.\n\nIt was Jorginho whose head was on the swivel, ensuring he was rarely far away he was from Spain's No 20. Pedri would often position himself in the blindspot of Jorginho and another simple shimmy in the first half saw him bear down on goal from a single pass played through midfield as he looked to create once more.\n\nIn return, Pedri would often stand on Jorginho when Italy were building out from the back, ensuring that Luciano Spalletti's side did not have an easy method of working the ball through the centre of the pitch.\n\nThe game of cat and mouse only lasted the opening 45 minutes as Jorginho was taken off at half-time, with Bryan Cristante brought on to provide more of a physical presence and Nicolo Barella dropping into a deeper role -- such was the danger that Pedri imposed upon Italy.\n\nMark Carey\n\nWilliams and Yamal are the two young exciting stars of this new-look Spanish team, and after Barcelona teenager Yamal made his mark against Croatia in the first game, tonight it was the Athletic Bilbao player's turn to shine.\n\nWilliams was into the action straight away, with a run and cross in the opening minutes which almost saw Pedri head Spain in front. Every time he picked up the ball, he went straight at his marker Di Lorenzo, often on the outside to cross, but sometimes cutting in to link with team-mates.\n\nItaly coach Spalletti's half-time changes were about trying to curb his influence, but it did not work. When Williams was double-marked, instead he played in left-back Marc Cucurella on the overlap, leading to another Spain chance.\n\nIt was fitting that yet another run and cross from Williams led to the opening goal, even if there was an element of fortune to how the ball ended up in the net. With a bit more luck he would have ended up on the scoresheet himself, with a first half header flying just wide, and a thumping 20-yard curler rebounding from the woodwork in the second half.\n\nIt was a startling display from the 21-year-old, and if he can keep this form up during the tournament his \u20ac50million release clause will look very tempting, especially to cash-rich Premier League clubs. More displays like this and Spain will also be serious contenders for this Euro trophy.\n\nDermot Corrigan\n\nMuch has been said about Spain's departure from their tiki-taka, death-by-passing approach of tournaments gone by, but when you have the directness and searing pace of Yamal and Williams on either flank, you can understand why.\n\nCompared with their previous major tournament in the 2022 World Cup, Spain offer so much more directness and purpose in their attack with their willingness to take on their man and commit bodies with trickery and skill.\n\nIt was on show again on Thursday evening, as Spain's 24 attempted take-ons against Italy were more than any other game in World Cup 2022 or Euro 2020. This largely consisted of Spain getting the ball wide and crossing into dangerous areas, as they have numerous opportunities to punish Italy via such means.\n\nIt was that method of attack that led to goal with Williams causing more chaos, driving to the byline and crossing dangerously as Italy panicked themselves into an own goal from Riccardo Calafiori.\n\nWilliam's 11 attempted take-ons were not just more than any other player on the night, but no player has registered more than the 21-year-old's tally in a single game in the tournament so far. Couple that with the fearlessness of Yamal on the opposite flank and the confidence of Pedri and Fabian Ruiz to drive forward in central areas, and this Spain side have evolved into a team of take-on titans.\n\nMark Carey\n\nIn the headline match-up in the 'group of death', Spain secured top spot and qualification for the knockouts with this 1-0 win.\n\nThe result leaves the Italians needing a draw against Croatia in their final game to be sure of advancing. A defeat would move Croatia above Italy on four points.\n\nAlbania would also move on to four points if they beat Spain. If Albania and Croatia both finish on four points -- as well as eliminating Italy -- they would have to be separated by overall goal difference in the group, having drawn 2-2 in their match against each other.\n\nThe other side may qualify as a best-placed third-place team.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Italy, meanwhile, had to come back from conceding the earliest goal in Euro history before gritting out the rest of the match with the slim advantage.\n\nSpain has won the last two between the two nations, but Italy triumphed on penalties in the Euro 2020 semifinals en route to the title. The Italians have not beaten Spain outright in regulation, however, since a 2-0 victory at Euro 2016, a run of five straight winless meetings.\n\nThere is, quite simply, a talent disparity between these two sides that should play out on the pitch throughout these 90 minutes. While Italy have a few players like Nicolo Barella who might sniff the Spain side, a combined XI between these two teams would be largely dominated by the favorites.\n\nThey also have the form entering this match, as Spain clobbered a quality Croatia team in their opener while Italy looked vulnerable when pressed by Albania. If Italy can manage to frustrate Spain into submission, and force Rodri into one of his trademark \"the best team didn't win today\" post-match rants, they might have a chance, but that's an uphill battle against this in-form team.\n\nThere's absolutely no reason to suggest this match will end with a deflated score, and the plus odds are a generous gift in today's betting landscape where overs are often devoid of value.\n\nFrom every angle this game looks like it will be full of goals. Starting with the favorites, Spain have scored a combined 13 goals in their last three games, unloading for five against each of their pre-tournament friendly opponents Northern Ireland and Andorra before putting three by a defensively sound Croatia.\n\nSure, Italy have not conceded many goals of late, but they've given up eight in their last four against this very opponent, including multiple goals in three of those. They were pressured hard by Albania in their opener and looked vulnerable, and they have not faced a truly quality attacking since since falling 3-1 to England in Euro qualifying last October.\n\nFinally, Euro 2024 has seen goals flying early and often, as only four of the first 10 matches in this competition have gone under 2.5 goals, a significant amount of overs hitting for international football, which can oftentimes be lacking for goals compared to the club level. Hammer this, it's a massive opportunity.\n\nFew players thrive at the European Championship like Alvaro Morata, who rose to third on the competition's all-time leading goal-scorers list by finding the net in the opener against Croatia, with now seven Euro goals in just 11 career games.\n\nMorata, 31, has bagged a goal in four of his last six Euro games, with that stretch including his team's only goal in the 1-1 draw against Italy in the Euro 2020 semifinals, before seeing his decisive penalty saved by Gianluigi Donnarumma in the eventual shootout.\n\nHe will be itching for revenge, especially after he saw an incredible seven efforts fail to find the back of the net the last time these two teams matched up in the Nations League semifinals, with three of those efforts on target but saved by his nemesis Donnarumma.\n\nThis premier Euro 2024 group stage match between Italy and Spain will be televised in the United States on FOX, which can be found streaming on Fubo who are offering a free trial for new users. The match will also be found on Fox's in-house streaming platform Fox Sports GO, while a Spanish-language broadcast is available on streaming service ViX.\n\nIn Canada, this match will be televised on TSN1, TSN3 and TSN4, plus a French broadcast can be accessed on TVA Sports. Both networks offering live streaming options on their dedicated platforms. Finally, fans can also access matches for Italy, Portugal and Spain on TLN.\n\nIn the UK, Euro 2024 matches are split between ITV and the BBC. This match will be televised by ITV, with streaming on their dedicated platform ITVX.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Spain raced into a 3-0 lead against the 2022 World Cup semi-finalists on Saturday before keeping Zlatko Dalic's side at arm's length in the second period.\n\nLuis de la Fuente's side have evolved considerably from the all-conquering generation of 2008 to 2012, with the latest iteration of La Furia Roja combining technical wizardry with speed and directness in wide areas. Another big test now beckons in the form of the holders.\n\nExpectations weren't so grand for Italy heading into the tournament compared to three years ago and, while their victory over Albania was slender, Luciano Spalletti's fingerprints were all over the Azzurri's performance. The former Napoli boss is starting to build this Italian side in his image and Thursday's contest is bound to be a belter.\n\nSpain were so impressive on Saturday that De la Fuente could name an unchanged team for Thursday's clash against Italy. Victory would then allow the manager to rotate heavily on Matchday 3.\n\nLamine Yamal and Pedri's minutes must be smartly managed, especially given the latter's injury woes since his stellar Euro 2020 campaign.\n\nMarc Cucurella was preferred to Alejandro Grimaldo at left-back against Croatia. Aymeric Laporte is building up his fitness and could earn minutes off the bench.\n\nSpain predicted lineup vs Croatia (4-3-3): Simon; Carvajal, Nacho, Le Normand, Cucurella; Rodri, Pedri, Fabian; Yamal, Morata, Williams.\n\nThere's been speculation in the Italian media of Spalletti making several changes to his XI to mitigate Spain's threat in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nStrong man-marker Gianluca Mancini could come in for Bologna's Riccardo Calafiori at centre-back to duel Spain captain Alvaro Morata. The pair faced off on many occasions while Morata led Juventus' line.\n\nThe steely Bryan Cristante may replace Davide Frattesi or Lorenzo Pellegrini in midfield, while Gianluca Scamacca could drop to the bench in favour of the energetic Mateo Retegui.\n\nItaly predicted lineup vs Spain (4-3-3): Donnarumma; Di Lorenzo, Mancini, Bastoni, Dimarco; Jorginho, Cristante, Barella; Chiesa, Retegui, Pellegrini.\n\nSpain were so impressive against Croatia, but the signs were promising for Italy as well against a tricky Albania side. Thursday's bout has the potential to be the best of the group stages given the quality of both squads and respective styles of the two managers.\n\nSpain's collective cohesion will be tough for the Italians to slow down, although its within the Italians DNA to nullify attacking majesty.

Mediterranean derby", "body": "Two heavyweights of European football step into the ring on Thursday as Spain and Italy aim to secure an early place in Euro 2024's knockout phase.\n\nBoth won their opening Group B fixture, so one more point should prove enough for the reigning champions and their Nations League nemesis to progress.\n\nWhen Spain coach Luis de la Fuente sent his team out at Berlin's Olympiastadion for their Euro 2024 opener, he could hardly have imagined they would return at halftime with a three-goal lead over Croatia.\n\nAlvaro Morata, Fabian Ruiz, and Dani Carvajal all scored before the break, kicking off the campaign with a resounding success.\n\nMorata reached double figures in major tournaments, while Carvajal became the oldest Spanish scorer at a Euro.\n\nFielding the tournament's youngest player, 16-year-old Lamine Yamal, who assisted the third goal, and seeing Unai Simon save a penalty, Spain's composed performance suggests they are strong contenders for the trophy this summer.\n\nWith European titles in 1964, 2008, and 2012, Spain aims for a fourth continental crown.\n\nThey have lost just one of 11 competitive games under de la Fuente, winning the last seven, their best run since 2017.\n\nRecent results against their next opponents in the \"Group of Death\" have been particularly positive.\n\nLa Roja defeated Italy in successive UEFA Nations League semifinals, winning last year's edition.\n\nHowever, they have never won three consecutive matches against their Italian rivals.\n\nWhen the two teams meet in Gelsenkirchen, a point apiece could see both through to the last 16, potentially allowing de la Fuente to rest key players against Albania.\n\nNonetheless, pride will be on the line.\n\nWhile their Iberian rivals have dominated recently, Italy famously overcame Spain on penalties three years ago en route to Euro 2020 glory.\n\nSince losing to La Roja in the Nations League last June, the rejuvenated Azzurri have suffered only one defeat in their last 12 matches, winning eight.\n\nUnder Luciano Spalletti's guidance, they have regained their vigor, recovering from a dip in form under Roberto Mancini.\n\nItaly began their title defense shakily but quickly bounced back in Saturday's Group B clash against Albania to secure maximum points.\n\nSassuolo's Nedim Bajrami set a new Euros record by scoring the fastest goal ever after just 23 seconds.\n\nHowever, Spalletti's team soon equalized through Alessandro Bastoni, and Nicolo Barella put them ahead.\n\nNow unbeaten in 10 European Championship matches, with their last defeat dating back to a 2-0 loss to Spain in 2016, Italy's most recent setback in the competition was eight years ago against the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThough considered outsiders this summer, the Azzurri aim to become only the second team to win consecutive Euros, following Spain.\n\nFirst, they must ensure progress to the knockout phase.\n\nEasing concerns about their fitness after last week's win over Croatia, both Rodri and Alvaro Morata participated in full training and will be available on Thursday, when Aymeric Laporte might return from injury.\n\nThe France-born defender missed Spain's opening match entirely but could now take a spot on the bench, with Nacho and Robin Le Normand likely continuing in the center of La Roja's back four.\n\nFew changes, if any, are expected in Luis de la Fuente's lineup, though Dani Olmo and Alex Grimaldo are strong candidates for promotion to the starting XI.\n\nMeanwhile, Italy can also field an unchanged side in Gelsenkirchen, as all their players were available for training after the victory over Albania.\n\nLuciano Spalletti has stated he isn't committed to a specific formation, but some personnel changes suggest a more cautious approach: Gianluca Mancini offers a more conservative center-back option compared to the forward-raiding Riccardo Calafiori; Bryan Cristante might replace Roma teammate Lorenzo Pellegrini to bolster the Azzurri's midfield.\n\nOne player certain to start is Nicolo Barella, who has five goal involvements in his last seven international appearances.\n\nHowever, Genoa striker Mateo Retegui is pushing to replace Gianluca Scamacca up front.", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Sabah"}, "authors":

Morata and Dani Olmo missed in the shoot-out, and the Azzurri advanced to the final, beating England also on spot kicks.\n\nIn a last-16 encounter in 2016, Italy were again victorious when defender Giorgio Chiellini scored from close range and Graziano Pelle volleyed home in the dying moments for a 2-0 win.\n\nBut in their most important meeting in all competitions, Spain triumphed in the final of Euro 2012 when Vicente del Bosque's all-conquering team thrashed Italy 4-0 in Kyiv.\n\nDavid Silva started the rout with an angled header from a Cesc Fabregas cross and Jordi Alba made it 2-0. Late goals by substitutes Fernando Torres and Juan Mata earned Spain what remains the biggest win in a European Championship final.\n\nThat Euro title was the second consecutive won by Spain who were crowned world champions in between at the 2010 World Cup in SA.\n\nThe stakes will not be as high in Thursday's Group B game at the Arena AufSchalke. Spain and Italy both won their opening matches against Croatia and Albania respectively and look well placed to advance into the knockout rounds.\n\nBut if they finish first and second in the group,

The Spanish were left incensed after being denied a penalty when an elbow from Mauro Tassotti on Luis Enrique was missed in injury time, as La Roja chased an equaliser.\n\nSpain were the dominant force in international football as the noughties became the 2010s, as La Roja won three consecutive major tournaments. The Spaniards' spellbinding brand of football saw them fail to concede a single knockout stage goal across the three tournaments and culminated in a 4-0 thrashing of Italy at Euro 2012.\n\nThe Azzurri had eliminated England and Germany en route to the final but were no match for Spain's pass masters in the decider. David Silva opened the scoring with a header and Jordi Alba doubled the lead before half-time.\n\nJuan Mata and Fernando Torres scored late goals for Spain who recorded the biggest winning margin in a European Championship final.\n\nSpain and Italy were drawn together in qualification for the 2018 World Cup and it was the Spanish who stormed to top spot. Italy were unbeaten in qualifiers for over a decade but were a sorry second-best at the Bernabeu.\n\nIsco scored twice for the hosts in a superb Spanish performance before substitute Alvaro Morata turned in a third from Sergio Ramos' cross after a breakaway late on.\n\nItaly were condemned to the playoffs and lost 1-0 to Sweden over two legs, missing out on the World Cup for the first time since 1958.\n\nSpain were beaten in a semi-final for the first time in their history after a shootout defeat to Italy at Euro 2020.\n\nRoberto Mancini's Italy team had entered the tournament on a long unbeaten run and stretched their run without defeat to 33 games to book a place in the final. Federico Chiesa's curler put the Azzurri in front at Wembley, but Alvaro Morata came off the bench to force extra-time with an equaliser for Spain.\n\nHowever, Morata went from hero to zero in the shootout. The Spanish striker missed his side's fourth kick, allowing Jorginho to step up and seal Italy's place in the decider.\n\nRead - Spain vs Italy - Combined XI ahead of Euro 2024 clash", "source":

Spain and Italy both won their opening matches against Croatia and Albania, respectively, and look well-placed to advance into the knockout rounds.\n\nBut if they finish first and second in the group, they could be on course for another meeting, this time in the final in Berlin on July 14.\n\n*Italy have lost just one match in their last 10 meetings against Spain in Euros and the World Cup (W4 D5). The sole defeat came in the 2012 Euro final.\n\n*For the first time in 136 matches since the 2008 final against Germany, Spain had less possession than their opposition when they won 3-0 against Croatia in their opening fixture.\n\n*This will be the 11th encounter in major events between Spain and Italy - Euros (8) and World Cup (3) - a record between two European sides.\n\n*Alvaro Morata, with 10 goals, became Spain's second-highest goalscorer at major international tournaments (Euros/World Cup combined), behind only David Villa (13). The 31-year-old also netted his seventh goal at the Euros and only Cristiano Ronaldo (14) and Michel Platini (9) have netted more in the competition.\n\n*Morata also scored against Italy in the semi-final of the previous edition.", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mediterranean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelsenkirchen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Chiellini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Giorgio Chiellini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicente_del_Bosque", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vicente del Bosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_AufSchalke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arena AufSchalke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Villa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Villa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lvaro_Morata", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lvaro Morata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Platini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michel Platini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boomerang/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boomerang/Competitions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://tds-images.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2024/06/19/ipiccy_image_-_2024-06-19t205827.402_1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661646", "eventUri": "eng-9661646", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-14", "textStart": 1843, "textEnd": 1850}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Italy Will Be An Indicator Of Where Both Teams Are In Their Rebuilds", "body": "In historical terms, tonight's Spain vs Italy game in Gelsenkirchen isn't one of the biggest fixtures between the two nations, but there's still a lot riding on it.\n\nAfter all, these two have contested European Championship quarter finals, semi finals and finals down the years, not to mention the odd World Cup quarter final to boot. If you think about Spain against Italy the mind races back to Roberto Baggio's 88th minute winner in the US 30 years ago; Mauro Tassotti's brutal elbow on Luis Enrique in the same game; Spain finally banishing their inferiority complex against Italy at Euro 2008; that demolition of a final in Kiev four years later in which Spain ran Cesare Prandelli's worn out side to pieces; the semi final at Wembley three years ago in which Giorgio Chiellini bear-hugged Jordi Alba and tossed him around like Andre the Giant picking up a child before the penalty shootout. This is a tie dripping with history.\n\nThis bout has almost gone under the radar, in some respects. Going into Euro 2024, both teams have been less fancied by pundits and bookmakers than in prior years. There is a recognition that both nations are in a rebuilding phase, with Spain just coming out of the Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Sergio Busquets era. Italy, meanwhile, is still feeling its way in the dark in the aftermath of Roberto Mancini's departure for Saudi Arabia and a defence that is now shorn of Leonardo Bonucci and Chiellini, both of whom have called time on their careers. Most of the attention has been on France, England and to a lesser extent, Portugal as potential winners.\n\nMake no mistake about, both teams aren't as strong as perhaps a decade ago, but there is still plenty of quality. Spain, especially, has a new generation of players who could take the world by storm in the next few years, but a serious crack at Euro 2024 feels like a tournament too soon. Yet in the shape of Lamine Yamal, Nico Williams, Pedri, Martin Zubimendi and Gavi, the Spanish machine is still producing top talent.\n\nHowever, the lack of center-forward is a concern for Luis de la Fuente. Alvaro Morata, a striker Italy know all about having played for Juventus in two different stints, led the line against Croatia and scored. Morata is now captain of La Roja, but doubts have always centered on his temperament at the very highest level, and the lack of a genuine world class striker, like David Villa or Fernando Torres in years gone by, could hinder Spain going forward in Germany.\n\nWhile Spain have at least been considered by pundits in terms of tournament favourites, the same cannot be said for holders Italy. Luciano Spalletti has only been in the job less than a year, but the former Napoli coach is slowly turning Gli Azzurri into a more potent side. By the end of the Mancini era, Italy had stopped scoring goals, and while they aren't exactly raining goals under Spalletti, there has been an uptick. Two goals against Albania should've been four by half time. Yet much like Spain, this tournament is arguably one too soon for Spalletti and many of the current squad, with only 10 players from the title-winning side three years ago making the plane to Germany. Reaching the quarter final would be considered a good showing for the reigning champions, with an eye on actually qualifying for a World Cup again and building towards the US, Mexico and Canada in 2026.\n\nFor decades Italy and Spain were stylistically opposed, yet over the past 10 years they've become more similar. Where once it was Italian pragmatism against Spanish fury, both now want their foot on the ball and retaining possession. Italy have adapted most in this regard, with Mancini's iteration being the most attack-minded side in Azzurri history to ever win a title.\n\nOut of all the big teams, Spain have arguably produced the best display at the tournament thus far, seeing off Croatia with relative ease on Saturday, but this will be their biggest test. They haven't beaten Italy in a major competitive fixture since the Euro 2012 final, despite winning the majority of the friendlies and UEFA Nation League games in between.\n\nThis is considered the game of the group stage in prestige terms, and it'll be a good indicator to both coaches where both teams are in their development, and what needs to be done.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com",

Choose from Lamine Yamal, Rodri, Nico Williams, Fabian Ruiz, even the wasteful Pedri, who spurned two chances on Thursday -- they were all excellent as Spain outplayed Italy for a vital 1-0 victory in Group B at Euro 2024.\n\nBut despite the quality of the talent, and the impressiveness of their performances, none of them claimed a goal as Spain surged clear at the top of the group and booked its place in the knockout bracket.\n\nInstead, it was a familiar \"scorer\" that made the difference between the sides, as \"own goal\" appeared on the stat sheet for the fifth time in the tournament, even with Euro 2024 being only a week old.\n\nThis time the unfortunate player was Riccardo Calafiori, who was powerless to avoid deflecting the ball past goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma in the 55th minute to hand Spain all three points.\n\nWilliams whipped in a cross from the left, Alvaro Morata got a slight touch, just enough to wrong-foot Calafiori, the ball bouncing off him and over the line.\n\nSpain deserved its lead. It had a multitude of chances, with Williams heading wide in the first half and Pedri missing a golden opportunity from close range and then steering a fierce shot straight at Donnarumma.\n\nWilliams, lively throughout, smashed an effort against the crossbar after 70 minutes, with Donnarumma beaten.\n\nWith only a clash against Albania to come, Spain is now an overwhelming favorite to secure top spot in the group and set up a clash with a third-place finisher in the round of 16.\n\nDefending champ Italy now finds itself with a problem. Luciano Spalletti's side was unable to get much going and of the three forwards and three midfielders that started the game, only Nicolo Barella avoided being replaced before the end of it.\n\nA second-half free-kick where Lorenzo Pellegrini curled a weak effort high and wide was indicative of the overall performance, which would have been much worse if not for the fine efforts of Donnarumma.\n\n[Euro 2024 highlights: Spain beats Italy 1-0 to win Group B, advance to knockouts]\n\nItaly now needs to avoid defeat to Croatia next week. In all likelihood, a point should be enough to progress, but more worrying is that the squad has been slow to show the kind of form that won it the title three years ago.\n\nThere are no such issues for Spain, the 2008 and 2012 champ. Head coach Luis De La Fuente is enjoying things and a fresh-faced squad is also having fun, being given the license to use its speed and skill to attacking effect.\n\nThe disappointment of the 2022 World Cup defeat to Morocco feels like a long time ago now.

They started the game with serious intent, though failed to really trouble Gianluigi Donnarumma.\n\nBut they were finally ahead 10 minutes into the second-half when Inaki Williams broke down the wing. He crossed it in with Calfiori caught out by Donnarumma's attempt to parry it away.\n\nItaly struggled to create many clear-cut chances of their own and ultimately, one goal was enough for Spain. Here, Mirror Football looks at the biggest talking points from the match.\n\nRefreshing change of pace\n\nMany people will have watched England's dire draw with Denmark heading into this game. So Spain and Italy's desire to attack and play positive football was a refreshing change of pace.\n\nLa Roja were on top for much of the first-half and did have the better chances. But Italy also carved out opportunities of their own, as they showed the Three Lions how to blend a team of exiciting young talent.\n\nIn truth, the two sides were missing a goalscorer in the form of Harry Kane. Even so, this game felt like two heavyweights going at it and showed England just how much work they have to do.\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY! Who was man of the match in Spain's clash with Italy? Comment below.\n\nSpain cement credentials\n\nSpain's 3-0 win against an aging Croatia side was impressive, but this game against another favourite was a proper statement of intent. They were on top for much of the game, with their attacking outlook causing Italy all sorts of problems.\n\nThere has long been the belief that success at international level should be built on defensive security. And that is something that Spain have also been able to create, with Italy having just one shot in the opening 45 minutes.\n\nThey continued their dominance after the break, with their pressing causing issues for the Italians. Spain will have been grateful for the unfortunate own-goal, though they will hope to be more incisive going forward.\n\nItalian defensive worries\n\nItaly's Euro 2020 win was built on the defensive pairing of Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonnuic. Both those players have now moved on from international football and Italy are struggling in their absence.\n\nThough they held off Spain in the first-half, that was more by luck than anything else. In the second-half, Spaletti's men caused many of their own issues by consistently giving the ball away.\n\nThose concerns only add to the worries created by the nervy win over Albania. While there were positives for Italy, it looks to be a tournament too soon for Spaletti's side.\n\nSpain's perfect blend\n\nWhile Spain have got experience throughout the spine of their team, in Aymeric Laporte, Rodri and Alvaro Morata, this win was built on the backs of their young stars. Nico Williams, Pedri and Lamine Yamal were particularly impressive.\n\nThis mix of youth and experience will stand La Roja in good stead as the tournament goes on. Their energy also kept the Italians under pressure through, meaning there was no respite for their defence.\n\nThat allowed Spain to remain in control of the match despite their slender lead. They looked far more likely to add to their goal than Italy did to equalising, mostly because their wingers had pegged Italy deep.\n\nWilliams sends Liverpool message\n\nNico Williams has emerged as a top target for Liverpool and he sent a message to the Reds with his performance against Italy on Thursday. The winger caused havoc for Italy down his side of the pitch and it was his cross that led to the own-goal.\n\nIf Liverpool push ahead with a move for the youngster, Williams has done enough to show that he would certainly suit the Premier League. He looks set to be a key player for Spain as they look to win this summer's tournament.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Morata and Dani Olmo missed in the shootout, and the Azzurri advanced to the final, beating England also on spot kicks.\n\nIn a last-16 encounter in 2016, Italy were again victorious when defender Giorgio Chiellini scored from close range and Graziano Pelle volleyed home in the dying moments for a 2-0 win.\n\nBut in their most important meeting in all competitions, Spain triumphed in the final of Euro 2012 when Vicente del Bosque's all-conquering team thrashed Italy 4-0 in Kyiv.\n\nDavid Silva started the rout with an angled header from a Cesc Fabregas cross and Jordi Alba made it 2-0. Late goals by substitutes Fernando Torres and Juan Mata earned Spain what remains the biggest win in a European Championship final.\n\nThat Euro title was the second in a row won by Spain who were crowned world champions in between at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.\n\nThe stakes will not be as high in Thursday's Group B game at the Arena AufSchalke. Spain and Italy both won their opening matches against Croatia and Albania respectively and look well placed to advance into the knockout rounds.\n\nBut if they finish first and second in the group, they could be on course for another meeting, this time in the final in Berlin on July 14.\n\n(Reporting by William Schomberg; Editing by Toby Chopra )", "source": {"uri": "zawya.com", "dataType":

Morata and Dani Olmo missed in the shootout, and the Azzurri advanced to the final, beating England also on spot kicks.\n\nIn a last-16 encounter in 2016, Italy were again victorious when defender Giorgio Chiellini scored from close range and Graziano Pelle volleyed home in the dying moments for a 2-0 win.\n\nBut in their most important meeting in all competitions, Spain triumphed in the final of Euro 2012 when Vicente del Bosque's all-conquering team thrashed Italy 4-0 in Kyiv.\n\nDavid Silva started the rout with an angled header from a Cesc Fabregas cross and Jordi Alba made it 2-0. Late goals by substitutes Fernando Torres and Juan Mata earned Spain what remains the biggest win in a European Championship final.\n\nThat Euro title was the second in a row won by Spain who were crowned world champions in between at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.\n\nThe stakes will not be as high in Thursday's Group B game at the Arena AufSchalke. Spain and Italy both won their opening matches against Croatia and Albania respectively and look well placed to advance into the knockout rounds.\n\nBut if they finish first and second in the group, they could be on course for another meeting, this time in the final in Berlin on July 14.", "source": {"uri": "tbsnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Business Standard"}, "authors": [],

Spain, who rolled past Croatia 3-0 in their group-stage opener, captured the crown in Euro 2012 to become the first back-to-back winners in tournament history. Italy are looking to become the second, and they began that mission by edging Albania 2-1 in their first group-stage contest. The Italians got past the Spaniards on penalties in the Euro 2020 semifinals before knocking off England in identical fashion for the title.\n\nKickoff is set for 3 p.m. ET. The Spaniards are +115 favorites (risk $100 to win $115) in the latest Spain vs. Italy odds, while the Italians are +280 underdogs. A 90-minute draw is priced at +210 and the over/under for total goals scored is 2.5. Before locking in any Italy vs. Spain picks, you need to see what proven SportsLine soccer insider Martin Green has to say.\n\nAfter working in the sports betting industry for several years, Green became a professional sports writer and handicapper and has covered the game worldwide. Last year, Green was profitable in multiple areas on his soccer picks, including the Champions League (+3.05 units), FA Cup (+3.07), EFL Cup (+4.47) and Euro 2024 qualifiers (+6.30), among others. He also was solid with his Premier League picks this year, going 30-22-1 (+7.07).\n\nNow, Green has broken down Spain vs. Italy from every angle and has locked in his picks and Euro 2024 predictions. You can head to SportsLine now to see Green's picks. Here are the betting lines and trends for Italy vs. Spain:\n\nSpain vs. Italy money line: Spain +115, Italy +280, Draw +210Spain vs. Italy over/under: 2.5 goalsSpain vs. Italy spread: Spain -0.5 (+110)\n\nSPA: The Spaniards have lost just one of their last 11 meetings with Italy across all competitionsITA: The Italians have allowed only two goals over their last six overall matchesSpain vs. Italy picks: See picks hereWhy you should back Spain\n\nUnder manager Luis de la Fuente, the Spaniards have lost just one of their 11 competitive matches, winning each of the last seven. The team has also gone 10-2-1 in its last 13 overall contests and has defeated Italy 2-1 in each of their last two meetings -- both in the semifinals of the UEFA Nations League (2021, 2023). Spain are riding a four-game unbeaten streak during which they have outscored their opponents 16-4.\n\nWinger Mikel Oyarzabal has recorded four goals during the run, including a hat trick in a 5-0 rout of Andorra in an international friendly on June 5. Midfielders Rodri and Pedri have two goals apiece, with the former registering a brace in a 3-3 draw with Brazil in March and the latter notching one in a 5-1 triumph over Northern Ireland on June 8. Striker Alvaro Morata also converted in that friendly before opening the scoring for Spain in the win against Albania with his 35th goal, tying him for fourth place on the national team's all-time list. See which team to pick here.\n\nWhy you should back Italy\n\nThe Italians are riding a seven-game unbeaten streak across all competitions (5-2-0) and have lost just one of their last 12 (8-3-1). Italy gave up a goal just 23 seconds into their group-stage opener against Albania, but they bounced-back in a major way to secure all three points.\n\nDefender Alessandro Bastoni converted in the 11th minute to forge a deadlock, which midfielder Nicolo Barella broke in the 16th minute. It was the 10th international goal for the 27-year-old Barella, who netted his only goal of Euro 2020 in Italy's 2-1 quarterfinal win against Belgium. Winger Federico Chiesa scored a pair of goals for the Italians during Euro 2024 qualifying and was the only member of the club to convert against Spain prior to the penalty shootout in the Euro 2020 semifinals.

At half-time it was 0-0 but that made little sense. It didn't make much sense it was only 1-0 at full-time. There was one side playing deft, modern football and there was one clinging on. Because that side was Italy, and because of their history and reputation, the thought lingered that perhaps they could somehow see it through. They could not.\n\nThese meetings have become something of a Euros tradition. Spain beat Italy on penalties in the quarter-final in 2008, a game that, given their complex about the Italians, was seen as a pivotal psychological moment in Spain's ascent to winning three tournaments in a row, and since then the nations have met at least once in every Euros. They drew in the group then Spain won 4-0 in the final in 2012, Italy won 2-0 on the day England lost to Iceland in Euro 2016, and then Italy put Spain out on penalties in the semi-final three years ago. Which perhaps justifies the Spanish paranoia about the Italian capacity to defy logic and find a way: Italy had only won one of their previous 11 meetings and yet had somehow eliminated them in each of the past two Euros.\n\nRelated: Spain qualify for last 16 after Riccardo Calafiori's own goal floors Italy\n\nFor Italy, meanwhile, the sense of these games at five successive Euros is of pre-eminence lost - they were the reigning world champions at the time of the quarter-final defeat in Vienna - and then, at least before Thursday, a slow closing of the gap as the Spanish philosophy fell out of fashion; even Spain don't play like Spain these days. Not since the 60s have grand theories been the Italian way; Coverciano continues to produce implausible numbers of first-rate coaches but they tend to be pragmatists rather than ideologues.\n\nIn that regard this was Italy's biggest game since the final of the last Euros, less for the result than for the performance and the opportunity to measure themselves in proper competition against an undisputed member of the elite. Although there have been decent results in the Nations League, notably wins over England, Hungary and the Netherlands, they failed to qualify for the last World Cup and were twice comprehensively beaten by England in the qualifiers for this tournament.\n\nThe second of those defeats, it should be said, came just a couple of months after Luciano Spalletti had stepped in as coach following the resignation of Roberto Mancini and the sense has been of gradual improvement since. But it's one thing to hold Ukraine to a 0-0 draw, to secure qualification or to overcome an early shock to beat Albania in the first group game, quite another to take on Spain.\n\nItaly are, notoriously, slow starters, but that used to mean in tournaments as a whole rather than in every game. Having fallen behind after 23 seconds against Albania, they allowed both Pedri and Nico Williams free headers from six yards out within the first 10 minutes. But that was no aberration; that was just the pattern of the game.\n\nOnce the brain had readjusted after England's 1-1 draw with Denmark to watching two teams who could actually pass a ball, the supremacy of Spain was obvious. Poor Giovanni Di Lorenzo was given a terrible chasing by Williams with Federico Chiesa's attempts to cover just inviting Marc Cucurella forward. It quickly became apparent that for Italy this was about survival.\n\nBut that's not a position with which Italy are unfamiliar. Even against the new, more direct Spain the likelihood was always that they would have less possession. In a sense the start just simplified matters. Dig in, hope Gianluigi Donnarumma could keep making saves and get up quickly after clearances to support Gianluca Scamacca. Even the best can start to lose belief if you can thwart them for long enough.\n\nBut the red waves kept coming after half-time. This was a chastening evening for Italy, a night of chasing and hoping. Somehow they even applied some late pressure with a couple of corners, but they could have taken a hammering. The only good news is that they did, just about, keep the score down so victory over Croatia in the final group game will almost certainly take them through. The result of the quadrennial test was clear, and from an Italian point of view, it wasn't pretty.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"},

They'll be keen for a strong showing against Italy after a disappointing 2022 World Cup campaign that saw them lose to Morocco on penalties in the round of 16.\n\nIn the other second-round game of Group B, Croatia and Albania played out a thrilling 2-2 draw, leaving them both on a point apiece, meaning a draw between Italy and Spain could be enough to take both teams through to the Round of 16.\n\nWriting for La Gazzetta dello Sport, Capello analysed the Group B clash between Spain and Italy, explaining why things are different this time.\n\n\"A great classic, yes, but revisited. Because there is a good chance that yet another chapter in the never-ending challenge between Italy and Spain, staged this evening in Gelsenkirchen, will bear little resemblance to previous meetings.\n\n\"The special effect of the 2024 edition will be verticality: we know how to do it, we have always gone vertical. Spain, on the other hand, have turned in this direction with De La Fuente on the bench.\n\n\"And this is the biggest novelty for the Roja, who over the years had accustomed us to tiki-taka and who in this European Championship have focused on other weapons, as publicly admitted by Morata and his teammates. It'll therefore be a different match, but still a complicated one.\n\n\"Spain are still a very difficult team to play against, one of those teams that make practically everyone suffer. They have quality, both in players and in dribbling, I'm thinking of players like Rodri and Fabian Ruiz.\n\n\"And then there are individuals capable of creating constant danger in the one-on-ones, like Yamal. If we add to all this the speed with which De La Fuente's team can find depth, then we'll have a better idea of what awaits us tonight. And what cards Spalletti and the Azzurri will be able to play.\n\n\"If - as appears to be the case - the Azzurri coach will continue to focus on the same block of players who beat Albania in the opener, he'll give a huge sign of confidence to those men. And conviction, above all, Spalletti believes in these players and is sure that they can still improve a lot.\n\n\"Spain move the ball quickly and look for verticality, this makes them unpredictable in the offensive phase. The weak point is in defence, where not everyone is always on the ball. In general, the 'new' attitude of the Spanish can potentially open more spaces for the Azzurri, provided they recover their positions immediately.\n\n\"De La Fuente's men are very good precisely because they don't give you time to reposition correctly. Italy's defence will have to be protected not only by the filter of Jorginho and Barella, but also by the application of the others, who'll have to track back quickly.\n\n\"We'll need an attentive, compact national team, which'll have to limit to a minimum those 'shenanigans' Spalletti spoke about the other night and exploit their 'trequartisti'.\n\n\"Frattesi and Pellegrini are excellent insertion players, they know how to go well into spaces and have quality in their plays, they can hurt the Spanish defence. As well as Federico Chiesa, our best man in one-on-ones. In the semi-final three years ago, it was he who scored, unlocking the game. I hope he can repeat that.\n\n\"Speaking of one-on-ones, we cannot fail to mention Yamal-Dimarco, the challenge within the challenge on our left flank. How will the 16-year-old from Barcelona be stopped? I honestly don't know how Spalletti will do it...\n\n\"Yamal is a difficult forward to control already for a classic goalscorer, and for Dimarco, a wide player who loves to push above all, the mission will become even more complicated. So, let's reverse the plan and look at what the Inter player can give us when the ball is between his feet: lots, lots.\n\n\"When he gets forward on the flank, Dimarco is a player who gets a 10 on the ratings, after Chiesa he is the Azzurri player who dares and creates the most, crosses, shots, low balls from the back that are venomous.\n\n\"He reminds me of Brehme and, in certain aspects, Roberto Carlos. Dimarco, like the Brazilian, manages to serve interesting balls from almost impossible positions.\n\n\"And we come to the goalscorers. Morata cannot be disputed, he is a complete striker, modern, he works for everyone and scores. A bit like what Scamacca is becoming, the Italian has great vision of the game, knows how to open up the move and is exceptional in his speed of execution.\n\n\"Unfortunately for him, he didn't score against Albania, but he came close several times, this is what leaves a coach calm, because it means that the striker is there and that the goal will come.\n\n\"Scamacca, then, has shown he can shine on big nights, like against Liverpool and Marseille in the splendid ride of his Atalanta in the Europa League: what if with Spain it was one of those nights?\n\n\"Let's hope so, I have faith. In him and in the national team. The draw between Albania and Croatia helps us, beating Spain would increase our conviction, our self-esteem would rise exponentially. And the history of Italy teaches us that when Italy convince themselves of their own capabilities...\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"},

Spain raced into a 3-0 lead against the 2022 World Cup semi-finalists on Saturday before keeping Zlatko Dalic's side at arm's length in the second period.\n\nLuis de la Fuente's side have evolved considerably from the all-conquering generation of 2008 to 2012, with the latest iteration of La Furia Roja combining technical wizardry with speed and directness in wide areas. Another big test now beckons in the form of the holders.\n\nExpectations weren't so grand for Italy heading into the tournament compared to three years ago and, while their victory over Albania was slender, Luciano Spalletti's fingerprints were all over the Azzurri's performance. The former Napoli boss is starting to build this Italian side in his image and Thursday's contest is bound to be a belter.\n\nSpain were so impressive on Saturday that De la Fuente could name an unchanged team for Thursday's clash against Italy. Victory would then allow the manager to rotate heavily on Matchday 3.\n\nLamine Yamal and Pedri's minutes must be smartly managed, especially given the latter's injury woes since his stellar Euro 2020 campaign.\n\nMarc Cucurella was preferred to Alejandro Grimaldo at left-back against Croatia. Aymeric Laporte is building up his fitness and could earn minutes off the bench.\n\nSpain predicted lineup vs Croatia (4-3-3): Simon; Carvajal, Nacho, Le Normand, Cucurella; Rodri, Pedri, Fabian; Yamal, Morata, Williams.\n\nThere's been speculation in the Italian media of Spalletti making several changes to his XI to mitigate Spain's threat in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nItaly predicted lineup vs Spain (4-3-3): Donnarumma; Di Lorenzo, Mancini, Bastoni, Dimarco; Jorginho, Cristante, Barella; Chiesa, Retegui, Pellegrini.\n\nSpain were so impressive against Croatia, but the signs were promising for Italy as well against a tricky Albania side. Thursday's bout has the potential to be the best of the group stages given the quality of both squads and respective styles of the two managers.\n\nSpain's collective cohesion will be tough for the Italians to slow down, although its within the Italians DNA to nullify attacking majesty. Reports suggest Spalletti will alter his team to counter La Roja's guile and craft, perhaps suggesting Italy will be happy to cede control and attack De la Fuente's side in transition.\n\nThis has the makings of a chess match and a draw would set up a thrilling conclusion to Group B.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelsenkirchen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamine_Yamal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lamine Yamal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Cucurella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marc Cucurella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lex_Grimaldo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lex Grimaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciano_Spalletti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luciano Spalletti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S.C._Napoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.S.C.

The Group B encounter was defined by tense moments and missed opportunities before a crucial own goal by Italy's Riccardo Calafiori tilted the balance in Spain's favour. This win secures Spain's spot in the round of 16 following their earlier impressive 3-0 triumph over Croatia, setting the stage for an exciting progression in the tournament.\n\nThe game began with Spain showing early promise as Barcelona star Pedri forced Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma into a sharp save within the first 90 seconds. Spain's Nico Williams missed a golden opportunity shortly after, failing to convert a headed chance provided by Alvaro Morata, leaving fans and teammates visibly frustrated.\n\nItaly, although initially struggling to establish control, gradually found their rhythm as the first half progressed. Spain continued to dominate possession and chances, with Fabian Ruiz threatening with a powerful strike that Donnarumma managed to tip over the bar.\n\nThe second half saw Spain maintain their attacking intent, with Pedri squandering another clear opportunity to put his team ahead. Italy, meanwhile, resorted to defensive tactics, opting to sit deep and defend in numbers to thwart Spain's relentless attacks.\n\nThe breakthrough for Spain finally arrived in the 55th minute through an unfortunate own goal by Riccardo Calafiori. Nico Williams was instrumental in the build-up, beating his marker before delivering a dangerous cross that deflected off Alvaro Morata and ricocheted off Calafiori into the net, sending the Spanish fans into jubilation.\n\nAndrea Cambiasso's heroic goal-line clearance provided a crucial moment of resilience for Italy as they battled to stay competitive in the contest against Spain. With Spain holding onto their slim 1-0 lead, Cambiasso's timely intervention prevented what could have been a decisive second goal, keeping Italy's hopes alive in the late stages of the match.\n\nItaly's determination to salvage a draw intensified as they earned their first corner of the game in the 85th minute. With time running out, the Azzurri threw numbers forward in search of an equalizer, relying on set-piece opportunities to unsettle Spain's defense. Despite their efforts, a goal from open play seemed increasingly improbable against Spain's organized backline, highlighting the challenge they faced in breaking down their resilient opponents.\n\nSpain's clinical victory over Italy not only secured their place in the knockout stages but also underscored their strong form in the tournament. With six points from two wins, Spain will now focus on maintaining momentum and fine-tuning their strategies ahead of their final group match against Albania.\n\nMeanwhile, Italy, despite the setback, will need to regroup swiftly as the defending champions prepare for a do-or-die encounter against Croatia on Monday, where only a win will keep their hopes of advancing alive.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_AufSchalke", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arena AufSchalke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelsenkirchen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccardo_Calafiori", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Riccardo Calafiori"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianluigi_Donnarumma", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gianluigi Donnarumma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedri", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lvaro_Morata", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lvaro Morata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Cambiasso", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Esteban Cambiasso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Ruiz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Ruiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/War_and_Politics", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/War and Politics", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational_Forces", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational Forces", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://static-ai.asianetnews.com/images/01j0vpq7xv7zcahnpk0c2pypdv/capture.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661646", "eventUri": "eng-9661646", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

It's very difficult to play against us.\"\n\nItaly's usually rock-steady defence was unable to stop the red tide and Donnarumma had to stretch his long frame to tip over a 30-metre rocket from Fabian Ruiz in the 25th minute.\n\nThe first Italian attempt did not come until first-half stoppage time and the almost unending pressure on coach Luciano Spalletti's team resumed immediately after the interval.\n\nThe deadlock was broken in the 55th minute when Williams fired in a cross from the left which glanced off Morata's head and Donnarumma's outstretched fingers before hitting Calafiori on the knee and going in.\n\nSpain poured forward again with Yamal flashing a shot just wide before Williams curled another effort on to the bar.\n\nSpain will finish top of Group B regardless of the outcome of their last match in the opening phase against Albania on Monday, and will play a third-placed side from another group in the last 16.\n\nItaly must avoid defeat in their last group game against Croatia to guarantee qualification.\n\nSpalletti, who took over as Italy boss in September, took issue before the game with suggestions that Spain were a superior attacking force, but by the time the final whistle blew, he acknowledged the difference.\n\n\"They were much stronger than us and the deserved to win,\" he told Italian television. \"When the legs don't work, character and personality don't matter.\"\n\nReuters.", "source": {"uri": "newshub.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newshub"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type":

It could -- and should -- have been more. Spain ended the game with 21 shots to Italy's three. After losing possession in a competitive game for the first time in 136 matches against Croatia, they took the ball back here, but without losing the new directness which is increasingly characterising this side under coach Luis de la Fuente.\n\nThey look well balanced, with Rodri anchoring the midfield, but it is Williams and Yamal who have that ability to bring people to their feet. They are the youngsters who have sparked hope that a fourth European crown could arrive this summer.\n\nTo wander around Gelsenkirchen before the game was to take a walk down memory lane. Names of heroes from the past filled the back of the shirts of the fans of these two storied football nations. Spain supporters toasted Luis Enrique, Ra\u00fal Gonz\u00e1lez and Andres Iniesta. Roberto Baggio and Andrea Pirlo were popular names among the travelling Italy faithful.\n\nLaced amongst them, though, were the names of those trying to write a new chapter in their country's history in Germany. Yamal and Williams' names were omnipresent, especially among the younger generation. They were then omnipresent on the pitch.\n\nIf eyes had often been on Yamal so far, if only because of his age -- he became the youngest player to feature in the finals at 16 years and 338 days old in Spain's opener -- then this time it was Williams' turn to step up -- who at 21 is hardly a veteran himself. Within two minutes, the Athletic Club forward had turned Giovanni Di Lorenzo to set up Pedri, whose header was saved by Gianluigi Donnarumma.\n\nThe pattern was set. Another brilliant solo run followed, Di Lorenzo looking dizzy, and Williams then headed a Morata cross wide when he could have done better.\n\nNot to be outdone, Yamal then dribbled in from the left, beating three Italian defenders before feeding Morata. Again, only the 6'6\" frame of Donnarumma kept the game goalless. By the break, Williams had completed four take-ons while Yamal had three. The other 20 players on the pitch had completed three between them.\n\nSpeaking after the match, Williams said \"I think it's my most complete performance with Spain and I hope to kick on and be able to help the team as much as possible. I've always dreamed of being involved at this level, playing in the Euros and winning Player of the Match.\"\n\nThe King of Spain, Felipe VI, had flown out to Gelsenkirchen for the game -- and he was suitably impressed.\n\n\"It's great to watch them play, we're just missing a goal,\" he told reporters at half time. \"But the sensations are good and the chances we have created... it's been a great first half.\"\n\nSpain's dominance forced the Italy coach into a double substitution before the second half, but it did nothing to change Williams and Yamal's impact. It was Williams' cross, nudged on by Morata, which led to Calafiori's own goal.\n\nOnce ahead, Spain didn't ease up. Yamal, coming inside again, whipped off a fine effort with his left foot which shaved the post. Williams then thumped the bar from the edge of the box. By now, \"Nico\" chants were filling the stadium, Spain's 12,000 supporters outnumbered but out-singing their Italian counterparts.\n\nSpanish newspaper Marca had seen it coming. \"Two Ferraris against Italy,\" was the headline on their front page on Thursday alongside a picture of Williams and Yamal, a nod to the Italian supercar. They may not yet be established at the top level like Rodri, who is widely seen as the one world class player on this team, have the experience of Morata or the Golden Boy awards of Pedri, but they are increasingly the poster boys of this Spain team.\n\nThat is because they offer something different to past Spain teams, who were more focused on touch and possession at times. They have diversified the ways in which De la Fuente's team can win a game. They also offer a glimpse into a more diverse Spain.\n\nThe story of Williams' parents coming to the country from Ghana is well known. Yamal, meanwhile, is the son of a Moroccan and an Equatorial Guinean who was born in Catalonia and grew up in the poor neighbourhood of Rocafonda, outside of Barcelona. His roots are stitched on his boots in the form of the national flags of his parents' homeland and the numbers 304 -- the zip code for Rocafonda.\n\nWilliams entered the dressing room to praise from teammates and family. \"My teammates applauded me in the dressing room and I'd like to thank them for helping me out with their ability on the pitch. When I grabbed my phone, the first message I saw was from my brother straight away, a voice message. He provides unconditional support for me. This is for him, my parents and the Williams family,\" he said.\n\nThe new-look Spain was too much for Italy. The problem was if they doubled up on the wingers, there was space inside for Pedri and Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz. In the end, they could not stop Spain, who must now be considered among the favourites to win Euro 2024.\n\nThe day had actually started with good-humoured food banter between the two sets of fans. \"Aperol Spritz is better than Sangria,\" and \"Pasta is better than Paella,\" were the hand-written sides held up by the fans of Italy, who remain holders of this competition. Food rivalries have been a theme of this tournament.

Until they did.\n\nAn own goal from Riccardo Calafiori in the 55th gave Spain a 1-0 over the defending champion Azzurri in an entertaining encounter from Gelsenkirchen in Group B action at UEFA Euro 2024.\n\nIt was the 12th meeting between the two sides and the fourth in a row at the quadrennial tournament, a Euro record.\n\nSpain got on the front foot from almost the opening whistle with Nico Williams leading the attack on a number of occasions. The Athletic winger was a menace on the right, putting Giovanni Di Lorenzo through the paces at almost every turn. Williams nearly got things started in the second minute. His service into Pedri was on point, but Gianluigi Donnarumma was up to challenge and turned aside the Barcelona man's header.\n\nIn the 11th, it was Williams himself who came close. Latching on to a fine cross from Alvaro Morata, Williams sent his header over the bar.\n\nMidway through the first frame, Donnarumma needed a double save to keep the match scoreless. First he parried away an effort from Morata at a sharp angle before denying Fabian Ruiz from distance in the 26th with a diving stop.\n\nThe two teams headed into the break scoreless with La Roja well aware that a more clinical team would be ahead, potentially by multiple goals.\n\nThe second half began much the way the first did with Spain on the front foot, forcing the Azzurri to keep men behind the ball.\n\nThe dam finally burst for Italy in the 55th.\n\nIt was Williams who once again got things going. He whipped a cross to the front of the net for Morata, who deflected it on goal. Donnarumma parried away, but directly into the path of Calafiori and the Bologna man turned the ball into his own net.\n\nUp a goal, Spain kept coming. In the 59th, a Robin Le Normand header looked like it was going to sneak inside the post if not for the intervention of Andrea Cambiaso. Only two minutes later, 16-year-old Lamine Yamal went just wide with what would have been a special goal.\n\nDonnarumma then kept his team alive once more in stoppage with a pair of fine saves on second-half substitute Ayoze Perez.\n\nSpain saw out the 90 and were full value for the victory. The Azzurri offered very little going forward and barely troubled Unai Simon.\n\nWith Croatia and Albania's 2-2 draw on Wednesday, Spain clinched a spot in the Round of 16 with a victory ahead of Matchday 3.\n\nGroup B wraps up action on Monday with Albania meeting Spain in Dusseldorf and the Azzurri facing off with Croatia in Leipzig.\n\nSpain will be without Rodri for the match after the Manchester City midfielder picked up a second yellow card.", "source": {"uri": "tsn.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "TSN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro",

from their win over Croatia as Aymeric Laporte took the place of Nacho while the attack of Nico Williams, Alvaro Morata and Lamine Yamal continued.\n\nItaly were unchanged from their come-from-behind win over Albania, with Federico Chiesa, Lorenzo Pellegrini and Davide Frattesi supporting lone striker Gianluca Scamacca.\n\nSpain had a quick start as Pedri had a chance to catch the Azzurri cold in the first three minutes after bursting through on goal but goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma kept him at bay.\n\nLuis de la Fuente's charges gained momentum towards the half-hour mark but Donnarumma was on top form, as he denied Yamal and Fabian Ruiz in quick succession.\n\nSpain continued to dominate possession towards the end of the first stanza but they could carve out clear openings and the sides went to the break deadlocked.\n\nLa Roja had a bright start in the second stanza as ten minutes from the interval they eventually went ahead after Riccardo Calafiori could not keep out a flicked header by Morata, as a ricochet went into his own goal off his knee.\n\nSpain remained on the front foot as on the hour-mark Pedri almost doubled their lead after cutting inside and curled a shot that missed narrowly wide.\n\nDe La Fuente looked for different combinations in attack 20 minutes before time, as he eventually withdrew Yamal and brought on Ferran Torres.\n\nWith eight minutes to go, Luciano Spalletti made an attacking change as Giacomo Raspadori replaced Pellegrini and the Azzurri started to threaten, as they got desperate for the equaliser.\n\nHowever, Spain were a threat on transitions and late substitute Ayoze Perez almost sealed the game in added time after dribbling his way through on goal but his point-blank shot was smothered by Donnarumma.\n\nIn the end, La Roja did enough to maintain their 100 percent winning record and qualified for the knockout stages with a game to spare in Group B.\n\nItaly remained second in the section although they fell three points

Morata and Dani Olmo missed in the shootout, and the Azzurri advanced to the final, beating England also on spot kicks.\n\nIn a last-16 encounter in 2016, Italy were again victorious when defender Giorgio Chiellini scored from close range and Graziano Pelle volleyed home in the dying moments for a 2-0 win.\n\nBut in their most important meeting in all competitions, Spain triumphed in the final of Euro 2012 when Vicente del Bosque's all-conquering team thrashed Italy 4-0 in Kyiv.\n\nDavid Silva started the rout with an angled header from a Cesc Fabregas cross and Jordi Alba made it 2-0. Late goals by substitutes Fernando Torres and Juan Mata earned Spain what remains the biggest win in a European Championship final.\n\nThat Euro title was the second in a row won by Spain who were crowned world champions in between at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.\n\nThe stakes will not be as high in Thursday's Group B game at the Arena AufSchalke. Spain and Italy both won their opening matches against Croatia and Albania respectively and look well placed to advance into the knockout rounds.\n\nBut if they finish first and second in the group, they could be on course for another meeting, this time in the final in Berlin on July 14.\n\n(Reporting by William Schomberg; Editing by Toby Chopra)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType":

They are very competitive,\" said De La Fuente. \"It's almost like we're looking in a mirror actually.\n\n\"It could be the final of the European Championship or the World Cup.\"\n\nSpalletti's decision to trust in youth means Italy have the sixth-youngest squad in the Euros and De La Fuente has taken a similar approach.\n\nThe 62-year-old, who coached Spain's youth sides before taking the top job, has put his faith in the likes of Lamine Yamal, who will not turn 17 until the day before the final.\n\nSpain boss Luis de la Fuente on Italy\n\nHe became the youngest player to feature at a Euros when he started the opening match against Croatia and marked the occasion by assisting Spain's third goal in a 3-0 win.\n\nThe Barcelona winger, who is juggling school work while out in Germany, is firmly in the spotlight now - but he is unfazed by it all.\n\n\"It doesn't scare me, I play the same way,\" he said. \"I try to focus on playing well and I think that in the end it only helps me because when I do something well it will be magnified because of my age, obviously.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_de_la_Fuente_(footballer,_born_1961)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis de la Fuente (footballer, born 1961)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Nations_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Nations League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Enrique", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis Enrique"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Mancini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roberto Mancini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciano_Spalletti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luciano Spalletti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational_Forces", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational Forces", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/d828bb9be2d45ee3d67a5595e9822be0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661646", "eventUri": "eng-9661646", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

We need to try and play our own game in our best clothes, but we are willing to scuff up our suit if required.\"\n\nItaly's match with Spain is one of the most anticipated matches of the group stages, pitching the holders against one of several pre-tournament favourites.\n\nSpain won when the two sides met last year in the Nations League semifinal, but it was Italy who emerged victorious via penalties when they faced each other in the last four of Euro 2020, played in 2021.\n\n\"This game tomorrow could be a Euros or World Cup final,\" Spain coach Luis de la Fuente told a news conference later on Wednesday. \"It's a classic between two national teams created to compete at this level.\"\n\nA lot has changed since their last matchup, though, with both teams under new coaching regimes, although Spalletti suggested Italy still have work to do to catch up with Spain.\n\n\"Spain have absolutely everything,\" he added. \"When it comes to individual qualities and the skillset as a team. They always do things in the same way.\n\n\"I am curious to see what happens when they try and press with all 11 men, what we decide to do and how we respond to that. But, overall, I do really like their style.\n\n\"You try to pinch certain ideas and try to analyse certain things. Spanish football is attacking in style. They have a number of players who press high.\n\n\"We must do a good job in terms of finding a free man as quickly as possible. If we don't have a free man, we'll be forced to make a long pass to our forward line.\n\n\"As for whether it's the best brand of football, there are many countries that play positive, attacking football and Spain are one of those. We need to make progress before we can play the same brand of football.\"\n\nDe la Fuente responded by saying his team wouldn't get carried away by the praise from his Italian counterpart.\n\n\"Spalletti a great coach but praise won't weaken us,\" he said \"I have always valued our players and know they don't let us down\n\nOne of the talking points of Spain's 3-0 win over Croatia in their opening game was that they had less possession than their opposition in a competitive game for the first time since the Euro 2008 final -- a streak spanning 136 matches.\n\nThat is in part because La Roja play a slightly more direct style, with two wingers in Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams, and Spalletti acknowledges the threat Luis de la Fuente's side now carry in transition.\n\n\"This Spain team gets the ball forward a bit quicker, they are little more direct, but it depends on who plays as the centre forward,\" he added.\n\n\"There are three forwards who have different skillsets. [Alvaro] Morata is the best at running in behind. He's not lazy. He runs a great deal. In terms of meters cover and speed, his numbers are incredible.\n\n\"The same for Lamine Yamal. He gets the ball high up the pitch, they have two wingers who like one-v-one situations. When we have the ball, we must make sure we are in the right position for a turnover because they are deadly if you leave too much space on the counter.\"\n\nSpain midfielder Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz, though, suggested the stylistic change was more evolution than revolution.\n\n\"I think the style is similar,\" he told reporters. \"Spain have players that like to keep possession and have the ball.\n\n\"The team is characterised by quality players who want ball ... but the coach wants us to be more vertical as well now and to try get in the opposition's half quicker.\"\n\nA win would guarantee either country's place in the knockout rounds, while a draw would also likely be enough for them both to progress from Group B.\n\nItaly, who have a fully fit squad to choose from against Spain, close the group phase against Croatia on Monday, while Spain finish against Albania on the same day.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_marsden@espn.com.sg", "name": "Sam Marsden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Armani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giorgio Armani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_de_la_Fuente_(footballer,_born_1961)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis de la Fuente (footballer, born 1961)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Nations_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Nations League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armani", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Armani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football in Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamine_Yamal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lamine Yamal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabi\u00e1n_Ruiz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lvaro_Morata", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lvaro Morata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0615%2Fr1346277_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661646", "eventUri": "eng-9661646", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

The surprise was not that Luciano Spalletti's side had lost here but that they did so narrowly, somehow alive to the last.\n\nSpain are in the next round; if they continue to play like this, they will surely go further too. Reaching the final, on this evidence, is no fantasy. The concern may be that a destruction so complete did not deliver a more comfortable victory, but what a performance this was, 20 shots fired off, 50 attacks launched, and illustrious opponents taken to pieces from the first minute to the last, when Ayoze P\u00e9rez came on and twice almost made it two. One would have to do, somehow.\n\nIn the buildup to this match Lamine Yamal had talked about the value of taking on the full-back, going one on one from the very start and refusing to let up; football, he said, is a \"psychological game\". If you beat him the first time, you can feel the fear, see it in his eyes. And if you don't, well, then you go back and do it again until you do. That was the theory, the idea the Spain coach drove into his two wingers; here it was in practice.\n\nThe game was only 85 seconds old when Nico Williams raced past Giovanni Di Lorenzo and delivered a glorious cross from which Pedri jumped and headed at goal. A few centimetres either side and it would surely have been the opener, but Gianluigi Donnarumma threw up a hand and pushed it over the bar. Williams had gone outside that time. He would come inside the next time, flying into the area, an opportunity to shoot momentarily opening up. The third time, he went back outside. Poor Di Lorenzo, he just couldn't live with this; it was a wonder his legs weren't tied in a cartoon knot.\n\nNot that Di Lorenzo was alone in his suffering; over on the other side Federico Dimarco was soon having almost as bad a time of it. The game wasn't even four minutes in when Lamine Yamal delivered the first dangerous ball, a warning that he was not going to let up either. Nico and Lamine, Lamine and Nico. Again and again. What a pair they are, two wingers who together are younger than Jes\u00fas Navas and who Italy could not live with. There was an ooh when Williams pirouetted, an aah when Lamine Yamal produced an outrageous touch to escape a wild lunge from Lorenzo Pellegrini. And there was attack after attack.\n\nNor was it just them. Marc Cucurella was superb. Rodri ran this, only he never seems to actually run. Pedri and Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz played. Spain took Italy to pieces, pressing high and also springing from deep. A lovely move began with \u00c1lvaro Morata nodding down and ended with him curling in a wonderful ball top the far post from where Williams nodded a clear opportunity wide.\n\nWilliams then skinned Di Lorenzo again before Lamine Yamal spun 30 yards from goal, left three men on the floor and scrambled the ball to Morata who turned away from Riccardo Calafiori and drew a sharp save from Donnarumma. Next a gorgeous, clean exchange between Pedri, Ruiz and Dani Carvajal worked an opening for Rodri on the edge of the area. Spain could have been three up and they weren't letting up. At half-time, it was almost absurd that they didn't lead. It was 9-1 in shots; Italy's had not come until stoppage time and in fairness it was a decent chance, sliced over by Federico Chiesa.\n\nStill Spain came; still, the chances went. Cucurella got beyond Italy and pulled back the perfect pass. From seven yards, Pedri sidefooted wide. He fell to the floor, head in the turf unable to believe it. Italy, though, could not hold out for ever. In fact, after 11 Spanish attempts, Italy scored the goal for them. Again, Williams did it, accelerating past Di Lorenzo. Morata could only get the slightest touch on the cross and the same was true of Donnarumma. Calafiori got more of one, deflecting into the net.\n\nSpain led but did not rest. This was relentless. Morata's shot was saved. Robin Le Normand's header was cleared off the line. And then Lamine Yamal curled just past the far post from 20 yards; what a goal that would have been. The 16-year-old turned to the stand and gestured for them to get on their feet.\n\nWhat a goal this would have been too: from the other side, Williams cut inside and hit a swinging shot that slammed back off the bar. That Spain's lead was still only one was ridiculous, and there had been a reminder that it wasn't over when Bryan Cristante sent a low cross all the way through the six-yard box where Mateo Retegui just failed to make contact. Spain though would not be denied.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sid_lowe@theguardian.com", "name": "Sid Lowe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamine_Yamal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lamine Yamal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Di_Lorenzo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giovanni Di Lorenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Gonz\u00e1lez_(footballer,_born_2002)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nico Gonz\u00e1lez (footballer, born 2002)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccardo_Calafiori", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riccardo Calafiori"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedri", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayoze_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ayoze P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianluigi_Donnarumma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gianluigi Donnarumma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciano_Spalletti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luciano Spalletti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodri_(footballer,_born_1996)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rodri (footballer, born 1996)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Dimarco", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federico Dimarco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Cucurella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marc Cucurella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jes\u00fas_Navas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jes\u00fas Navas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lvaro_Morata", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lvaro Morata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Pellegrini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Pellegrini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabi\u00e1n_Ruiz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Le_Normand", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robin Le Normand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Cristante", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Cristante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Chiesa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federico Chiesa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Carvajal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dani Carvajal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Ruiz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Ruiz"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Publishing_and_Printing/Binding_and_Finishing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Publishing and Printing/Binding and Finishing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Floors", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Floors", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acf978dd046b14578ba37100104b09affe3f2c66/0_58_5727_3437/master/5727.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=a9fa5daf3e3ab3fd273da774c520f414", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661646", "eventUri": "eng-9661646", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

A first-half blitz saw Alvaro Morata, Fabian Ruiz, and Dani Carvajal find the net, securing a comfortable 3-0 victory.\n\nNotably, the match witnessed the second international appearance of 16-year-old Lamine Yamal, who assisted La Roja's third goal, and a penalty save from goalkeeper Unai Simon.\n\nThis dominant display has fueled optimism in the Spanish camp, with hopes of replicating their 2012 Euro triumph.\n\nItaly, the reigning champions, started their title defense with a slight hiccup.

With both teams eyeing the prestigious title, expect an epic showdown filled with historical significance and high stakes.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelsenkirchen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nedim_Bajrami", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nedim Bajrami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/15_06_2024_03_43_36_0312297.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661646", "eventUri": "eng-9661646", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

At half-time it was 0-0 but that made little sense. It didn't make much sense it was only 1-0 at full-time. There was one side playing deft, modern football and there was one clinging on. Because that side was Italy, and because of their history and reputation, the thought lingered that perhaps they could somehow see it through. They could not.\n\nThese meetings have become something of a Euros tradition. Spain beat Italy on penalties in the quarter-final in 2008, a game that, given their complex about the Italians, was seen as a pivotal psychological moment in Spain's ascent to winning three tournaments in a row, and since then the nations have met at least once in every Euros. They drew in the group then Spain won 4-0 in the final in 2012, Italy won 2-0 on the day England lost to Iceland in Euro 2016, and then Italy put Spain out on penalties in the semi-final three years ago. Which perhaps justifies the Spanish paranoia about the Italian capacity to defy logic and find a way: Italy had only won one of their previous 11 meetings and yet had somehow eliminated them in each of the past two Euros.\n\nFor Italy, meanwhile, the sense of these games at five successive Euros is of pre-eminence lost - they were the reigning world champions at the time of the quarter-final defeat in Vienna - and then, at least before Thursday, a slow closing of the gap as the Spanish philosophy fell out of fashion; even Spain don't play like Spain these days. Not since the 60s have grand theories been the Italian way; Coverciano continues to produce implausible numbers of first-rate coaches but they tend to be pragmatists rather than ideologues.\n\nIn that regard this was Italy's biggest game since the final of the last Euros, less for the result than for the performance and the opportunity to measure themselves in proper competition against an undisputed member of the elite. Although there have been decent results in the Nations League, notably wins over England, Hungary and the Netherlands, they failed to qualify for the last World Cup and were twice comprehensively beaten by England in the qualifiers for this tournament.\n\nThe second of those defeats, it should be said, came just a couple of months after Luciano Spalletti had stepped in as coach following the resignation of Roberto Mancini and the sense has been of gradual improvement since. But it's one thing to hold Ukraine to a 0-0 draw, to secure qualification or to overcome an early shock to beat Albania in the first group game, quite another to take on Spain.\n\nItaly are, notoriously, slow starters, but that used to mean in tournaments as a whole rather than in every game. Having fallen behind after 23 seconds against Albania, they allowed both Pedri and Nico Williams free headers from six yards out within the first 10 minutes. But that was no aberration; that was just the pattern of the game.\n\nOnce the brain had readjusted after England's 1-1 draw with Denmark to watching two teams who could actually pass a ball, the supremacy of Spain was obvious. Poor Giovanni Di Lorenzo was given a terrible chasing by Williams with Federico Chiesa's attempts to cover just inviting Marc Cucurella forward. It quickly became apparent that for Italy this was about survival.\n\nBut that's not a position with which Italy are unfamiliar. Even against the new, more direct Spain the likelihood was always that they would have less possession. In a sense the start just simplified matters. Dig in, hope Gianluigi Donnarumma could keep making saves and get up quickly after clearances to support Gianluca Scamacca. Even the best can start to lose belief if you can thwart them for long enough.\n\nBut the red waves kept coming after half-time. This was a chastening evening for Italy, a night of chasing and hoping. Somehow they even applied some late pressure with a couple of corners, but they could have taken a hammering. The only good news is that they did, just about, keep the score down so victory over Croatia in the final group game will almost certainly take them through. The result of the quadrennial test was clear, and from an Italian point of view, it wasn't pretty.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors":

After conceding the fastest goal in Euros history against Albania in their first game, Italy would have been relieved to see their big goalkeeper come to the rescue.\n\nWilliams made a flying start to this one, as if offended by all the attention lavished upon 16-year-old winger Lamine Yamal since the start of the tournament.\n\nYamal, on the right, is the youngest to ever play in a Euros, but Williams at 21 is another exciting young talent, electric for Athletic Bilbao in the season just ended. Here, he tormented Giovanni Di Lorenzo in the opening stages.\n\nFirst for Pedri's header, then another burst of scintillating pace, jinking past tackles to drag Italy's defensive unit out of shape before they smothered him and then a chance of his own that he really should have finished.\n\nIt was created by Pedri on the counterattack. Williams darted inside from left to right and Alvaro Morata spun wide into the space he left behind, collected a pass and picked out the winger with an excellent cross. Williams leapt to meet it, unmarked at the far post but his header skidded wide.\n\nThis was the perfect example of De la Fuente's new Spain. Dominant in possession and technically adept but willing to override their pure passing principles and strike more directly and quickly on the turnover. It gives them another dimension and makes them far more appealing to watch.\n\nYamal drifted inside from the right to sprinkle a little of his own stardust on affairs. The teenager is as much of a passer than a dribbler but he has the ability to do most things on the ball and he wriggled past two tackles before the ball spun fortuitously from another challenge towards Morata.\n\nDonnarumma produced another save, this one a block with his legs at the neat post, then turned over a sweet drive from distance by Fabian Ruiz. Again, a save he should make, above his head but his goal was under pressure.\n\nItaly resisted. It is one of the things they are good at. They were outplayed by Spain at Wembley in the semi-final of the Euros in 2021 and still beat them on penalties and won the competition. And while they might not boast the individual delights of their opponents, they have plenty of experience in the ranks.\n\nDonnarumma denied Morata again, and finally the Italians summoned their first effort on goal at the end of the first. Federico Chiesa eluded Marc Cucurella and blazed his shot high and wide. It was nothing more than a symbol that Italy remained in the contest.\n\nSpalletti had selected the same team that started against Albania but made two changes during the interval. Off came Jorginho and Davide Frattesi to be replaced by Bryan Cristante and Andrea Cambiaso.\n\nThey seemed to come on with instructions to ruffle Spain and knock them from their rhythm. Cristante had only been on for a few seconds when he picked up a yellow card, leaving Rodri writhing in pain with a late tackle, studs into the top of his foot, but the pattern of play changed very little.\n\nSpain came forward. Italy defended. Pedri fired wide another chance wide, perhaps not as easy as it seemed such was the force of the pass rapped into his feet by Cucurella but the reaction of the young midfielder suggested he thought he should have scored.\n\nThen came the breakthrough with a hint of good fortune. Williams whipped in another cross, which was glanced on by Morata, forcing Donnarumma to react and reach for the low ball. The goalkeeper's intervention, however, only pushed it onto the left knee of centre-half Riccardo Calafiori and from there it pinged into the net.\n\nCambiaso made a vital clearance off the line to keep the lead to one, although, once behind, Italy had more purpose. Spalletti made further substitutions and they took risks as they chased a way back into the game.\n\nTheir supporters even stirred into song, but Williams rattled the frame of the goal and they fell silent again. When Donnarumma saved from Ayoze Perez near the end it was Spain's 20th attempt at goal. How they failed to win more comfortably was the big question.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Spain went on to win 1-0 after Riccardo Calafiori scored an own goal in the second half. The scoreline doesn't tell the exact story as Spain could have had more goals. The win sees Spain reach the knockout stages. Here are further details.\n\nNeco Williams caused problems for Italy with his frightening pace and dribbling. The winger provided an inviting cross for Pedri inside two minutes but the Barcelona midfielder headed straight at Gianluigi Donnarumma, who tipped the ball over the crossbar. Alvaro Morata then picked out Williams at the far post but his header was wide. Donnarumma then denied Morata and Fabian Ruiz.\n\nCredit should also go to Italy for hanging in there as players put their bodies on the line. Spain were all over them, clocking four shots on target from nine attempts and managing 12 shots in the opposition box.\n\nSpain midfielder Rodri made 55 passes in the first half. Its was the most of any player, while he completed 100% of them. He also made the most line-breaking passes (10). As per Squawka, Italy's expected goals of 0.05 is the second-lowest of any side in the first half of a game at Euro 2024. Italy managed just three touches in the opposition box.\n\nSpain started the second half strongly with Pedri steering a shot wide off the post. In the 55th minute, Spain scored when Williams' cross was flicked on by Morata as Donnarumma dived forward and got a touch. The ball flicked off Calafiori and went in. Therafter, Morata's powerful shot saw Donnarumma tip the ball over the crossbar. Spain kept probing but couldn't add another.\n\nAs per Opta, Calafiori is only the second Italian player to concede an own goal between the European Championship and the FIFA World Cup, after Cristian Zaccardo at the 2006 World Cup versus USA. Bryan Cristante received a booking 20 seconds after coming on at half time. It's the fastest on record (since 1980) by a substitute in the finals.\n\nIf not for Donnarumma, Italy could have ended going down by more goals. Toward the death, the Paris Saint-Germain keeper denied substitute Ayoze Perez twice. The former Leicester City man fired a low shot with Donnarumma saving. The keeper then made another brilliant low stop.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianluigi_Donnarumma", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gianluigi Donnarumma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lvaro_Morata", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lvaro Morata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccardo_Calafiori", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riccardo Calafiori"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedri", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_AufSchalke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arena AufSchalke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodri_(footballer,_born_1996)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rodri (footballer, born 1996)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayoze_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ayoze P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Cristante", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Cristante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristian_Zaccardo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cristian Zaccardo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Soccer_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Soccer Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leicester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l41320240621022027.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661646", "eventUri": "eng-9661646", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

It will be tough for us if Spanish defenders always keep their feet on the halfway line.\"\n\nA Nicol\u00f2 Barella goal helped Italy beat Albania on their EURO 2024 debut last week despite a poor start, which allowed their opponents to score after barely 20 seconds.\n\n\"Barella is one of the best footballers for how he plays with and without the ball,\" noted Albertini.\n\n\"Midfielders have changed compared to the '90s and the early 2000s. They have to cover more areas on the pitch. He is similar to Antonio Conte at the beginning of his career and Xavi's last seasons at Barcelona.\"\n\nOdds on some of the best sportsbooks suggest Spain are favourite, but this doesn't mean Italy do not have a chance to emerge victorious, especially considering that the Azzurri beat the Spaniards in the last two editions of the Euros.\n\n\"I really liked the reaction to that early goal and the first-half performance against Albania, but after the break, so and so,\" continued Albertini.\n\n\"I'll just say that we should not leave to Spain all the space we left to Albania.\n\n\"Spalletti has brought enthusiasm back to the national team and we see nice things on the pitch, but we should not forget that games last 90 minutes, not 45,\" warned Albertini.\n\nHowever, the ex-Milan and Azzurri ace agreed with Spalletti that La Nazionale should not put in a defensive performance against La Roja.\n\n\"I think I'd be counterproductive. When you trust your philosophy, it's hard to change,\" he said.\n\n\"Our team doesn't have the skill sets needed to sit back and defend. If you just defend against Spain, you'll concede one goal. Perhaps even more.\n\n\"They may keep the ball longer than us, but we must force them to run backwards, force them to stay in their own half and attack them when we can. We are Italy and we should not have fear.\"\n\nLamine Yamal is the youngest player at EURO 204, but also one of Spain's biggest threats.\n\n\"He has the future in his hands, but he must continue working,\" noted Albertini, an ex-Barcelona midfielder.\n\n\"When you have that talent, it's like a mission. I've seen too many players who could have done more but didn't accept making physical sacrifices during the week. I hope he doesn't become one of those.\"\n\nPerhaps, the 16-year-old should take inspiration from Italy striker Scamacca.\n\n\"He has improved thanks to Gasperini's instilled culture of hard work,\" concluded Albertini.\n\n\"We've known his talent for many years, but now he's found the right club to be decisive.

The win showcased Spain's clear upper-hand over Lucinao Spalletti-managed Italy throughout the match in a rather ruthless manner. It was quite a surprising outcome that the decisive moment of the match came from a 55th minute own goal from Riccardo Calafiori. The win meant a sealed spot in the Round of 16 stage of Euro 2024 for Spain, and an extended fight for the same for Italy.\n\nThe match, which was highly-expected to be an end-to-end thriller by football fans, ultimately showcased Spain's utter dominance over Italy. Be it possession, attacking runs or playmaking, coach Luciano Spalletti's Italy were just no match for the consistently brilliant and persistent attacking abilities of Luis de la Fuente's Spain. Across the entirety of the match, Italy had only taken two shots from which none amongst them were on target, quite a staggering statistic for a side that is the defending champions of the European Championship.\n\nIt is a rather un-just turn of outcome that it was an own goal that gave Spain the lead and not through someone from their end. The likes of Lamine Yamal, Nico Williams and Marc Cucurella were clearly the stand-out names for the Spanish brilliance, which saw the former two be a consistent threat to the Italy backline, and the latter be a warrior in the defence.\n\nFor Italy, Gianluigi Donnarumma will be remembered as the most positive outcome from the match. The Italy goalkeeper and skipper was absolutely relentless between the posts and was easily the difference maker in the side against a massively threatening Spanish attack. A brilliant long-range shot from Fabian Ruiz in the latter part of the first half, a low-paced shot from Alvaro Morata and then again a rocket-shot in the second-half, Donnarumma had an answer to all.\n\nIt is criminally unfortunate that the only time that Donnarumma was by his own teammate Riccardo Calafiori, who netted the 55th minute own goal. Although the defence did put in occasional good shifts by the likes of Calafiori himself and even Andrea Cambiaso, Italy will have to head to the chalkboard to get their approach sorted out.\n\nSpain's brilliant but fruit-less first half could be similar to a collage of attacking runs by Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams. It only sets up as a image for Spanish football's bright future, when 16-year-old Yamal and 21-year-old Williams were the two most threatening figures for a well-established Italy defence. While Yamal;s runs had mostly been about greeting brilliant spaces from between the Azzurri legs, Williams came the closest to scoring with a chance for a free-header in the 11th minute of the game.\n\nSpeed, quick movement of feet and man awareness - these are similar traits that these two players carry and that is something which can give many moments of celebration in the near future.\n\nHowever, both of these players also have a certain loose end when it comes to their finishing abilities, something that screams to get polished to complete brilliance. Williams might have been the player who was most deserving of a goal in the Spanish side. His brilliant strike at goal in the 70th minute shows that it won't take him time to finally get his name up on the scoresheet sooner than later,", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccardo_Calafiori", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riccardo Calafiori"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianluigi_Donnarumma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gianluigi Donnarumma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_AufSchalke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arena AufSchalke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciano_Spalletti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luciano Spalletti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelsenkirchen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamine_Yamal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lamine Yamal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Cucurella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marc Cucurella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Ruiz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Ruiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Cambiaso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrea Cambiaso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lvaro_Morata", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lvaro Morata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football in Spain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Defense_Ministries", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Defense Ministries", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/spain-vs-italy-205425495-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=xOLCkD_v8qThNZR188ydmDly1I3Heq_b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661646", "eventUri": "eng-9661646", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-21", "textStart": 188, "textEnd": 195}], "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

This Mediterranean derby, the 41st clash between the two teams since the 1920s, has seen 'La Furia Roja' emerge victorious 13 times; the Azzurri claim 11 wins and a total of 14 draws. The rich history and intense competition between these two powerhouses make this match a must-watch, filled with end-to-end drama.\n\nNevertheless, Spanish head coach Luis de La Fuente expects to challenge with horizontal possession. Since 2013, he has been the 'entrenador' of Spain's U19, U21 and U23 squads, rising with the players into the national team in Euro 2024.\n\nDespite Spain having a shoo-in on Italy from defeating them in the final of Euro 2012, Spanish soccer has been inferior to Italian soccer in more recent years in European play. Italy eliminated 'La Furia Roja' in the semifinals and quarterfinals of Euro 2020 and Euro 2016, respectively.\n\nThese two powerhouses collide in their eighth encounter at the Euros in the competition's history. As always, this game is an exhilarating spectacle for pundits paying close attention to Group B. Apart from Spain's defeat to Scotland in the qualifying rounds, 'La Roja' had dominated their campaign with seven victories.\n\nLeading up to the match, former Juventus midfielder and manager Fabio Capello, renowned for his coaching of Roma's Scudetto in 2001, shared his thoughts.\n\n\"The Bastoni-Calafiori partnership, with its solid defensive capabilities, could be a formidable force,\" Capello suggested. \"However, they might face challenges in one-on-one situations with rapid strikers, as fast as bullets. The next challenge is Alvaro Morata, who made a strong debut by scoring against Croatia,\"\n\nCapello's concerns about the speed of Alessandro Bastoni and Riccardo Calafiori in a defensive duo might be valid. However, Giovanni Di Lorenzo and Federico Dimarco must compensate for this supposed lack of pacing. The wingbacks, in particular, need to be alert to Morata's rapidity during counter-pressing. This defensive responsibility could force them to be more cautious in their offensive play on the wings. As a result, Federico Chiesa and Davide Frattesi would need to step up and compensate for where Di Lorenzo and Dimarco might fall behind.\n\nItaly can handle talent when it has phenomenal tactics. For example, when Italy eliminated Spain in Euro 2020, the Italians only held 29% of possession and had half as many shot attempts as the Spaniards. Further back, when Italy eliminated Spain at Euro 2016, the Azzurri only had 39% possession and half as many set pieces as La Roja. However, they still managed to beat Spain 2-0.\n\n\"Italians know how to win.\" Roma midfielder Bryan Cristante said. \"We can have our say against anyone.\"\n\nCristante's words are not braggadocio; Italy's history of winning is a class act. The Roma midfielder came in as a tactical substitute in the 77th minute against Albania.\n\nItaly has repeatedly proven that maintaining possession in a match brings the illusion of control. Moreover, the smallest mistouch can result in a counterattack for the opposition. However, once Italy or Spain snipes the opponent's goalmouth using vertical tactics, the Azzurri and La Furia Roja can rely on controlling the game.\n\n\"You decide to control the game's flow,\" Spalletti said. \"But if it becomes a 50/50 match, you have no choice.\" Spalletti added, \"Spain are going to squeeze us more. They bite and press. So, there may be a way to play behind their defensive line.\"\n\nDuring Italy's 2-1 victory against Albania, the Azzurri dominated possession with a whopping 69%. Nevertheless, maintaining possession is counterproductive if it does not lead to creating opportunities. Luciano Spalletti declared that his squad was hesitant to attack during those minutes of domination.\n\n\"We prepared the build-up well but then changed our minds and passed it backward,\" Spalletti said. \"The build-up needs to actually take us somewhere.\"\n\nSpalletti's words apply to Spain's former style of possessional play. Nevertheless, Italy's possession is a testament to its cohesion on the field. When Italy lost possession against Albania, it instantly defended in the final third. When the opposing team's defense gains possession, its backline spreads out, opening lanes for 'through-balls.' By executing a counter-press and reclaiming the ball quickly, it can cause chaos in its defensive formation.\n\nOn matchday one against Croatia, Spain's Fabian Ruiz displayed impressive skill with his footwork and precision. However, Alvaro Morata's first goal against Croatia resulted from a defensive error -- Croatia's high pressing left gaps in their defense. Moreover, Dominik Livakovi\u0107 could have performed better in goal for Croatia. Ultimately, Croatia's weakness rather than Spain's strength led to the match's outcome.\n\nThe epic Mediterranean Derby continues on June 20 at Veltins Arena in Gelsenkirchen, Germany.", "source": {"uri": "worldsoccertalk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Soccer Talk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabio_Capello", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fabio Capello"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Dimarco", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federico Dimarco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Di_Lorenzo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Giovanni Di Lorenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_under-19_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain national under-19 football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby_della_Madonnina", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derby della Madonnina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lvaro_Morata", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lvaro Morata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccardo_Calafiori", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riccardo Calafiori"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davide_Frattesi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Davide Frattesi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Bastoni", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alessandro Bastoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scudetto", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scudetto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Cristante", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Cristante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Chiesa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federico Chiesa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_piece_(football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Set piece (football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciano_Spalletti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luciano Spalletti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

They dominated Italy with their patient possession play, forcing their opponents to chase down the ball all night long and rarely gave them a glimpse of an opportunity. It really was a joy to behold watching this Spain side move the ball around and work the space to attack, with Man City's metronome Rodri at the heart of it. They controlled proceedings and eventually got the goal their performance deserved.\n\nIn case it was not already obvious, this is not the same calibre of Italy team which won the last European Championship by beating England in the final. Luciano Spaletti's much changed squad really struggled against Spain and were quite obviously the second best team on the pitch. Their plan to sit back and counter did not work, with Italy lacking the quality going forward to actually create the chances on the break. Their opening win against Albania means they are still in a strong position to qualify from the group stage but all the signs suggest they are down the pecking order when it comes to likely winners of the competition.\n\nIt had looked like Marc Cucurella's career was going nowhere at Chelsea following his big money move from Brighton in 2022, but these past few months have seen the full-back rejuvenate himself, working his way back in at Stamford Bridge and then into the Spanish national side. He put in an excellent display at left-back, tenaciously winning the ball back when Spain did lose it and combining well with his winger Nico Williams too. He is starting to look like the Cucurella which prompted Chelsea to spend all that money on him in the first place.\n\nThey might have their fair share of problems off the pitch when it comes to the financial picture, but on it Barcelona should feel as though they are in safe hands for the future with Pedri and Lamine Yamal. The Spanish duo showed off their technical ability against Italy and while Pedri will feel he should have done better with his missed chances, both exemplified why they are so highly rated. Yamal at just 16 is a ridiculous talent, and while there is plenty of improvement ahead, time is certainly on his side. That's not to even mention Gavi, who is missing in this tournament through injury.\n\nOwn Goal continues to lead the scoring charts at this summer's competition, with Riccardo Calafiori's blunder taking the number at Euro 2024 to five already. Perhaps it is just a big coincidence, but the number of own goals at this tournament has been startling and is certainly helping out teams who, like Spain, struggled to finish their own opportunities.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccardo_Calafiori", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riccardo Calafiori"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodri_(footballer,_born_1996)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rodri (footballer, born 1996)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Cucurella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marc Cucurella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_&_Hove_Albion_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brighton & Hove Albion F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamine_Yamal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lamine Yamal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavi_(footballer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gavi (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pedri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Bridge_(stadium)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stamford Bridge (stadium)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye_Coordination", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye Coordination", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Sidesaddle", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Sidesaddle", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/l7F_t_lE6oAbtnz3PwobdA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hayters_tv_491/ec864b9d0f9e2f1c379aa77b069a0f1c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661646", "eventUri": "eng-9661646", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

They always do things in the same way.\n\n\"I am curious to see what happens when they try and press with all 11 men, what we decide to do and how we respond to that. But, overall, I do really like their style.\n\n\"You try to pinch certain ideas and try to analyse certain things. Spanish football is attacking in style. They have a number of players who press high.\n\n\"We must do a good job in terms of finding a free man as quickly as possible. If we don't have a free man, we'll be forced to make a long pass to our forward line.\n\n\"As for whether it's the best brand of football, there are many countries that play positive, attacking football and Spain are one of those. We need to make progress before we can play the same brand of football.\"\n\nOne of the talking points of Spain's 3-0 win over Croatia in their opening game was that they had less possession than their opposition in a competitive game for the first time since the Euro 2008 final -- a streak spanning 136 matches.\n\nThat is in part because La Roja play a slightly more direct style, with two wingers in Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams, and Spalletti acknowledges the threat Luis de la Fuente's side now carry in transition.\n\n\"This Spain team gets the ball forward a bit quicker, they are little more direct, but it depends on who plays as the centre forward,\" he added.\n\n\"There are three forwards who have different skillsets. [Alvaro] Morata is the best at running in behind. He's not lazy. He runs a great deal. In terms of meters cover and speed, his numbers are incredible.\n\n\"The same for Lamine Yamal. He gets the ball high up the pitch, they have two wingers who like one-v-one situations. When we have the ball, we must make sure we are in the right position for a turnover because they are deadly if you leave too much space on the counter.\"\n\nA win would guarantee either country's place in the knockout rounds, while a draw would also likely be enough for them both to progress from Group B.\n\nItaly, who have a fully fit squad to choose from against Spain, close the group phase against Croatia on Monday, while Spain finish against Albania on the same day.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Armani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giorgio Armani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Nations_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Nations League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football in Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamine_Yamal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lamine Yamal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_de_la_Fuente_(footballer,_born_1961)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis de la Fuente (footballer, born 1961)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lvaro_Morata", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lvaro Morata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0615%2Fr1346277_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661646", "eventUri": "eng-9661646", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

With nothing separating the two heavyweights of European soccer at the end of extra-time, Jorginho stroked in the winning spot-kick moments after Gigi Donnarumma saved from Alvaro Morata. Italy advanced on penalties.\n\nMuch has changed for both nations since that meeting at Wembley: Roberto Mancini and Luis Enrique handed in their respective resignations and only 23 of the 50 combined players from 2021 made it to Germany this year.\n\nAt Euro 2024, Total Calcio will meet a more direct version of Tiki-Taka in Gelsenkirchen. Incumbent managers Luciano Spalletti and Luis De La Fuente have done their best to rejuvenate their nations. Superstars Giorgio Chiellini and Sergio Busquets have vacated for prodigious talents like Riccardo Calafiori and Fermin Lopez.\n\nWith the responsibility of leadership bequeathed to Donnarumma and Morata, Nicolo Barella and Rodri now influence the speed and the direction of play. While Federico Chiesa is still Italy's best attacker, Gianluca Scamacca has finally announced himself. Barcelona starlet Lamine Yamal is the new darling of La Roja supporters.\n\nIndeed, there is much to love about both reincarnations but Spain is undoubtedly ahead in terms of quality and Italy knows it. And with world-class midfielder Sandro Tonali unavailable for selection, Spalletti is counting on Inter Milan's Davide Frattesi to make an impact.\n\n\"Individually, Spain is ahead of us,\" Frattesi admitted. \"We need to bring that Italian spirit that we've shown for many years on the field, that fighting spirit.\"\n\nFighting spirit got the job done for Italy on Saturday, the Azzurri swinging back to win 2-1 after a frightening start to the campaign when Albania's Nedim Bajrami scored after 23 seconds (a new tournament record) when he intercepted Federico Dimarco's throw-in and lashed the ball home.\n\n\"It was a positive shock for us,\" Chiesa explained. \"This will serve as a lesson for our upcoming games.\"\n\nBut maturity and self-belief can transform negative energy into tenacity, something that was sorely missing under former coach Gian Piero Ventura but was reborn during Roberto Mancini's 37-match undefeated streak - a world record so impressive that even Lionel Messi's Argentina fell short of it in 2022.\n\nLike Spain against Croatia, Italy manifested its destiny and held firm: Bajrami's goal was Albania's last shot on target until the final kick of the game.\n\nSpain's defensive form speaks for itself. Aside from their 3-3 friendly with Brazil, they're yet to concede more than one goal in a match since Scotland put two past them in Glasgow - a positive shock of their own which has since lasted fifteen months.\n\nWith both managers tasting success in their opening group games, Spalletti and De La Fuente have roused nationwide support back home. Euros fever is sweeping the Mediterranean, and despite Italy's underdog status, Spalletti brazenly laid out how his team can confront the more fancied Spaniards via intimidation and speed.\n\n\"We need to be meaner,\" Spalletti explained after Italy's victory over Albania. \"Neat and tidy in the way we build things up, you free up a man but then you need to go and hurt the opposition ... we thought we were brilliant at just keeping possession.\"\n\nPossession Football doesn't necessarily translate into goals and is no longer the tenet of Spain's play under De La Fuente, the 62-year-old preferring a more direct route to goal compared to his predecessors.\n\n\"Maybe in other times, having more of the ball guaranteed better results, now we are a team who can surprise teams like we have today,\" De la Fuente said after Spain beat Croatia.\n\nInterestingly, he and Spalletti share numerous coaching philosophies, preferring quick decision-making over repetitive and predictable passing lanes. Both also advocate for directness when the midfield spaces are congested.\n\nFor years now, modern coaching methods have rendered rudimentary soccer systems useless. To argue that players are simply deployed in their named positions is comprehensively reductive, especially when you have the weaker team - see Thiago Motta and Bologna FC.\n\nSpalletti's success at Napoli was dependent upon his tactical adaptability. He studied and anticipated his opponents in a calculated manner. Now he's bringing that into the international arena.\n\n\"Spain will probably set up differently based on how we played tonight,\" Spalletti predicted. \"They are going to squeeze us a little bit more. We will probably play the ball forward more. Be more direct.\"\n\nBut is Spalletti really this brazen, allowing De La Fuente to know precisely what he's thinking? It's difficult to know if these are mind games or whether honesty is the best policy. Either way, Italy must be composed at the back to stand any chance.\n\nSpalletti must choose which wide defender will best nullify Yamal's impact, which central midfielder should shield Jorginho from the Spain's ferocious pressing, and whether Mateo Retegui - a native Spanish speaker - is better suited than Scamacca for those long balls pumped over the top by Alessandro Bastoni.\n\n\"Most probably against Spain, we'll have more opportunities because they tend to be more aggressive,\" Spalletti continued. \"They bite and press. So there may be a way to go and play behind the defensive line.\"\n\nIt was Chiesa who pierced the Spanish defensive line to give Italy the lead at Euro 2020, curling beautifully beyond Unai Simon. The 26-year-old starred for the Nazionale while Morata equalised late.\n\nThree years is an extremely long time in sport. Aside from missing out on the World Cup, Italy has lost twice to Spain in the UEFA Nations League, and no one could have predicted that Morocco would knock Luis Enrique off his perch in Qatar.\n\nMoreover, nobody saw Napoli's Serie A title coming, a feather in the cap for the best tactician at Euro 2024 who knows that the best way to beat a superpower like Spain is to play them at their own game.\n\n\"If we don't play good football, there are teams that are better than us.\" Spalletti hinted. \"If you go and play with the same things that the better teams have, then they will win.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianluigi_Donnarumma", "type": "person", "score": 5,

Finney/Getty Images\n\nRetooled versions of Spain and Italy meet on Thursday in a highly anticipated Euro 2024 Group B encounter between the winners of three of the last four European Championships.\n\nBoth sides have shown a different style of football in Germany from what fans typically expect.\n\nSpain thrashed Croatia 3-0 in their opener on Saturday playing a faster, more direct approach than the possession-based \"tiki-taka\" style which saw them crowned European champions in 2008 and 2012 as well as World Cup winners in 2010.\n\nWith their golden generation of pass masters Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez, Andres Iniesta and Xabi Alonso long gone, Spain have transitioned to a more flexible approach under new manager Luis de la Fuente which is better suited to the young, versatile squad at his disposal.\n\nAgainst an ageing Croatia side, Spain applied a relentless high press combined with quick transitions that seemed to catch their rivals off-guard.\n\n\"We are turning the national team into a team that have many faces,\" De la Fuente told a press conference on Saturday.\n\n\"The other countries no longer know what kind of attack we are going to implement and this is a reason to be very happy because it could put Spain back on the level that is expected from us.\"\n\nWith doubt surrounding the status of midfielder Rodri and captain Alvaro Morata after they picked up injuries against Croatia, De la Fuente, 62, has been keeping his cards close to his chest for Thursday's match, closing Spain's practice to the media for two consecutive days.\n\nDefending champions Italy, beaten 4-0 by Spain in the 2012 final, see little point in trying to disguise their intentions.\n\nTasked with restoring belief for fans devastated by their failure to quality for the last two World Cups, manager Luciano Spalletti has put his own mark on the side since taking over last year after winning the Serie A title with Napoli.\n\nSteering clear of Italy's traditional 'defence-first' Catenaccio system, Spalletti has implemented a more attack-minded approach, which they used to great effect in beating Albania 2-1 in their opener.\n\nUnder Spalletti Italy seek to control possession and dominate small areas of the pitch with intense pressure, allowing Nicolo Barella and Lorenzo Pellegrini to service forwards Davide Frattesi and Federico Chiesa on the wings.\n\nIf styles make fights, Thursday's match in Gelsenkirchen should be a cracker. -- Reuters", "source": {"uri": "heraldlive.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "HeraldLIVE"}, "authors": [],

And Nico Williams just would not stop coming at them.\n\nAttack after attack, an unsparing, devastating opponent who looked like he could keep doing this long into the night and never get tired. Luciano Spalletti, the Italy coach, had sent on Cambiaso at half-time in the hope that, in tandem with Di Lorenzo, they might at least be able to discourage the juggernaut down Spain's right flank. The problem was Williams took even greater pleasure and motivation from the chance to wreak double the destruction.\n\nBy the time the Athletic Bilbao forward took his leave to a standing ovation with 12 minutes remaining, having hit the crossbar, dazzled and delighted and conjured the move that would see Italy's Riccardo Calafiori turn the ball into his own net for the goal that settled a grotesquely one-sided game, Italy's defence looked out on its feet.\n\nThe 1-0 scoreline did scant justice to the scale of Spain's dominance or the majesty of a display that had a bit of everything bar the bundle of goals their superiority and sublime football deserved. Only Italy's goalkeeper, Gianluigi Donnarumma, who made two fine saves late in the game to deny Mikel Oyarzabal after a series of fine first half stops, prevented La Roja from running up a cricket score here.\n\nWilliams was the stand-out performer, a relentless, irresistible force in partnership with Marc Cucurella down the left, but there were outstanding displays all over the pitch. No one will want to be paired with Luis de la Fuente's side on this form in the knockout rounds.\n\nItaly need a draw against Croatia to be sure of reaching the last 16. If they lose things could get very hairy.\n\nSpain have won Group B with a game to spare, and served notice that they are serious contenders to win the whole bleedin' thing. Forget the scoreline: 4-0 wouldn't have flattered Spain, who produced the best performance of the tournament so far.\n\nThis is a different version of Spain, who rely on individual brilliance, particularly dribbling, as much as tiki-taka. Lamine Yamal was exhilarating, Nico Williams even better, and Italy's right-back Giovanni Di Lorenzo is off to hospital with twisted blood.\n\nCarvajal is booked for being Dani Carvajal, then Donnarumma comes up for a corner. Nothing comes of it and that should be that.\n\nSpain substitution Mikel Merino comes on for the weary Fabian Ruiz, who was again terrific.\n\nPerez nutmegs poor old Di Lorenzo on the left, cuts into the area and drives a low shot that is pushed away at the near post by Donnarumma.\n\nMoments later Donnarumma makes an even better save, plunging to his left when Perez runs through one on one and tries to curl the ball across him.\n\nDonnarumma has saved Italy from a rare old thumping.\n\nThere will be four minutes of added time.\n\nCarvajal makes a meal of a nothing challenge from Retegui, which leads to a bit of arguing on the halfway line. It peters out soon enough.\n\nFor the first time all night Spain are under pressure. Italy's attacking remains desperate and a bit haphazard, but at least they're managing to attack.\n\nCarvajal concedes a corner, Italy's first of the match I think. Bastoni squares up to Carvajal before it is taken, so the referee tells them both to calm down - not once but twice.\n\nEventually the corner is helped on by Cristante and bounces straight into the arms of Simon.\n\nThis is definitely Italy's spell, although these things are relative. Spain still look comfortable, and Unai Simon still hasn't had a save to make.\n\nItaly substitution Giacomo Raspadori on, Lorenzo Pellegrini off.\n\nAs it stands Spain will win Group B with a game to spare, which would mean a last 16 game against one of the third-placed qualifiers.\n\nLaporte heads over at the far post after a short corner. The ball was too high for him to control the header.\n\nItaly have had more of the ball since going behind, and there's a warning for Spain when Dimarco's free-kick only just evades the unmarked Di Lorenzo at the far post.\n\nThey still haven't had a shot on target, mind.\n\nDouble substitution for Spain Ayoze Perez and Mikel Oyarzabal come on for Alvaro Morata and the brilliant Nico Williams.\n\nAnother foul by Le Normand gives Italy a free-kick 25 yards out. Pellegrini whips a fairly tame effort over the bar.\n\nDouble substitution for Spain Ferran Torres and Alex Baena replace Pedri and Lamine Yamal.\n\nWilliams hits the bar! Spain continue to look utterly brilliant. Williams cuts inside from the left, away from poor old Di Lorenzo, and smashes a curler across goal from the edge of the area. It beats even the telescopic arm of Donnarumma, leaping desperately to his left, and thumps off the top of the crossbar.\n\nLe Normand gets a yellow card for an earthy tackle on Zaccagni.\n\nA rare opening for Italy. Cambiaso takes advantage of a mistake from Rodri to gallop into space on the right, move infield and cross. Retegui goes for the ball at the near post along with a Spanish defender, but neither player manages to make contact and the ball rolls across the six-yard box to safety.\n\nDouble substitution for Italy Mattia Zaccagni and Mateo Retegui come on for Federico Chiesa and Gianluca Scamacca.\n\nThis might be Spain's best performance at a major tournament since their stunning defenestration of Italy in the Euro 2012 final. They won 4-0 that night; a similar score here would not particularly flatter them.\n\nSpain keep the ball for an age, every pass accompanied by an ol\u00e9. Then, out of nothing, Yamal whips an extravagant curler from 20 yards that beats Donnarumma and flashes just past the post. What a glorious goal that would have been.\n\nSod that, what a glorious moment it was: he's 16 for heaven's sake.\n\nOff the line by Cambiaso! Williams swings the resulting corner to the far post, where Le Normand plants a header back across goal. It beats Donnarumma and is hooked clear by Cambiaso on the line. It might not have been going in, though my suspicion is it would have hit the inside of the post and bounced into the net.\n\nAfter another quick Spain break, Morata smashes a rising drive from 25 yards that is pushed over one-handed by Donnarumma. Sweetly struck but too close to the keeper.\n\nPedri zig-zags into the Italy area, forcing Donnarumma to rush from his line and grab the ball. Jeez, Spain have been magnificent tonight.\n\n55 min: Spain 1 Italy 0 (Calafiori og) A goal was in the post from the first whistle, and it has finally arrived. Williams twisted the hapless Di Lorenzo inside out on the left and hammered a dangerous low cross into the six-yard box. It brushed the head of Morata at the near post, then the diving Donnarumma pushed the ball off Calafiori and into the net.\n\nCalafiori was blameless. So, in truth, was Donnarumma: although Morata's header wasn't on target, he couldn't let it flash across his six-yard box.\n\nPedri whistles a decent effort from 25 yards that is patted down by Donnarumma and grabbed at the second attempt.\n\nJust wide by Pedri! Williams plays in the underlapping Cucurella, who picks out Pedro at the near post with a sharp cutback. Pedri tries to open his body but mistimes the movement and sidefoots wide from eight yards. That was a terrific chance. He might even have had time to take a touch.\n\nSpain have picked up where they left off and have set up camp in the Italy half. It will frustrate the life out of them if they don't win this game after playing so much good football. Maybe it's a job for Joselu.\n\nRodri gets gingerly to his feet after receiving treatment for around 90 seconds. Cristante stood on his foot, and for a minute it looked like he might have broken a metatarsal. I think he's okay.\n\nThe substitute Cristante is booked inside 22 seconds for crumping Rodri. Outstanding.\n\nLuciano Spalletti doesn't want to endure another 45 minutes like that. He's brought on Andrea Cambiaso and Bryan Cristante for Jorginho and Davide Frattesi.\n\nA goalless thrashing in Gelsenkirchen. Spain have been exhilarating, Nico Williams in particular, but also wasteful in front of goal. Italy have been so busy putting out fires that they've barely had time to attack.\n\nChiesa wafts indulgently over the bar from the edge of the area to end a promising Italy break. It's their first shot at goal.\n\nMoments later Rodri is booked for dissent.\n\nCalafiori shoves over Le Normand, who then lands painfully on Dimarco's leg. He's okay.\n\nA loose ball runs invitingly towards Fabian Ruiz, 25 yards out. His shot is sweetly struck but straight at Donnarumma. That's Spain's ninth attempt at goal, four on target. Italy have had the square root of bugger all.\n\nLaporte's ball forward is flicked ingeniously behind his standing leg by Williams to find Pedri. He returns the ball to Williams, who is crucially challenged in the area by Bastoni.\n\nSpain have played some delightful, high-speed football.\n\nWilliams is fouled on the left wing by Di Lorenzo, who is lucky not to be booked. It'll be a surprise if he still knows what day it is too.\n\nWilliams tries a training-ground free-kick, driving the ball back to Fabian Ruiz. He shoots high over the bar.\n\nSpain have been so impressive, dominating every facet of the game. Italy 1-0 it is then.\n\nPure as the driven snow that strike.\n\nSheer delightful football from Spain. Fabian Ruiz plays an extravagant reverse pass to Carvajal, who eschews a low cross and instead cuts the ball back to Rodri in the D. He sweeps a first-time shot that is blocked by Bastoni.\n\nRodri shoots well wide from distance. Spain have made all the running so far.\n\nLovely save by Donnarumma! Fabian Ruiz finds space 25 yards out and hits a left-footed heatseeker that is superbly tipped over by Donnarumma, leaping to his left. That was such a pure strike from Fabian Ruiz.\n\nChance for Spain! Gorgeous play from Yamal, who beats two players through sleight of hip before being crowded out on the edge of the area. The ball runs through to Morata, whose shot from a tight angle is well blocked by Donnarumma.\n\nThis could be a long night for Giovanni Di Lorenzo the way things are shaping up. Nico Williams has been superb and has the Italy right back on toast at the moment.\n\nDimarco finds space on the left, only to pull his cross behind the four Italian players in the middle. That was half a chance, and unusually poor from Dimarco.\n\nWilliams nutmegs Di Lorenzo on the left edge of the area, but this time Jorginho comes across to sweep up. Nico Williams's dribbling has been sensational.\n\nSpain continue to dominate. Yamal has also made a bright start - not quite as coruscating as Williams on the other side, but still a constant threat to Federico Dimarco. It boggles the mind that he's 16 years old.\n\nMorata has a shot blocked just inside the area, then Donnarumma is booked for dissent. He was unhappy that the referee didn't stop play before Morata's shot because Di Lorenzo was down with a head injury.\n\nAnother great chance for Spain! This is thrilling stuff. Spain break at pace - no tiki-taka here - and Morata pulls left before whipping a magnificent early cross to the far post. Williams is unmarked, seven yards out, but his header flashes just wide.\n\nThat was a terrific chance, probably even better than Pedri's.\n\nPellegrini's clever stooping header almost releases Scamacca, but he doesn't fancy a race with Le Normand and his backheel goes astray.\n\nA foul by Pedri on Pellegrini gives Italy the chance to get their bearings while Pellegrini receives treatment. Spain have made a blistering start.\n\nAnother scintillating run from Williams, who nutmegs Barella - and puts him on the floor - then cuts away from Jorginho in the area. That touch is slightly heavy, which allows another Italian defender to make a vital challenge. Some start this from Spain.\n\nGreat chance for Spain! Nico Williams dizzies Di Lorenzo with a stepover or three and stands up a lovely cross into the six-yard box. Pedri meets it with a slightly sheepish header that still requires a fine save from Donnarumma, leaping to push it over the bar.\n\nAnd action. Italy, in their white change strip, kick off from right to left as we watch.\n\nGood to see Donnarumma belting out the Italian national anthem Chiellini style. Okay, maybe not quite as intensely as that but he's giving it a good go. Luciano Spalletti too. Feeling every word that man.\n\nIt's something of a war of attrition to get to the Veltins Arena in Gelsenkirchen so let's hope the game is less of a grind. There was some colourful talk from the Italy coach Luciano Spalletti before the game. \"We wear Giorgio Armani and Giorgio Armani is known around the whole world,\" he said. \"We will be there, well dressed but ready to get our clothes dirty if needed.\" So Spain have been warned.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how both sides approach it. Spain were more direct in their 3-0 win over Croatia but they do press aggressively and Italy - who did well bypassing Albania's press - may feel there is space in behind to exploit. Nacho is injured but Aymeric Laporte has come into the left centre-half position for Spain after missing the opening game. Spain are otherwise unchanged while Italy field the same starting XI from their 2-1 win over Albania.\n\nA win for either team would clinch their place in the last 16 - and as group winners, which would mean a match against one of the third-place qualifiers.\n\nA draw would leave both teams needing a draw in their final game to be sure of going through.\n\nSpain made Croatia look docile in the first-half on Saturday, whilst Italy were made to work for their 3 points against Albania. Back your predictions for the game with these Euros betting offers.\n\nHello and welcome to live, minute-by-minute coverage of Spain v Italy in Gelsenkirchen. This, with a respectful nod to the previous 17 games, is the first heavyweight clash of Euro 2024. It's also a familiar one, the sixth meeting between Spain and Italy in the last five European Championships. Usually they cross paths in the knockout stages, which may happen again this year, but tonight is about qualifying with a game to spare and making a statement of tournament-winning intent.\n\nIt's probably a bigger game for the reigning champions Italy, who have a tougher final match (against Croatia) and will be vulnerable if they lose tonight. They started with a 2-1 win over Albania that was both impressive and nervy, while Spain were slightly flattered by their 3-0 win over Croatia. Even so there was plenty to catch the eye, most notably the performance of the astonishing 16-year-old Lamine Yamal.\n\n\"Spain vs Italy is a classic game, it could very easily be the final,\" said the Spain coach Luis de La Fuente. \"They have great players, a great coach, and a real football culture. They're one of the great national teams.\"\n\nAs are Spain after their unprecedented success between 2008 and 2012. A key rite of passage was their penalty shootout victory over Italy, who had been their nemesis at major tournaments, in the quarter-final of Euro 2008.\n\n\"This is one of the most important matches of my career; I've already been through some important games but this is right up there,\" says Luciano Spalletti. \"This is one of those matches that could give the players a tale to tell in the future.\"\n\nKick off 8pm.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams",

Well, this was a dominant and confident display that suggests otherwise. Brilliant performance.\n\nAymeric Laporte - 7\n\nMuch like with N'Golo Kante, it is a real head-scratcher why a player of this quality is spending prime years playing in the Saudi Pro League. Was a calming presence next to Le Normand and he restricted Gianluca Scamacca to nothing.\n\nAymeric Laporte (right) produced a solid display which raises questions why he is plying his trade in domestic football in Saudi Arabia with Al-Nassr\n\nRobin Le Normand - 6.5\n\nA rising star in the game but he can be rash and did give some free-kicks away in dangerous areas here which won't have pleased his manager. The Real Sociedad centre back is not afraid to be physical and now it's about refining his reading of the game.\n\nDani Carvajal - 6.5\n\nWith Lorenzo Pellegrini and Federico Chiesa falling flat on the night, this was perhaps an easier assignment than the Real Madrid veteran may have anticipated. Knows the dark arts well and used his experience to slow this down when Italy felt like they were on the cusp of building some momentum.\n\nRodri - 7\n\nThe ease at which he can run a game has become taken for granted but Italy couldn't get near Spain's midfield and he was a large reason why. Picked up a silly booking in the final seconds of the first half and will now miss final group game against Albania. Booked.\n\nFabian Ruiz - 7.5\n\nWhat a player he is. Magnificent in the opening game against Croatia and this was another statement display from the Paris Saint-Germain star. By the end of the night he had his markers - plural - heads spinning.\n\nFabian Ruiz has been one of this tournament's best and this was another dazzling display\n\nPedri - 7\n\nReally should have scored but this was another display that reminded folk just why this player is going to establish himself as one of the world's best in his position.\n\nRead More The 16-year-old Euros star doing homework between games: Lamine Yamal is the wonderkid with a secret\n\nNico Williams - 8\n\nOne of the performances of the tournament so far. This was a magical display that was direct, exciting and had Italian defenders heads' spinning. It was his cross that, with the help of an Alvaro Morata header, led to the opening goal. He then smashed a curling effort onto the crossbar which would have been a goal this thrilling display deserved. MOTM.\n\nAlvaro Morata - 6\n\nWas too comfortable drifting out wide in the early stages when he needs to retain his poacher's instinct to stay within the posts. It was his near-post header which helped lead to the opening goal and he was unfortunate not to have another assist to his name earlier in the contest.\n\nLamine Yamal - 6.5\n\nThe fearlessness with which this 16-year-old is a frightening prospect for years to come. Almost produced one of the goals of the tournament when he narrowly missed the top corner with a curling effort in the second half.\n\nCOACH: Luis de la Fuente - 7\n\nThey arrived at this tournament with little expectation given the youthful nature of this group but he is managing to put players in positions to maximise their skill-sets. Take note, Gareth Southgate.\n\nLuis de la Fuente is successfully putting Spain's youngsters into the best positions to succeed\n\nSUBS\n\nAlex Baena (for Pedri, 71) - 6.5\n\nFerran Torres (for Lamine Yamal, 71) - 6\n\nAyoze Perez (for Alvaro Morata, 78) - 6.5\n\nMikel Oyarzabal (for Nico Williams, 78) - 6\n\nMikel Merino (for Fabian Ruiz, 90+4)\n\nITALY (4-3-3)\n\nGianluigi Donnarumma - 7\n\nWas incredulous when he was booked for dissent, despite being allowed to speak to the referee in his role as captain. Made a number of crucial stops in the first half when Spain peppered his goal but there was little more he could do for the opening goal.\n\nFederico Dimarco - 6\n\nWas the better of the two Italian full-backs on the night in that he was at least able to make life hard for 16-year-old Lamine Yamal. Offered little for Spain to think about at the other end, though, and that needs to change.\n\nRiccardo Calafiori - 6\n\nHardly had a moment to react before the ball cannoned in off his knee to give Spain a deserved lead. Alvaro Morata's header was tipped by Donnarumma and it was in before Calafiori even knew it was at his feet.\n\nAlessandro Bastoni - 6.5\n\nProvided a good jousting partner in his battle with Alvaro Morata and made a number of key interceptions when Italy found themselves under the cosh. The 25-year-old has the skillset that should see him as a man in real demand among England's elite in the coming years.\n\nAlessandro Bastoni (back) was one of the few bright spots on a difficult night for Italy\n\nGiovanni Di Lorenzo - 5.5\n\nA long, long evening for the 30-year-old. He was totally dominated here by Nico Williams and he was turned inside out with some ease for Williams' cross to tee up the opening goal. Will become an easy target if Italy progress much further in this tournament.\n\nJorginho - 6\n\nHooked at half-time. It was tough going for the Arsenal man in the 45 minutes he was on the pitch as Spain dominated in midfield through the brilliance of Fabian Ruiz, Rodri and Pedri. Played his part at making sure Italy were disciplined enough to remain at 0-0 at the break.\n\nNicolo Barella - 6.5\n\nWas left writhing in pain early in this contest after a nasty whack from Le Normand, and thereafter he struggled to take the game by the scruff of its neck. Technically sublime when he gets on the ball but this was a night where he and his team-mates found themselves suffocated as soon as they set foot in Spain's half.\n\nDavide Frattesi - 5.5\n\nA largely peripheral figure in a first half which was gruelling for Italy's players, who spent most of the time running after darting red shirts. Was part of a double change at the break as Luciano Spalletti desperately tried to stem the tide.\n\nDavide Frattesi left a lot to be desired and it was no shock to see him hooked at half-time\n\nLorenzo Pellegrini - 6\n\nOn a night where Italy had 42 per cent of the ball, service into the frontmen was limited to say the least. Seemed to get swallowed up by the game as his influence waned - quickly.\n\nGianluca Scamacca - 5\n\nOffered next to nothing in truth. Italy's lack of a razor sharp striker is what many expect to hold them back from retaining their title and on this evidence, that theory has plenty of weight behind it.\n\nFederico Chiesa - 5.5\n\nLargely anonymous which won't do given his obvious talent. It was a frustrating display that perhaps explained why Juventus seem willing to move on from the winger this summer. Booked.\n\nCOACH: Luciano Spalletti - 6\n\nMade plenty of changes and was bold to make a double substitution at half-time. But, in truth, he got out-coached on the night and you don't say that too often with an Italy team. Still all to play for to progress and from there, a steep improvement needed.\n\nSUBS\n\nBryan Cristante (for Davide Frattesi, 46) - 5\n\nAndrea Cambiaso (for Jorginho, 46) - 5\n\nMattia Zaccagni (for

There's a lot of top teams in this competition.\"\n\nItaly manager Luciano Spalletti: \"When we had 3-4 fresher players we managed to stay more intense, retrieved more high balls and created situations that could have led us to draw the match. But they were much stronger than us and won deservedly.\"\n\n\"When the legs don't work, character and personality don't matter,\" he added.\n\n\"We never got to midfield, we were always very long and every time we won the ball back sometimes they took it away from us, other times it was an inaccurate, untargeted choice.

Nico Williams shone with a remarkable display and player of the match performance. Fabian Ruiz stood out in midfield, while Pedri Marc Cucurella also had a solid game.\n\nSpain assured their passage through to the knock-out stages of Euro 2024 with a dominant display over Italy.\n\nLuis De La Fuente's men got off to a very fast start, with Italy unable to cope with the Spaniard's intensity. Both Pedri and Nico Williams came agonisingly close to opening the scoring with close-range headers. The latter of which reall should've ended up in the back of the net.\n\nThe 21-year-old did pull off the skill of the tournament though, producing a Cruyff turn on the half volley to get past Alessandro Bastoni. That was before Fabian Ruiz was denied from distance by a brilliant save from Gianluigi Donnarumma.\n\nThe second half started just as the first, with Pedri missing another guilt edge opportunity as he steered Marc Cucurella's cross wide from close range. Thankfully for the two-time European champions, Italy were on helping hand to help Spain take the lead, with Riccardo Calafiori bundling the ball into an empty net. It was almost two own goals shortly after, but Calafiori's header was cleared off the line by substitute Andrea Cambiaso.\n\nArsenal target Williams nearly capped off a brilliant night, but saw his curling effort smack against the crossbar. Ultimately, it mattered little as Spain were able to hang on to a comfortable three points.\n\nMatch Highlights Spain vs Italy Player Ratings GK: Unai Simon - 6/10\n\nDidn't have to make a save of any note. It was that kind of night for the goalkeeper.\n\nRB: Dani Carvajal - 6/10\n\nThe Real Madrid cult hero wasn't as dynamic as his counterpart on the other side of the pitch. However, he did provide some good support for young Yamal.\n\nCB: Robin Le Normand - 6/10\n\nIt was a quiet night for Le Normand at the back, but he was a nuisance from set pieces and looked confident when called into action.\n\nCB: Aymeric Laporte - 6/10\n\nAs with Robin Le Normand, not much to do for Laporte defensively as Italy offered little threat.\n\nLB: Marc Cucurella - 7/10\n\nThe Chelsea full-back proved once again why he was chosen in place of Bayer Leverkusen's Grimaldo. A picture perfect left-back display in many ways.\n\nCM: Fabian Ruiz - 7/10\n\nPSG's Fabian Ruiz has been their standout midfielder this tournament, and continued to be a threat from distance. Helped his country dominate the ball.\n\nCM: Rodri - 7/10\n\nA typical Rodri performance, calm and assured. However, his yellow card for talking to the referee will see him be suspended for the final group game.\n\nCM: Pedri:5/10\n\nA harsh rating perhaps, but Pedri's misses could've been costly. On multiple occasions the midfielder should've done better than he did, but did move the ball around well.\n\nRW: Nico Williams - 8/10\n\nOne of the performances of the tournament so far. Williams was electric from the start and was a real throwback to an old school winger. Absolutely superb.\n\nLW: Lamine Yamal - 7/10\n\nThe youngest ever player at the European Championships was outshone by Williams, but was also a constant threat on the opposite flank.\n\nST: Alvaro Morata - 6/10\n\nMorata led his team and the line well, but in crucial areas he took one too many touches which cost him. If not for that, he could've had a couple tonight.\n\nSub: Alex Baena - 5/10\n\nWasn't on long enough to make an impact as Spain were defending more in the final 15 minutes.\n\nSub: Ferran Torres - 5/10\n\nSame as Baena. Fresh legs and little impact further up the pitch.\n\nSub: Ayoze Perez - 6/10\n\nOne for Leicester and Newcastle fans. Perez made sure his short time on the pitch was memorable, producing a beautiful nutmeg and forcing Donnarumma into two smart saves.\n\nSub: Mikel Oyarzabal - 5/10\n\nThe forward had little to do after coming on.\n\nItaly GK: Gianluigi Donnarumma - 7/10\n\nIf not for the Italian number one, this could've been a massacre. Donnarumma was in top form to keep Spain at bay with a number of fine saves.\n\nRB: Giovanni Di Lorenzo - 3/10\n\nDi Lorenzo will be having nightmares about Nico Williams when he goes to sleep tonight. The winger ran circles around the Italian full back all evening.\n\nCB: Alessandro Bastoni - 5/10\n\nNot the Inter Milan star's best night as he too had to deal with the threat of Williams whenever he cut inside. Faired marginally better than Di Lorenzo.\n\nCB: Riccardo Calafiori - 4/10\n\nYou have to feel for Calafiori, who knew nothing about the own goal he scored. However, it was a costly error that in all likelihood has cost his country top spot.\n\nLB: Federico Dimarco - 4/10\n\nJust as torrid a night for Dimarco, who will be glad to see the back of Lamine Yamal.\n\nCM: Nicolo Barella - 5/10\n\nBarella was seen getting increasingly frustrated throughout, and looked the tidiest of Italy's midfielders. Not that it was difficult.\n\nCM: Jorginho - 4/10\n\nYou wouldn't have known that Jorginho was the player of the tournament at the last Euros. He looked completely out of his depth until being dragged off at half-time.\n\nCM: Davide Frattesi - 4/10\n\nAlmost exactly how Jorginho played. This is Frattesi's first international tournament so he gets a pass, but he has to do better in future.\n\nRW: Federico Chiesa - 5/10\n\nOn the break, you could see Chiesa carried threat. It was all too little though from the Juventus man.\n\nLW: Lorenzo Pellegrini - 5/10\n\nWas kept on when others came off, which is a sign that the Roma skipper was slightly more of a threat.\n\nST: Gianluca Scamacca - 4/10\n\nTo be fair to Scamacca, he had no service. Italy didn't play to his strengths and he could do little to turn the game around.\n\nSub: Bryan Cristante - 5/10\n\nThe most notable thing Cristante did was break the record for the fastest yellow card by a substitute in Euros history.\n\nSub: Andrea Cambiaso - 6/10\n\nCambiaso provided energy off the bench and also cleared an effort off the line. A solid cameo.\n\nSub: Mattia Zaccagni - 5/10\n\nProvided energy but no extra quality.\n\nSub: Mateo Retegui - 5/10\n\nUnable to make a major impact.\n\nSub - Giacomo Raspadori - 5/10\n\nUnable to make a major impact.\n\nPlayer of the Match Nico Williams\n\nNico Williams showed the world exactly what he was capable of with an incredible display on the left-hand side. From the first minute, the Athletic Bilbao star showed he was prepared to take the game by the scruff of the neck and turned Di Lorenzo inside and out on multiple ocassions.\n\nThe only thing missing from his incredible display was a goal. Something he came so close to getting when he saw a beautiful effort from the edge of the box smack the frame of the goal. He did flash the cross in for Spain's only goal of the game though, which is the very least he deserved.

So far, it's been a close contest in the battle of human vs AI, so who's going to take home the bragging rights this week? You can see both predictions below.\n\nYou won't be short of options for watching the big game, as various streaming services will be showing it live. The choice of streaming service depends on your location, but you don't really have to be limited by that.\n\nIf you prefer a streaming service from a different location, you can always change your virtual location with a streaming Virtual Private Network (VPN) such as PureVPN.\n\nHere's a list of different streaming services to pick from.\n\nITVX is our pick as the best streaming service for watching Spain vs. Italy. First, it's free. The UK broadcast license funds the service, which streams EURO 2024 matches for free alongside BBC iPlayer.\n\nSo what's the catch?\n\nWell, it's not much of a catch, as you can easily work around it. First, you will need to be in the UK. But if you're not, PureVPN can help, as it offers servers in London and Manchester.\n\nThe other is that you will need to create an account to stream a video. This part is free, but the streaming service will ask for a UK postal code. It doesn't have to be an actual one, so you can search online for random UK postcodes.\n\nTVNZ+ is the second-best option for most fans as it's free and in English. Creating an account doesn't require a payment method or postal code. All you need is an email, and you'll get access to all 51 EURO 2024 games, including the Spain vs. Italy live stream.\n\nIf you are outside New Zealand and want to access the streaming service, simply get a top VPN and connect to a server in the country.\n\nIn the US, the Fox Network will broadcast Spain vs Italy. The best options to get these two in the region are Fubo TV and Sling TV, which also offer hundreds of other channels.\n\nSling TV is the cheaper option, as Sling Blue offers Fox Channels, and it costs $22.5 for the first month. That said, Fubo TV has a 7-day free trial, so it's technically free to watch Spain vs. Italy. If you wish to cancel, you won't be charged. Otherwise, prices start at $79.99.\n\nZDF (Germany) and Servus TV (Austria) will also offer a free Spain vs Italy live stream. The best thing about these two is that you don't even need to create an account to watch the game. All you need is to be in the specific countries, but you can also use PureVPN to connect to an appropriate server if you are not. Note that the two broadcast in German.\n\nSpain and Italy have a rich history in international football. In fact, they've won a combined 5 of the 16 EURO tournaments.\n\nHowever, they've also gone through some patches in recent history, such as defending champions Italy not qualifying for the last two consecutive World Cup tournaments. Both teams also lack a genuine goal scorer, and it will be interesting to see how they'll deal with that.\n\nSpain is still in a transition period, as this is the first tournament under new manager Luis de la Fuente. However, he already knows the players well, and his possession-based playing style has improved.\n\nOne of the biggest talking points of the team is Barcelona's 16-year-old extraordinary talent, Lamine Yamal. You can expect the teenager to start, and if he scores, he'll be the youngest-ever goal scorer at the Euros. He is already the youngest player to play in the tournament after the Albania game.\n\nAlthough he is the headline, the team's engine is none other than Manchester City's Rodri. He is the de facto leader and has some of the best talents around him -- Martin Zubimendi, Fabia Ruiz, Pedri, and Nico Williams.\n\nHowever, like Italy, La Roja (The Reds) is also lacking in the striking department. Alvaro Morata is the go-to man, but he has only scored thrice since March. Joselu is his backup and has played the same role well for Real Madrid, but he doesn't have the international credentials.\n\nThat said, De La Fuente's team has adapted well to the lack of a proper striker, and they've performed quite well in recent years. They reached the semifinals of EURO 2020 despite being knocked out by eventual champions Italy via penalties.\n\nSince then, they've proven to be EURO 2024 contenders by winning the UEFA Nations League in 2023, beating group B rivals Croatia and Italy. Their EURO qualification was also quite impressive, winning 7 and only losing 1 to win their group. You can expect them to be real contenders and control the match against Italy.\n\nItaly came into the tournament as the defending champions, having won it in 2021 at Euro 2020. However, it's not an overstatement to say that aura isn't there anymore.\n\nLess than a year after their glorious night in Wembley, they failed to qualify for the 2022 Qatar World Cup. And in what manner? By losing their playoff semifinal to football minnows North Macedonia.\n\nTheir qualification to this tournament was also nothing to write home about. They only won 1 of their first three tournaments, although they managed to get three wins in four matches under new Luciano Spaletti (long-term manager Mancini resigned after the first two games).\n\nIn the final group game, Gli Azzurri (The Blues) secured a tense goalless draw against Ukraine to avoid dropping to the playoffs. Since then, they have won three of their four friendlies. However, there are some major issues coming to the tournament.\n\nThe biggest issue is that they have no recognized striker. Gianluca Scamacca is the man they'll rely on, and he was decent for Europa League winners Atalanta. However, he has scored just once in the 16 games he has played for Italy. The second option is Giacomo Raspadori of Napoli, but he has only scored 5 goals over the last Seria A season.\n\nIn addition, Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo and forward Domenico Berardi are not available due to injury. Long-term midfielders Marco Verratti and Lorenzo Insigne are also not options as they no longer play in Europe.\n\nSo what does this mean for the match?\n\nWell, you can expect Italy to use their defense as their form of attack. They'll try to hold off Spain, and we can say that they have the defending personnel to do that. But can it work throughout the game and tournament?\n\nHere's a quick look at how the two teams have fared against each other over the last ten matches.\n\nAs you can see, Spain holds a significant advantage with four wins against Italy's one. The other five have been draws, with both teams winning one apiece in the elimination stages of tournaments. Spain is in the Confederation Cup, Italy is in EURO 2020.\n\nHere is how things stand after Gameweek 1.\n\nOne thing you can enjoy about EURO 2024 is that it's available in every region.\n\nHowever, all EURO 2024 streaming services use geo-restrictions. This means that if you are outside a particular region for whatever reason, you won't access the region's streaming service. For example, ITVX is only available to users in the UK, while Sling TV is only available in the US.\n\nThis means that if you have a subscription and have traveled, you are left at a disadvantage despite paying. The same applies if you simply want to avoid the cost and use a free streaming service from a different region.\n\nThis shouldn't worry you, though.\n\nYou can always use a VPN to bypass these restrictions. A VPN works by hiding your IP address and giving you one located in the region where the VPN server is. And since your IP address carries your location information, this becomes your new virtual location.\n\nOne last thing, though -- streaming services such as ITVX know about this trick and block streams when they detect you are using a VPN. This means that you need to choose yours carefully to avoid streaming issues.\n\nThe best VPN to stream Spain vs Italy is one that optimizes its servers to avoid VPN blocks. But even besides that, it needs to offer speeds that are good enough to enjoy live games without buffering. You also have to consider privacy and security.\n\nAll that requires lots of analysis, but we have done the hard work for you and created a shortlist of the best VPNs for streaming Spain vs Italy.\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nPureVPN stands out as the best VPN to watch the Spain vs Italy match in Euro 2024 due to its exceptional streaming capabilities and friendly price.\n\nThe main highlight of the VPN is that it comes with dedicated streaming servers, meaning you won't have to deal with trial and error. If you want to watch ITVX, simply choose the ITVX server, and the VPN will give you access.\n\nThis streaming list is part of a larger server network that consists of 6,500+ VPN servers spread across 80+ locations in 65+ countries.

Yamal's turn away from Demarco was a thing of beauty, matched by his driving run into the box before poking in to Morata.\n\nDonnarumma was equal to the task as the former Chelsea striker worked an angle to shoot.\n\nAnd the Italy captain saved his side once again with a flying leap and top hand stop to turn Fabian Ruiz' rising 25-yarder behind for a corner.\n\nIt felt as if a Spain opener was inevitable as the Italian back line rocked under the punches being thrown, blows to open them up for the potential knock-out, with di Lorenzo enduring a torrid night at the hands of Williams.\n\nTime and again, just as they seemed set to break, Italy found a block, a tackle, a barge, hoping against hope that the storm would eventually subside, Donnarumma holding firm under fire from Fabian once more.\n\nAt the break, despite parity, the Italians were shaking their heads as if they were seeking answers.\n\nLuciano Spalletti sought to find them by hooking Jorginho and Davide Frattesi, although Bryan Cristante's first act was to pick up a booking for a naughty foot-cruncher on Rodri.\n\nNot that it stopped Spain, who were only missing the finishing touch.\n\nPedri was wasteful again when he side-footed wide from 10 yards after glorious interplay between Williams and Marc Cucurella had sliced Italy apart once more.\n\nBut if Spain could not find a way past the holders, Italy would do it for them.\n\nWilliams, once more, destroyed Di Lorenzo, Morata got a flick and Donnarumma's desperate lunge only diverted against Califiori's left knee and back over the line.\n\nUnlike some teams we could mention, Spain did not sit back on their lead.\n\nDonnarumma denied Morata's long-ranger, with half-time replacement Andrea Cambiaso hooking Robin Le Normand's header off the line from the resulting corner.\n\nAs the Spanish fans roared, Yamal was a whisker wide before Williams cut it from the left to send the angle of post and bar shuddering after a stunning strike that left even Donnarumma for dead.\n\nThey only lacked a second to put the game to bed, Donnarumma making two more great saves to foil late sub Ayoze Perez in stoppage time.\n\nYet the gulf in class was cavernously wide. And the real worry for England, Germany and the rest, is that these Spaniards are only going to improve over the years to come.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Before the draw was made, the Spain captain insists he was convinced the seleccion would get Italy. They always do and, although this is a special match for a striker whose wife Alice is Italian, who spent four years at Juventus across two spells and who may go back for a third, a game he says he can't wait to play, it is also one that sadly, his family will not attend and one that doesn't always end well. This is his third European Championship, the competition in which only Michel Platini and Cristiano Ronaldo have scored more; until now, they have all been ended by the same team.\n\nRelated: 'A total killer': How Dani Carvajal found an unexpected scoring touch\n\nIt's personal, and it's painful. In 2016, his friends Leonardo Bonucci, Andrea Barzagli and Giorgio Chiellini warned him to wear a helmet, then dumped Spain out in Paris. Five years later, he scored the opening goal in the semi-final at Wembley, but then missed the seleccion's last penalty. \"And who knows what would have happened had we won that shootout,\" he says. Spain beat Italy in the semi-finals of the past two Nations Leagues, reacquainted with victory but Wembley remains, something to drive them, a vendetta. It is, in his words, still \"nailed\" into them: a dagger in their side, yet to be pulled out.\n\nMorata says they \"have to treat this like a knockout\", but it is not. Eighth against ninth in the world rankings, it is though the first round's biggest game and will go a long way to defining the group of death, opening a path towards a final. And this match always matters, a meeting of history and symbolism. These countries have met 40 times; this will be the fifth Euros running and the fourth encounter in three years.\n\nAt Euro 2012 they played each other twice, in the group and the final, which could yet happen here. That night in Kyiv, Spain won 4-0 to close the most successful cycle ever seen, a symmetry to it all; it had begun against Italy too, the shootout victory on their way to the title in 2008 a kind of exorcism, injustice avenged. Eighty-eight winless years were washed away, fatalism gone. It was only a quarter-final but Fernando Torres described it as the night they won their first trophy in 44 years. It would, he said, be \"mythical for generations\". Few games capture the imagination quite like it, maybe not even the World Cup final.\n\nNothing though is for ever, not success and not even the narrative. 2008 came with a kind of moral quality: the image of the rivalry in Spain had been Luis Enrique's bloodied face, victim of Mauro Tassotti's elbow at USA 94. In their style, they claimed something purer, lasting; this was a rivalry supposedly built on contrasting identities, tika-taka vs catenaccio. There was a nice line from the Italy manager, Luciano Spalletti, this week about how if modernity means staying up to 4am playing on the console, it is not always a good thing - \"we come here to win the Euros not Call of Duty,\" he said - but generations change and old assumptions, old cliches, are undone.\n\nInstead, there is a kind of convergence, these two more like each other than before. It's not just Italy and Spain, it is everyone, and it was always overplayed, anyway. But perhaps here it is expressed more clearly than anywhere else, and if there is something upon which Spain are insisting: it is that they have evolved. It is a line they have consciously pushed since Luis de la Fuente took over from Luis Enrique after the Qatar World Cup, and it sometimes felt a little forced, but against Croatia it did come into focus.\n\nIn Berlin, Spain \"lost\" the possession battle for the first time in 136 competitive games, the coach talking about versatility, knowing how to compete, defend and counter. The way Italy always would. \"You have to start with the fact that Croatia want the ball too, but we interpreted very well what moment of the game we were in, how to find space and a free man,\" the goalkeeper Unai Sim\u00f3n said. \"You don't need to have the ball so much if you're a team like ours with speed,\" De la Fuente said, two young, exciting wingers, aged 21 and 16, providing a new twist: \"if they're running into the area a lot, that frightens the opponents; it frightens them a lot,\" Sim\u00f3n said.\n\nThey do not shy from it. \"Times have changed; they're uninhibited: they talk a lot they joke a lot, you don't have to tell them anything,\" Morata said. Just make the most of them. \"Recently the national team is playing a bit more direct with me and Nico [Williams],\" Lamine Yamal said. \"We go into space, we're not have the ball so much. Having wingers like us helps the team to have space and be able to go long.\"\n\n\"In the first quarter of an hour against Croatia it was the Spain we'd seen our whole lives, then we went direct, then we played again,\" Morata told Marca. \"For other teams we're quite unpredictable. If I were our coach I would go to bed with my head about to explode because there are 26 players and they could all play. I imagine the Italy coach asking himself: How are this lot going to play against me? False 9? Wingers coming inside to combine? Wingers going beyond? We change our way of playing various times. We're much stronger than at the last Euros.

It was a travesty of a scoreline for an unbelievably impressive performance from Spain, who could quite easily have won 5-0 without anyone thinking it was harsh on Italy.\n\nIt was absurd that the only goal was an own goal, too, although it does point to some familiar Spanish failings in terms of being unable to convert dominance into goals. Perhaps that will come back to haunt them in the knockout stage. But that's for a later date.\n\nFor now, let's marvel in probably the most cohesive performance of Euro 2024 thus far, when taking into account the quality of the opposition.\n\nAfter all, over the last couple of decades, Spain versus Italy has been arguably the main battleground in European Championships. They have faced one another in 2008, twice in 2012, 2016, 2020 and now in 2024. They are the only two nations to have won both the World Cup and the European Championship in the last 20 years. And, most pertinently, they've always been very different footballing nations.\n\nSome European nations go together neatly in football terms, but Spain and Italy are like oil and water. Returning to the first couple of questions, there's been a sense that Spanish football has somewhat looked down on Italian football in recent decades, considering its football defensive, tactical and old-fashioned. Therefore, Spanish players haven't ventured to Italy, and Spanish clubs haven't signed Italians.\n\nAs Spain's dominance of European football around 15 years ago became clear, they partly became the template for Italy. This was always a slightly controversial topic: some Italians are traditionalists, and want to compete as typical Italian sides. But they won the last European Championship under Roberto Mancini with a likeable brand of football, and the reigns of Cesare Prandelli, from 2010 to 2014, and Luciano Spalletti, since last year, introduced more positive coaches.\n\nThe Spanish influence has been notable by their use of multiple midfield playmakers. Prandelli often used Andrea Pirlo, Thiago Motta, Daniele De Rossi and Claudio Marchisio together. Mancini could depend on both Marco Verratti and Jorginho. That was the Spanish way.\n\n\"We must take the initiative,\" said Spalletti in his press conference yesterday. \"We must have courage to play the ball,\" agreed left-back Federico Dimarco. With Jorginho and Nico Barella in the engine room, perhaps Italy could compete.\n\nBut Spain have moved away from that approach of cramming as many playmakers into the side as possible. Whereas they once used David Silva and Andres Iniesta from the flanks -- essentially bonus No 10s -- now they use electric wingers.\n\nLuis Enrique was sacked after the World Cup 18 months ago, in part, because it was felt his obsession with possession play was too predictable. Luis de la Fuente's reign has been characterised by the idea that Spain are now more direct. In their opener against Croatia, they recorded less than 50% of possession in a competitive game for the first time since Euro 2008. It's about 'modernisation' and 'verticality'.\n\nAnd that verticality was obvious here, through their wingers. Down the left, Nico Williams produced the best individual performance of the tournament so far. Inside two minutes, he bamboozled Giovanni Di Lorenzo and crossed for a header that Pedro should have buried.\n\nEvery time Williams collected the ball, Di Lorenzo looked terrified, to the extent that Williams even beat him in the air at one point, which produced a wild Di Lorenzo hack to bring him down.\n\nHis fellow defender Alessandro Bastoni did the same thing shortly afterwards, almost out of sympathy. Di Lorenzo is not a flashy full-back -- he's in the side to be solid. And when your solid full-back gets beaten like this, time and time again, you know you're in trouble.\n\nOn the other flank, Dimarco didn't fare much better against Lamine Yamal, the competition's youngest player. Yamal dribbled inside to create a fine chance for Alvaro Morata. Later he cut inside and grazed the far post with a curling effort, which seemed to inspire Williams to do the same, cutting inside from the left onto his right foot and smashing the ball against the woodwork.\n\nThis genuinely felt like a new Spain, using more of an old-school Dutch-style 4-3-3, with wingers that wanted to take on their man, that could go inside or out, that could cross or dribble.\n\nWilliams' good work could have produced various goals, particularly when he dribbled at Di Lorenzo, who was scared to commit and backed off, allowing Williams to poke the ball inside for Marc Cucurella's underlapping run and cut-back. Somehow, Pedri sidefooted wide.\n\nEventually the goal came from a menacing Williams dribble, and his cross was deflected into the path of the unfortunate Riccardo Calafiori, who turned the ball into his own net, for yet another Euro 2024 own goal.\n\nItaly now produce Spain-style midfield passers but they still don't really produce wingers. Federico Chiesa, one of the revelations of the last European Championship, is perhaps a rare exception, although he also feels like a shooter rather than a dribbler from wide, much like his father Enrico, a fine second striker at the turn of the century.\n\nItalian wide players tend to be hard workers; tactically disciplined players who get through lots of running and allow the central players to shine. They don't stretch the play or beat a man. It felt typical that even Spalletti, an adventurous coach, felt minded to introduce Andrea Cambiaso -- a versatile, jack-of-all-trades wide player -- to double up against the brilliant Williams and shut him down. That's your Italian wide player. Not, of course, that he managed to stop Williams either.\n\nFor the first time, this really feels like a new era of Spain, a post-tiki-taka world, with Yamal and Williams the stars. In midfield, Rodri is another Sergio Busquets, Pedri grew up admiring Iniesta, and Fabian Ruiz is an assured, solid left-footed passer. More of that type of Spain. But now there's also speed, width, risk-taking and excitement.\n\nTonight, they were on a different planet to Italy. As always, these two footballing nations always feel very separate.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

As Spalletti said during a pre-match press conference on Wednesday, the Azzurri want to \"show a crazy desire to prove we are also an important [footballing] school\", arguing that Spain are one of the best countries in the world when it comes to footballing identity.\n\nSpalletti stressed that Italy would try to \"dominate proceedings,\" knowing that, however, they wouldn't necessarily keep possession for longer than their opponents.\n\n\"Sometimes we may attack and other times we may be forced to defend in our own half, but the idea is always to try to play football,\" said the CT.\n\n\"Spain became Spain and their school of football is known because they've always played the same brand. That's how they became so recognisable,\" argued the ex-Napoli boss.\n\n\"They did so because they were able to maintain the same football philosophy. We often talk about international football and different schools of thought, some more defined by schools than Italy. In order to get to that stage, you need to follow Spain's playbook. Come up with the same philosophy again and again.\"\n\nHistorically, the Italian and the Spanish philosophies have always been quite different. The Azzurri's football was mostly based on strong defence, a low block and counter-attacks while Pep Guardiola has inspired Spain's tiki-taka style over the last 15 years, with the country reaching the summit of world football.\n\nHowever, Spalletti doesn't want to leave the ball to Luis de la Fuente's boys this time. He wants to play on par with La Roja.\n\n\"We want to test ourselves against the top sides like Spain to see where we are at in terms of performance levels,\" he said.\n\n\"We try to play a positive brand of football and keep possession. I believe if you give the opposition the ball, you'll come away the worst of the two. We'll try to dominate proceedings from time to time. We'll see if we'll do a good enough job to do so.\"\n\nThis is exactly the point.\n\nCan Italy play a better brand of football than Spain? Can they dominate possession against one of the best teams in this regard, perhaps the best in Europe?\n\nThe Azzurri had the same dilemma three years ago when they qualified for the European Championship semifinals against Spain through convincing performances during the group stage and the knock-out phase. However, the opening ten minutes against La Roja at Wembley Stadium were enough to understand they had to switch to the old style if they wanted to emerge victorious.\n\nOne player on the pitch that night, Federico Bernardeschi, has described the game as \"probably the toughest one\" he's ever played and even Spalletti noted that the Azzurri will need to \"make progress before we can play the same brand of football [as Spain].\"\n\nSpalletti's predecessor, Mancini, failed to beat Spain in terms of playing style three years ago, but he eventually brought Italy to the EURO 2020 Final thanks to a win on penalties.

Our lads are strong individually, they just need to play together and accumulate 'battles' on the pitch. I am confident about their qualities and the ability of the coach.\n\n\"I really liked the way Italy faced the game tactically, building up with a three-man defence with Di Lorenzo, Calafiori, and Bastoni promoted to the leader of central defence without Acerbi,\" he continued.\n\n\"All this, with the ability to defend with four men, Dimarco on the left and Di Lorenzo on the right, so that our most talented player in one-v-one, Chiesa, would not waste energies with defensive duties.\"\n\nThe Azzurri are not favourites against Spain, but the convincing performance against Albania suggests it may not be a bad idea to look to the Nazionale through some great sweepstakes casino options.\n\n\"Italy dominated the possession against Albania and I am convinced we will play our brand of football when we have the ball against Spain. But beware of opponents,\" said Stramaccioni.\n\n\"We'll face the best ones when it comes to building up. Rodri, Fabian Ruiz, and Pedri impressed me in the opening match, and they have two superb wingers, Williams and Yamal. I see a much more practical Spain than the last World Cup and less sterile. It will be a meaningful test for our national team.\"\n\nThe first EURO 2024 round ended on Tuesday with Portugal's 2-1 win over Czechia and Stramaccioni named the two teams he has enjoyed the most so far.\n\n\"It's just the first round, so it's still quite early to judge,\" he admitted.\n\n\"Surely, aside from Italy, I liked Germany's defensive blocks. Andrich has given them a defensive stability that they seemed to be lacking in the past.

That Spain came to the German capital of gridlock and found the most fluent performance of Euro 2024 was doubly impressive. Coming mere hours after the tournament's favourites plumbed new depths and arriving against the reigning champions means multiplying its significance a couple times more.\n\nLuis de la Fuente's side, tantalising in attack, balanced and cohesive in the middle and thus far solid at the back, are motoring away from Gelsenkirchen, as impressive as any feat. The first team through to the last 16, the scoresheet saying progress came courtesy of a Riccardo Calafiori second-half own goal. It didn't. It came from Nico Williams who tormented Giovanni Di Lorenzo and Italy at large, serving up a stunning performance to match the one his counterpart on the other wing, teenager Lamine Yamal, provided against Croatia.\n\nHow far can they go? We can't yet say but we do know it will be worth the watch. Two games, two wins, four scored, none conceded and plenty of other numbers looking good for La Roja.\n\nThe tournament had reached its 18th game without a traditional scoreless draw, which is to say, one which finishes with the scoreboard untroubled. Yet the contest which preceded this, Gareth Southgate's latest masterpiece in under-delivery, was as spiritual a 0-0 as you'd see. Which meant Spain and Italy could get on with things knowing the scoreless fates weren't hovering above them.\n\nFamiliarity is supposed to breed contempt yet these are two blue bloods of the continent who mostly shrug and get on with meeting one another every four years, serving up some classics \u2011 and a couple of duds too. This was the fifth-straight Euros where the two met, including two get-togethers in 2012. Opening-day victories coupled with Croatia's draw with Albania Tuesday meant the pressure felt a little off. No one told Williams.\n\nThe real stresses were for the masses who made their way out to this place, which proved a nightmarish logistical location for England and Serbia fans on Sunday night - and into Monday morning. By kickoff here, the stands were packed again but, like a North Rhein industrial wasteland version of Hotel California, checking in isn't the problem.\n\nIt was however, essentially, the problem for Italy first time around when they arrived asleep, Albania taking all of 23 seconds to fire in a stunning opener. To their credit, Luciano Spaletti's side waited five times' as long to check in at AufSchalke Arena, Pedri unable to do what Nadim Bajrami had as the Barcelona midfielder headed Williams' cross at Gianluigi Donnarumma when he simply had to score. The clock hadn't hit two minutes but it was a sign of what was to come.\n\nThe minutes on the arena's giant scoreboard ticked along but somehow in an utterly dominant first half hour, the digit beside the word 'Spain' didn't. Williams was tormenting Di Lorenzo, slicing and dicing on the right. After 10 minutes he floated central and was found by a gorgeous Alvaro Morata cross. Like Pedri, he had to score. Unlike Pedri, he couldn't even hit the target, skewing his head wide.\n\nWhen Yamal found a groove on the opposite wing, Italy really had to start worrying, surely? The teenager turned beautifully after 23 minutes and jinked in to create an opening which Morata couldn't build on. Three minutes later Fabian Ruiz rifled a drive which Gianluigi Donnarumma tipped over. Closer to half-time the PSG midfielder would try again but hilariously fire the ball halfway back to town, beating the rush for the tram.\n\nRuiz was buzzing and Rodri was doing a lot of his metronome thing, Jorginho having as enjoyable a Wednesday as clubmate Declan Rice. Spain's defence was just as dominant, the last shot of the half Italy's sole effort, Federicho Chiesa firing well over. As the teams made their way off you assumed Di Lorenzo would fish out a number for Scotland's Anthony Ralston to start a tormented right backs club.\n\nThe two downsides of the first half for Spain were the lack of a goal and a yellow card for Rodri which ruled him out of the final group game. But if they could sort out the first problem, the second one would disappear. Spaletti tried to sort his own mess, removing Jorginho and the equally anonymous Davide Frattesi but Bryan Cristante came in and found Rodri's foot and a yellow card within 21 seconds. Hardly promising.\n\nWhat had been promised for so long finally arrived ten minutes into the half. That it came from Williams' wing was about the most reliable thing in this city. He jinked past Di Lorenzo yet again and sent a fizzing ball across which Morata got a flicker of hair on. Donnarumma's touch was even more slight but enough to leave Calafiori helpless. The scoreline finally ticked where it should have been much sooner.\n\nThe chances for it tick again flowed freely now: Robin Le Normand having a header cleared off the line and Yamal trying to spellbind one inside the post from distance. Spaletti made two more changes because why not? A wake-up call did arrive when Cristante surged forward and sent one across the Spanish goal on 67 minutes. Soon after Williams cut in from his side and crashed one emphatically off the woodwork.\n\nItaly, beyond belatedly, provided a little something. Not much, not nearly enough but something. Aymeric Laporte and the Spanish defence, the lingering not-yet-known, tired a little. But they saw it out, Ayoze Perez botching two late chances en route. No matter. Rodri can rest up. Plenty of road to travel yet.\n\nSPAIN (4-3-3): Unai Simon 7; Carvajal 7, Le Normand 7, Laporte 7, Cucurella 7; Pedri 7 (Baena 71), Rodri 8, Ruiz 8 (Merino 90); Yamal 8 (Torres 71), Morata 7

If you don't react at the same speed, it all becomes more difficult,\" Spalletti told Sky Sport Italia.\n\n\"When it's Spain who have this ability to target you quickly, it becomes doubly difficult. It is a simple analysis, they were quicker than us in their choices, in their pressing, in working together and it all comes down to the fact we weren't as sharp as them.\n\n\"When the legs don't move and you don't have the right distances between players, character can only take you so far. We were always stretched out and every time we won the ball back, we lost it again.\n\n\"Our choices were not precise, our reaction was always a bit lacking in logic.\"\n\nAll is not lost, as though Spain are through to the Round of 16 as group winners, a point against Croatia would be sufficient to guarantee second place for Italy.\n\nThis is because even if Albania beat Spain in the other match, the Nazionale have a superior head-to-head record.\n\n\"We need to recover, be capable of reasoning the right way on the situations we saw today. At times we could've made different tactical decisions and kept the team tighter, but they were moving far quicker than us, reacting far quicker. The difference was too clear,\" continued Spalletti.\n\nIs it purely a physical issue that Italy lack sharpness compared to Spain, who only made one change from their opening game?\n\n\"I consider it to be a physical situation, as psychologically we were in good shape, coming off a good performance. We were up against a team that plays good football and we should've showed we were just as good on the ball, but instead they were much more reactive. That is what caused the problems.\"\n\nItaly went behind after 23 seconds against Albania and Donnarumma had to make a save after 90 seconds, so Spalletti was asked why do they start so badly?\n\n\"As time goes on, you start to lose your shape, lose sight of why you were making those decisions. Jorginho, Barella and others are good at making those choices, but we were probably struggling to defend because we made that attempt to control the game and have the same possession as Spain. We didn't manage it and that made everything more difficult.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciano_Spalletti", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luciano Spalletti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccardo_Calafiori", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riccardo Calafiori"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianluigi_Donnarumma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gianluigi Donnarumma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sport_(Italy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sport (Italy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorginho_(footballer,_born_December_1991)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jorginho (footballer, born December 1991)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol\u00f2_Barella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicol\u00f2 Barella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Education", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Education", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Academic Departments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Publications", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/football_italia_articles_132/c4fbc88f6758df1179abf5c50da84b6c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661646", "eventUri": "eng-9661646", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

It took more to disrupt the fine Spanish mechanics who ended up concretizing their clear domination in the 55th minute thanks to a new flash from Williams: after yet another overflow, his fleeing cross was propelled into his own goal by Riccardo Calafiori.\n\nThis goal and two new substitutions ended up slightly waking up Italy, in vain, who had lost their two previous duels with Spain (in the semi-finals of the League of nations 2021 and 2023).\n\nSpalletti's Italy who had already lost their only match played against a nation in the world's top 10 (3-1 against England in Euro qualifiers -2024) completely failed its first test of importance.

Italy but only had a solitary goal to show for it as they secured top-spot in Group B in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nSpain bossed the opening 45 minutes and Pedri and Nico Williams spurned fine chances to break the deadlock while Gianluigi Donnarumma was in inspired form in the Italian goal.\n\nNine minutes after the break Riccardo Calafiori scored an unfortunate own-goal from a Williams cross but try as they might Spain could not find a second as while Pedri missed another sitter and Williams thumped the woodwork while Donnarumma would simply not be beaten.\n\nItaly mustered a little late pressure but now face a crunch clash with Croatia on Monday to determine who will go through to the last-16 as runners-up.\n\nPedri should have put Spain ahead inside two minutes when he was left unmarked in the middle to meet Nico Williams' perfect cross from the left but his header was too close to Gianluigi Donnarumma who made a flying fingertip save.\n\nWilliams was giving right-back Giovanni Di Lorenzo a torrid time on the left flank but himself missed a sitter from an inswinging cross from Alvaro Morata on 10 minutes, ghosting towards the back post but sending his close range header flashing past the near upright in plenty of space.\n\nLamine Yemal slalomed his way into the box before feeding Morata who was driven wide before seeing an angled shot blocked by the feet of Donnarumma and moments later the keeper flew to his right to tip over a rasping long-range drive from Fabian Ruiz on 25 minutes.\n\nThe Spain pressure was unrelenting and Rodri first dragged a low shot wide of target and then saw a first-time strike blocked by Alessandro Bastoni after some slick approach play.\n\nBastoni came to the rescue with a timely intervention to prevent Williams from latching onto a reverse pass from Pedri in the box while Fabian Ruiz whipped a first-time effort straight down the throat of Donnarumma five minutes before the break.\n\nItaly launched a rare foray forward before the interval but after being found on the right flank by Nicolo Barella's first time pass, Federico Chiesa drove towards the box before lashing high and wide.\n\nHalf-time sub Bryan Cristante - on in place of Jorginho - went into the book for a lunge on Rodri within 20 seconds of the second-half kicking-off - the fastest ever booking for a sub at a European Championships.\n\nPedri spurned another glorious chance when Marc Cucurella cut back from the left byline only for the Barcelona man to side-foot past the near post with the goal at his mercy.\n\nPedri then fired straight at Donnarumma from distance but the deadlock was broken moments later when Williams danced to the byline and fired in a cross which glanced off Morata's head and flicked the palm of Donnarumma, only diverting the ball into the knee of Calafiori who could not avoid turning the ball into his own net from close range.\n\nMorata stung the palms of Donnarumma as the onslaught continued and Andrea Cambiasso had to hook a header from Robin Le Normand off the line before 16-year-old Yamal curled narrowly wide from 25 yards.\n\nA rare Italian break saw Cristante flash a cross low across the face of goal but normal service resumed as Williams whipped a curling effort from the corner of the area which cannoned off the angle of post and bar with Donnarumma well beaten.\n\nInside the final 20 minutes Lorenzo Pellegrini floated a 25-yard free-kick over the crossbar, failin to trouble Unai Simon, who was largely a spectator throughout.\n\nAymeric Laporte - who was a fitness doubt before kick-off - nodded over an Alex Baena corner as Spain sought to put the result beyond doubt.\n\nTheir inability to put the game to bed saw Italy piling on some late pressure with Cristante's near-post flick from a corner being held by Unai Simon on 86 minutes.\n\nAyoze Perez was the last to be denied by Donnarumma after firstly tricking his way into the box and moments later latching onto a through-ball, but the keeper produced two fine low stops to deny him in a surely universal man of the match performance, though his attempt to score a dramatic equaliser at the other end from a stoppage-time corner was unsuccessful.\n\nSpain face Albania in Dusseldorf while Italy face Croatia in a winner-takes-all clash for runners-up spot in Leipzig on Monday night.",

We've got you covered. Spain vs Italy is free on ITV1/ITVX in the UK. Brit abroad? Use a VPN to watch Euro 2024 free from anywhere.\n\nIf you didn't think three-time winners Spain were clinical enough to do some damage at Euro 2024, then La Roja's 3-0 demolition of 2018 World Cup runners-up Croatia served notice of the hitherto latent firepower that lurks within. Goals from much-maligned captain \u00c1lvaro Morata, Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz and the increasingly prolific Dani Carvajal did the job, with 16-year-old genius Lamine Yamal a constant threat. Luis de la Fuente's side now have the toughest of tests.\n\nDefending champions Italy couldn't have started Euro 2024 in a less auspicious manner. One down to Albania after 23 seconds after Federico Dimarco's errant throw-in, the Azzurri recovered impressively through Alessandro Bastoni and a cracker from the irrepressible Nicol\u00f2 Barella to open their tournament defence with a 2-1 win. Italy have been frequent vanquishers of Spain in this tournament - and did for them three years ago - so can head coach Luciano Spalletti do it again?\n\nSpain vs Italy is free on ITV1/ITVX for viewers in the UK. Outside the UK? No problem. If you're travelling abroad and want to tune into ITVX as normal, you can use a VPN so that you don't get blocked by the broadcaster.\n\nA Virtual Private Network (VPN), assuming it complies with your broadcaster's T&Cs, creates a private connection between your device and t'internet, meaning the service can't work out where you are and will let you watch.

They're now gearing up for a tense but key clash with Luciano Spalletti's Azzurri, who beat Albania 2-1 in their opening game.\n\nThe match in Gelsenkirchen is expected to be a cagey affair and a draw could be a satisfying result for both teams, considering that Croatia drew with Albania in the other second-round match of Group B, leaving those two sides on a single point in the group.\n\nSpeaking on page 13 of today's Tuttosport, Casillas first discussed his thoughts on the European Championship so far.\n\n\"For now, I've been impressed by the fact that Germany won so easily, scoring so many goals, against Scotland, and then repeated it, albeit less easily, against Hungary.\n\n\"I was also struck by Spain's 3-0 win over Croatia, which obviously encourages me as a Spanish fan that I obviously am. As for the rest, perhaps I wasn't so impressed, but Italy, England and France also caught my attention.\"\n\nHe was asked if this Spain side could go on to win Euro 2024 and his thoughts about the game against Italy.\n\n\"I don't know, there is still a lot of competition to play. Now we have to play against Italy. I think it's a more complicated and tougher match than the one against Croatia.\n\n\"To tell you the truth, the match against the Croatians was also a bit complex, with our rivals trying to recover, but in the end they were unlucky. Let's see how Spain will act in the next match. It's here against Italy that we'll really measure our strength.\"\n\nCasillas expects things to heat up in the knockout stages of the tournament.\n\n\"It hasn't reached the maximum level of passion yet. From the quarter-finals onwards we'll really see the best teams compete, after this group stage and the Round of 16, we'll have a lot of fun there.\n\n\"I have always loved this competition and I really like it when only eight national teams remain, fighting to win the European Championship.\"\n\nCasillas gave his thoughts on the progress and talent of Lamine Yamal.\n\n\"Only he'll be able to demonstrate that he can become a great player, only him, with confidence and commitment. It's great to see how young players continue to emerge in football. In Spain they are considered the stars of the future.\n\n\"They are good for the whole team. Let's see if Yamal, with the confidence and maturity that he has, together with the support of his teammates, can become a top player for Spain.\"\n\nFinally, Casillas discussed how Manuel Neuer is still continuing to impress with Germany.\n\n\"He is a reference point, the veteran goalkeeper of the competition. This is what could've happened to me and Gigi Buffon.

match running, but a tremendous one-hand save from Gianluigi Donnarumma smothered Pedri profiting Nico Williams' cross.\n\nThe roles were reserved ten minutes played where Williams this time got in a decent scoring position to meet a cross-field ball from Alvaro Morata, but he nodded wide from the back-post.\n\nItaly battled to get any sort of rhythm in attack going, and saw La Roja launch another threat when a powerful drive from range by Fabian Ruiz stung the gloves of Donnarumma.\n\nMorata, who was extremely lively across the front three, looked to get one in after coming from the blind-side but Donnarumma noted the danger and rushed out to parry him.\n\nAfter a torrid opening half, the Azzurri saw it fit to change the on-field personnel and in came Bryan Cristante for Jorginho before Davide Frattesi made way for Andrea Cambiaso.\n\nSpain continued to have the lion share of chances after the break and saw Pedri tuck wide from close-range off a cutback from the left of the area.\n\nLa Roja eventually got the breakthrough ten minutes to halftime as a flick-on by Morata from Williams' cross forced Riccardo Calafiori to bundle into his own net from close-range.\n\nWilliams stayed at the heart of every Spain attack in the latter stages where he came in from the left of the area to cut inside and rattle the top of the crossbar.\n\nThe Azzurri's rare foray came moments later when Lorenzo Pellegrini lined-up just outside the area to execute a free-kick, but ended going over the top.\n\nSpain missed a succession of chances to increase their tally courtesy of Ayoze Perez, but solid goalkeeping from Donnarumma kept him out.\n\nAlthough, it didn't matter a great deal as La Roja had done just about enough to see out the win which confirmed their last 16 spot,

Their opponents in the group drew in a thrilling 2-2 encounter on Tuesday, setting things up nicely for tonight's match.\n\nBack in Euro 2016, Antonio Conte guided Italy to a memorable 2-0 win over Spain in the Round of 16, when Giorgio Chiellini and Graziano Pelle found the back of the net to take the Azzurri to the quarter-finals, where they lost to Germany on penalties.\n\nSpeaking to Gianluca Di Marzio, Eder first discussed Italy's upcoming Group B clash with Spain.\n\n\"Spain vs Italy is always a great challenge, nice to play. I watched Italy with Albania. In my opinion, after the initial fear, the guys played an excellent match.\n\n\"Spain's strength, however, lies in knowing how to always impress at any time. They stand very tall and press hard, Italy will have to be good at building up to get out of it.\"\n\nHe remembered Italy's win over la Roja back in Euro 2016.\n\n\"We had prepared for it very well. Conte had told us that the Spaniards played a lot of one-on-ones, coming at us high. He had asked me and Pell\u00e9 to play on their centre-backs, Piqu\u00e9 and Sergio Ramos, to bring them out and allow our midfielders to attack the spaces behind the defensive line.\n\n\"In my opinion this should be the tactical key for Spalletti's guys. If you can win duels, you can do damage and have free reign.\"\n\nEder spoke highly about Azzurri coach Luciano Spalletti.\n\n\"I had him at Inter and he brings his ideas back to the national team too, both in the way of preparing for matches and in talking about his group to unite them even more. In the end, this is the most important element.\"\n\nHe remembered the relationships formed in the Italy squad at Euro 2016.\n\n\"In 2016 with Conte we had an important collective, beyond the individuals and the qualities. That allowed us to get one step away from the semi-finals.\n\n\"On our days off after the matches we always went together to the restaurants near the sea. We were with the families, we talked about the match, they were beautiful moments that created even closer relationships.\"\n\nEder is confident that Italy can go far in this tournament.\n\n\"I think that if Italy gets through this group they can get to the end. They have players with functional characteristics.\"\n\nHe was asked about comparisons with the 2016 squad.\n\n\"If Scamacca represents Pell\u00e9 a bit, I see myself in Chiesa because I played freely on the pitch.\"\n\nFinally, Eder discussed who'd be decisive in this Italy squad.\n\n\"Jorginho and Barella in midfield can make the difference for Spalletti's way of playing. But up front the decisive player is Chiesa. He can create the play from nothing, he can win the match on his own by bringing out something different.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Conte", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antonio Conte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Chiellini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Giorgio Chiellini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "German Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_Piqu\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gerard Piqu\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Ramos", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Ramos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorginho_(footballer,_born_December_1991)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jorginho (footballer, born December 1991)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianluca_Scamacca", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gianluca Scamacca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol\u00f2_Barella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicol\u00f2 Barella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciano_Spalletti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luciano Spalletti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inter Milan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/football_italia_articles_132/c8227d0b01f8629fe45ec4875535bbc8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661646", "eventUri": "eng-9661646", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

The Italian also scored from outside the box when the ball landed to him so Rodri will be gearing up to not give Barella the space to do so.\n\nAlthough Rodri's role keeps him deep, his distribution play is essential for Spain and if Barella fails to close in the gaps and lets Rodri flow freely down the middle, Italy will face dangerous attacks from all around in the final third.\n\nCUCURELLA (SPAIN) vs CHIESA (ITALY) Italy's Federico Chiesa. | Photo Credit: AP\n\nItaly's Federico Chiesa. | Photo Credit: AP\n\nFederico Chiesa, Italy's man of the match from last game and arguably its best player will be the most dangerous thorn in Spain's side. His dribbling, build-up play and lethal finishing makes him Italy's main man in its attacking ranks as he is incredible if allowed to roam freely on his right flank.\n\nSpain's left back Marc Cucurella will have his work cut out for him reading Chiesa's movements and containing his play both on and off the ball. If Chiesa switches his wing and plays on the left instead, the same responsibility will fall to veteran Dani Carvajal. If Chiesa manages to beat Spain's full backs time and time again on the flanks, Italy will unlock a plethora of avenues to attack the goal.\n\nMORATA (SPAIN) VS BASTONI (ITALY) Spain's Alvaro Morata. | Photo Credit: AP\n\nSpain's Alvaro Morata. | Photo Credit: AP\n\nAlvaro Morata is a prolific goalscorer as the striker proved in Spain's opening clash by netting the first goal against Croatia.\n\nHe has scored 36 goals in 74 appearances for Spain and is leading his nation as the captain this time around. Spain loves to play threaded passes in the final third for Morata to chase, but it might be difficult to do that against the Azzurri with Bastoni leading the backline.\n\nBastoni is expected to charge on Morata and apply pressure hence Morata could struggle to find space and time to make attempts on goal. If Morata manages to shake Bastoni off of his heels, Spain will have a better chance of converting the chances it creates.\n\nLatest on SportstarHall of Famer Waisale Serevi named head coach of Indian men's, women's rugby 7s teamsTeam SportstarIND vs AFG Predicted Playing XI, T20 World Cup Super 8: Can Kuldeep Yadav, Yashasvi Jaiswal bolster India's lineup vs Afghanistan?Team SportstarISL: Chennaiyin FC secures services of Brazilian midfielder Lukas BrambillaTeam SportstarHow to watch Copa America 2024 live in India?

Thursday's clash with Spain, who dazzled on Matchday 1, will be a big test of their credentials.\n\nHere's how Italy could line up against Luis de la Fuente's Spain in Group B of Euro 2024.\n\nGK: Gianluigi Donnarumma - His tournament couldn't have got off to a worse start but Donnarumma made a big save to preserve Italy's victory on Saturday.\n\nRB: Giovanni Di Lorenzo - The steady right-back previously thrived under Spalletti at Napoli and Di Lorenzo will play a prominent role for Italy this summer.\n\nCB: Gianluca Mancini - The Italian media are reporting of the manager making a few changes to his team to combat Spain's threat on Thursday. Mancini, an aggressive defender who loves contact, could be brought in to man-mark Alvaro Morata.\n\nCB: Alessandro Bastoni - Inter's classy centre-back restored parity against Albania which set the tone for a typically assured performance. Bastoni's header was just his second goal for the Azzurri.\n\nLB: Federico Dimarco - Spain may well play for an early throw-in down Dimarco's side given his antics on Matchday 1 allowed Albania to score the fastest goal in Euros history.\n\nCM: Jorginho - The Arsenal midfielder produced a typically efficient midfield display against Albania, but his defensive mettle and astuteness will be put to the test in Gelsenkirchen given Spain's dynamism in the middle of the park.\n\nCM: Bryan Cristante - Davide Frattesi may be used as a super sub on this occasion, with reports suggesting Spalletti is going to favour the physicality of Cristante.\n\nCM: Nicolo Barella - The Italian superstar netted the early winner to ensure the Azzurri's title defence got off to a winning start. Given the profiles in Spalletti's attack, Barella's goals may be key for them this summer.\n\nRW: Federico Chiesa - Chiesa has struggled to find his most potent form for Juventus since returning from an anterior cruciate ligament tear, but the Italian seems to save his best work for the national team. His performance against Albania was bright down the right.\n\nST: Mateo Retegui - Italy certainly aren't blessed with an array of premier strikers and Spalletti could already make a change. The energetic Genoa forward only earned his first cap in 2023 and may be preferred to Gianluca Scamacca for Thursday's huge Group B clash.\n\nLW: Lorenzo Pellegrini - With Dimarco flying down the left, Pellegrini very much functions as an auxiliary wide man. The Roma playmaker will drift off his flank to overload the middle of the park in a bid to establish control.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianluigi_Donnarumma", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gianluigi Donnarumma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciano_Spalletti", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luciano Spalletti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianluca_Mancini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gianluca Mancini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Bastoni", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alessandro Bastoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Di_Lorenzo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Giovanni Di Lorenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Dimarco", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federico Dimarco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Cristante", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Cristante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lvaro_Morata", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lvaro Morata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S.C._Napoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.S.C.

La Furia Roja completely overwhelmed Croatia in the opening period, but not all because of their trademark technical mastery.\n\nItaly are the next to feel the brunt of this evolving Spanish team that looks set to enjoy a deep run in Germany this summer.\n\nA victory would allow De la Fuente to rest and rotate against Albania on Matchday 3, so here's the team he could pick for Thursday's game in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nGK: Unai Simon - Simon has endured a fairly up-and-down international career to date, but Saturday's win was a high point for the Athletic Club goalkeeper as he saved a penalty from Bruno Petkovic to preserve his clean sheet.\n\nRB: Dani Carvajal - Carvajal was used relentlessly by Carlo Ancelotti last season and likely won't earn much respite this summer. The right-back opened his account for the tournament in Berlin.\n\nCB: Nacho Fernandez - Having worked his way into De la Fuente's thinking following a fine season at Real Madrid, Nacho is now set to play a big role for his country in Germany.\n\nCB: Robin Le Normand - Aymeric Laporte is building up his fitness, but Le Normand got the nod on Matchday 1 and is expected to retain his place.\n\nLB: Marc Cucurella - The Chelsea man was preferred to Alejandro Grimaldo against Croatia, with De la Fuente opting against a gung-ho approach out wide by deploying the Bayer Leverkusen output machine.\n\nCM: Rodri - A booking in Berlin meant Rodri's campaign didn't get off to a completely perfect start and the Manchester City midfielder will have to be careful until the quarter-finals to avoid a suspension.\n\nCM: Pedri - Pedri's minutes will have to be carefully managed this summer, but a rest is more likely against Albania if Spain can get the job done on Thursday.\n\nCM: Fabian Ruiz - The Paris Saint-Germain midfielder snatched the final spot up for grabs in Spain's midfield by scoring a fine solo goal in Saturday's win.\n\nRW: Lamine Yamal - The 16-year-old enjoyed his first taste of major tournament football on Saturday and took to it like it was any other occasion. Yamal set up Carvajal in Spain's 3-0 win.\n\nST: Alvaro Morata - The skipper ensured his Euro 2024 campaign started on the right foot as he opened the scoring in Saturday's convincing win.

Whoever won this game, if there was a winner, would seal top spot with one match to spare.\n\nSpain had looked more convincing in their first game, a 3-0 win over Croatia, and against Italy La Roja showed that they should be considered serious favourites to win Euro 2024.\n\nAlthough they only won 1-0, Spain were very comfortable in their victory and on another night it could have been two, three or even four. La Roja had 20 shots in total with nine on target and an xG of 1.9. Italy, on the other hand, had four shots and hit the target once.\n\nAnd, at the heart of Spain's performance, were three young stars with a combined age of 58. Nico Williams is the grandad of the trio, turning 22 two days before the Euro 2024 final. Pedri turns 22 in November, while Lamine Yamal is 17 on the eve of the Euro 2024 final.\n\nGoing into the tournament, all of the focus was on Yamal and all the records he could break. He has already broken two, becoming the youngest person to play and assist in a European Championship, doing so in Spain's opener against Croatia.\n\nHe shone outside of the assist, and although there were no direct involvements against Italy, it was another performance well beyond Yamal's years.\n\nIn his 71 minutes on the pitch, Yamal created one chance, made 18 passes in the final third, had one shot sail narrowly wide, completed four take-ons and had two touches in the opposition box. Yamal was very much the man in the build up for Spain, happy to share the ball around when some youngsters might look to make a name for themselves.\n\nYamal is the current Golden Boy of Spanish football, but not too long ago that was Pedri's title. And perhaps it should still be. Pedri is still only 21 despite feeling like he's been around for years, though he did make his Spain debut in 2021. That came as part of a packed season that did hurt Pedri quite a lot, ruining his fitness and bringing injury issues that still plague the Spaniard today.\n\nPedri entered the summer having not played for Spain since the 2022 World Cup, missing the previous six international breaks through injury. He was thrown in from the start in friendlies against Andorra and Northern Ireland, playing an hour in each match and scoring twice against the latter.\n\nThere was another hour for Pedri, and an assist, against Croatia. He had 10 more minutes against Italy and, although he didn't score or assist, this was Pedri closer to his best. He had three shots in total with two on target, and really should have scored at least one, posting a match-high xG of 0.65. Pedri also created three chances, made 16 passes in the final third and six touches in the opposition box.\n\nBut perhaps the young star of the night was Williams.\n\nThe Athletic Bilbao man had eight touches in the opposition box, more than any player on either team. He also created a match-high four chances, made 23 passes in the final third, put in five crosses and completed four take-ons.\n\nIt was Williams who brought the first goal too. Although he won't get an assist for it, Williams was causing problems down the flank and put a dangerous cross into the box. It was nodded slightly on by Alvaro Morata and then touched by Gianluigi Donnarumma before being bundled into his own net by Riccardo Calafiori.\n\nA moment to forget for the Italian defender, but a night that Williams stamped his name as one of the current and future stars of Spanish football, alongside Pedri and Yamal.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedri", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pedri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamine_Yamal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lamine Yamal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Boy_(award)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden Boy (award)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccardo_Calafiori", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riccardo Calafiori"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianluigi_Donnarumma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gianluigi Donnarumma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lvaro_Morata", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lvaro Morata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football in Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbao", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bilbao"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bilbao"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andorra", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andorra"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Andorra"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Promotions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Promotions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661646", "eventUri": "eng-9661646", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

He's not lazy. He runs a lot. In terms of metres traveled and speed, his numbers are incredible, also in maintaining speed over long distances, and that allows him to be more direct.\n\n\"The same as (Lamine) Yamal.

Maybe against Spain there are more vertical passes because they don't wait on the edge of the area. Against Spain we will have to go beyond the defensive line because they are more aggressive and also put pressure on the goalkeeper.\n\n\"Morata presses back passes 20 out of 20 times.

Italy is the defending European champion; Spain currently holds the UEFA Nations League, while Croatia finished third at the most recent World Cup finals. Albania is undoubtedly the underdog and will hope not to be the whipping boys. Italy has turned a corner since recent struggles and will fancy itself to progress even if that means finishing runners-up. Spain will be a slight favourite, and Croatia can go deep into the championship. Group B will be required viewing. Will Italy make it out, or will it be a tournament of disappointment for the Azzurri?\n\nThis will be the fifth encounter since Albania gained their independence. Not only has the Azzurri been perfect to date, they've conceded one goal, which came in the last showdown, a 3-1 success which saw Ardian Ismajli put the hosts in front before Roberto Mancini's men emphatically responded.\n\nMeetings between these Mediterranean rivals have, more often than not, been historic ones. Three of their previous meetings took place under the FIFA World Cup banner, including a notorious 1994 showdown that saw a clash between Mauro Tassotti and Luis Enrique that left the latter bloodied. Spain broke their penalty shootout hoodoo against the Italians at Euro 2008 before Vicente del Bosque's side ruthlessly defended their European crown, running out 4-0 winners four years later in Kyiv. Italy gained a semblance of revenge at Euro 2016 and 2020, the most recent outing en route to winning it all.\n\nThere are very few nations against which the Italians have struggled; Croatia is one of them. The first meeting in April 1942 saw Italy run out 4-0 winners. Since then, it's been a combination of losses (three, notably at the World Cup 2002) and stalemates (five).

With plenty of Euro 2024 groups now approaching their final games, it's becoming - slightly - clearer who's going through and who needs what in the remaining games to join them.\n\nHere, then, is the latest state of play in the three groups where matchday two is either completed or under way. We'll obviously be updating this and adding the remaining groups as we go, so look forward to that.\n\nA reminder that we know you don't need by this point: the top two in each group go through, along with the four best runners-up. The full details on all the tournament admin and paperwork can be found here.\n\nGermany - P2 W2 D0 L0 GD+6 Pts 6\n\nCan finish no lower than second after their victory over Hungary and Switzerland's draw with Scotland.\n\nWill top the group if they avoid defeat against Switzerland in their final game.\n\nWill win the group if they beat Germany. Will be sure of second if they draw, or if Scotland don't beat Hungary. If they lose to Germany and Scotland beat Hungary, it also requires a six-goal swing to drop Switzerland to third in the group. And even then, their four points would leave them strong favourites for one of the best third-place spots. Like we said, they're almost certainly there.\n\nScotland - P2 W0 D1 L1 GD-4 Pts 1\n\nMust surely beat Hungary in their final game. If they do that and Switzerland lose to Germany, then a six-goal swing could yet see them pinch second place.\n\nThat's unlikely, but any win over Hungary would leave them on four points and well placed for one of the third-place qualification spots. No third-place team with four points has missed out in the two previous Euros played under the current format.\n\nA draw with Hungary also secures third place, but two points and a heavily negative goal difference would leave them highly unlikely to be one of the best four.\n\nDefeat to Hungary and Scotland would finish bottom of the group.\n\nHungary - P2 W0 D0 L2 GD-4 Pts 0\n\nAutomatic qualification hopes are now gone after two defeats. Must beat Scotland to finish third. But to be one of the third-place qualifiers they may well also need to beat them well to repair some of that goal-difference damage from the first two games.\n\nAs an aside, the fact a draw is of no use to either side means we could be in for an absolute treat if that one is level heading into the closing stages.\n\nSpain - P1 W1 D0 L0 GD+3 Pts 3\n\nWill guarantee top spot in the group if they beat Italy on Thursday night; while Italy could still catch them on six points in that scenario, Spain would prevail on head-to-head.\n\nA draw against Italy and win over Albania will see Spain top the group unless Italy beat Croatia and effect a three-goal net swing in goal difference or a two-goal swing and beat Spain on goals scored. Will also top the group if they draw both their remaining games and Italy fail to beat Croatia, and could even possibly finish top if they draw with Italy, lose to Albania and Croatia beat Italy.\n\nTwo draws guarantee Spain finish second at worst, while a single point from their two remaining games would almost certainly guarantee third place at worst. There is in this group one set of results that leaves everyone on four points: if Spain and Italy draw, Croatia beat Italy and Albania beat Spain. Probably best not to think about that one too hard.\n\nItaly - P1 W1 D0 L0 GD+1 Pts 3\n\nWill win the group if they beat Spain. A draw against Spain and a win over Croatia will also see Italy top if Spain fail to beat Albania.\n\nCan also still win the group with two draws, if Spain lose to Albania. Two draws do guarantee second place at worst.\n\nDefeat to Spain and a draw with Croatia would also guarantee second place for Italy; even if Albania beat Spain to move level on four points with Italy they would be behind on head-to-head.\n\nA draw against Spain and defeat to Croatia would leave Italy in third place, unless Albania beat Spain in which case we've got our dreaded 'everyone on four points' scenario again.\n\nAlbania - P2 W0 D1 L1 GD-1 Pts 1\n\nCan still finish second if they beat Spain in their final game and Italy have already done the same. Albania would also finish second if they beat Spain and Italy draw both their games.\n\nLet's not look any closer at that 'four points all round' scenario again. Would finish third in the group if they draw with Spain and Croatia don't beat Italy, but would be unlikely to progress with just two points.\n\nCroatia - P2 W0 D1 L1 GD-3 Pts 1\n\nWould be the likeliest team to come out worst in the four-points-all-round scenario given their goal difference.\n\nLike Albania, they can finish third with a draw in their final game but realistically will need to win it if they want to finish among the top four third-place teams.\n\nIt could be better than that, though. If Italy don't beat Spain tonight, then any victory over Italy on matchday three would guarantee Croatia second place.\n\nIf Italy do beat Spain, then victory over Italy would still guarantee Croatia third place, and almost certainly one of the qualifying spots.\n\nEngland - P1 W1 D0 L0 GD+1 Pts 3\n\nSerbia's last-gasp draw with Slovenia means England will win Group C if they win either of their remaining games.\n\nTwo draws will get England top spot unless Denmark beat Serbia, but would still take England through in second place.\n\nThe only way England don't finish third at least in the group is now if they lose both their remaining games and Serbia beat Denmark.\n\nSlovenia - P2 W0 D2 L0 GD+0 Pts 2\n\nCan still finish top or bottom of Group C after a pair of contrasting 1-1 draws against Denmark and Serbia.\n\nVictory over England in their final game could get Slovenia top spot if England fail to beat Denmark this afternoon.\n\nBut they could also finish bottom of Group C even with a draw against England if Denmark beat England and Serbia beat Denmark.\n\nThis group currently retains the possibility of England winning all three games and Slovenia, Denmark and Serbia all finishing on two points each after drawing all three games against each other. In that case it comes down to goal difference, goals scored and so on to separate them, with one enormously fortunate team taking second place and with it direct qualification for the next round. The team that finishes third in this scenario could also qualify, but it would be unlikely with just two points.\n\nDenmark - P1 W0 D1 L0 GD+0 Pts 1\n\nWill win Group C if they beat both England and Serbia. Victory over England and a draw or defeat against Serbia will also secure top spot if England fail to beat Slovenia. A draw against England and a two-goal win over Serbia would also get top spot for Denmark if England draw against Slovenia.\n\nIf Denmark draw their two remaining games they could also still finish second if England-Slovenia is also a draw. In this scenario, England will win the group and second place between Denmark and Slovenia comes down to goals scored.\n\nWin either of their remaining games, and Denmark can finish no lower than third.\n\nSerbia - P2 W0 D1 L1 GD-1 Pts 1\n\nKept their automatic qualification hopes alive with that late, late equaliser against Slovenia. Can still even top the group, if Denmark beat England, England and Slovenia draw and Serbia beat Denmark.\n\nVictory over Denmark secures second spot for Serbia if England avoid defeat against both Denmark and Slovenia and also, counter-intuitively, if England lose both those games.\n\nVictory over Denmark guarantees third place at worst - there is no four points for everyone scenario here.

The two nations have a rich history and will incredibly meet for the fifth straight European Championship, after a semi-final showdown last time out.\n\nAhead of their contest in Gelsenkirchen, we've selected our Spain vs Italy Combined XI.\n\nA crucial part of Italy's success at the 2020 European Championship, where he was named Player of the Tournament to become the first goalkeeper to win the award. His club form has not always coincided with what was once viewed as an unstoppable ascent to becoming the world's best goalkeeper but Donnarumma remains an elite shot-stopper.\n\nStill just 25, he has already won 63 caps and now captains the Azzurri.\n\nSpain's opening fixture with Croatia was Dani Carvajal's first game at a European Championship. The decorated defender had missed the last two tournaments through injury and a decade on from his debut for Spain, played and scored at a Euros. Carvajal has been an unsung hero of six Champions League-winning teams, a joint record for an individual player, and has had his share of the limelight of late.\n\nHe's scored seven goals for club and country in 2023-24 to date, as many as he managed in the past 10 seasons combined, including one in the Champions League final and in the opening fixture of this tournament.\n\nAlessandro Bastoni was a squad member of Italy's success three years ago but the Inter Milan centre-back arrives at Euro 2024 as the new leader of the Azzurri backline.\n\nBastoni's ball-carrying and penetrative passes through lines were a feature of Inter's Scudetto success in 2023-24 and earned him the Serie A Best Defender award. The 25-year-old - who scored in Italy's opening win over Albania - is pushing towards the elite bracket of centre-backs in world football right now.\n\nRiccardo Calafiori's impression on Italian football this season has earned him an Azzurri place. The 22-year-old defender's unorthodox route to Euro 2024 has included a devastating knee injury that halted his progress as a teenager at Roma, a short stint in Switzerland at Basel, and a change of position from full-back to central defence.\n\nAfter signing for Bologna last summer, Calafiori excelled as a centre-back as Thiago Motta's men secured a fifth-placed finish in Serie A and Champions League qualification. His elegance and anticipation have sparked a scramble for his services this summer with Juventus pushing hardest to sign the defender.\n\nDimarco, like Calafiori, is a player who has taken an unusual path to the top. Developed and discarded at Inter Milan, the Nerazzurri quickly noticed the error of their ways and re-signed Dimarco from Swiss side Sion in 2019.\n\nAfter loan spells at Parma and Hellas Verona, he has broken into the Inter team to become one of the most effective wing-backs in Italian football. Across the last two seasons, Dimarco has recorded 18 goals and assists in Serie A.\n\nSpain's metronome might be the most influential midfielder in the game right now. Rodri reached 50 league games unbeaten in a Manchester City shirt during the club's title-clinching win over West Ham last month and has been equally important for La Roja.\n\nHis calm, control and combative edge will be fundamental to Luis de la Fuente's side in their bid to win Euro 2024.\n\nThe Azzurri's all-action midfielder turned their opening game around against Albania, with Barella's stunning strike underlining his importance to the side. The 27-year-old is one of Serie A's top talents and has won eight trophies in the last three years, including two league titles with Inter Milan and Euro 2020 with the national team.\n\nBarella's box-to-box industry will be key in attempts to take on a stylish Spanish midfield, with late ventures forward and relenting work-rate the hallmarks of his game.\n\nPedri was named as the Young Player of the Tournament at Euro 2020 and returns to the biggest stage with Spain again this summer. Despite an injury-hit season with Barcelona, the 21-year-old ended the campaign well with a brace against Rayo Vallecano and recorded an assist during Spain's opening win over Croatia.\n\nA fabulous footballer to watch with his intricacy in tight areas and flawless control, Pedri could shine in the Spanish side for the next decade.\n\nFew footballers have entered Euro 2024 with as much hype as Lamine Yamal, the Spanish starlet who has already broken records. At 16, he has become the youngest-ever player at a European Championship and registered an assist with an inch-perfect cross for Dani Carvajal on debut.\n\nYamal, who is incredibly combining performing at Euro 2024 with school studies, has seven goals and assists from eight caps for La Roja since his record-breaking senior debut in September. He is a special, special talent.\n\nNico Williams is another of Spain's emerging generation and the Athletic Bilbao winger is an excitement machine. The 21-year-old scored eight goals and provided 17 assists in all competitions last season, and ranked among La Liga's leading players last season for assists (2nd), successful take-ons (2nd), crosses (7th) and progressive carries (4th).\n\nA \u00a343m release clause will look even more appealing with a strong summer.\n\nSpain winger wants Barcelona move despite Premier League talks\n\nAlvaro Morata has had his fair share of critics but the Spain captain has grown into his role as La Roja's leading man. The 31-year-old has 13 goals in his last 23 caps, including their first of Euro 2024 with the opener against Croatia.\n\nThat goal took him fourth overall in Spain's list of leading scorers, while his goal-per-game ratio is significantly better than either Fernando Torres or Raul, the two players immediately above him. It was also his seventh in the European Championship, only Michel Platini (9) and Cristiano Ronaldo (14) have ever scored more.\n\nRead - Euro 2008 - Xavi and Spain's pass masters finally end decades of underachievement", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter Milan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Bastoni", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alessandro Bastoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Dimarco", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federico Dimarco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Carvajal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dani Carvajal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_Italy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football in Italy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelsenkirchen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serie A Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedri", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodri_(footballer,_born_1996)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rodri (footballer, born 1996)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scudetto", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scudetto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parma_Calcio_1913", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parma Calcio 1913"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Sion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Sion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Motta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Motta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol\u00f2_Barella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicol\u00f2 Barella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellas_Verona_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hellas Verona F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

Spain into last 16 at Euro 2024", "body": "Riccardo Calafiori's own goal handed Spain a 1-0 victory over defending champions Italy as they booked their place in the last 16 at Euro 2024.\n\nThe defender's misfortune 10 minutes after the break ultimately settled the Group B contest in Gelsenkirchen, although had it not been for the heroics of keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who made a string of fine saves, and the crossbar, which denied the impressive Nico Williams a deserved goal, the Spaniards would have prevailed in some comfort.\n\nSpain would have been ahead within two minutes had Donnarumma not managed to tip Pedri's header from Williams' pinpoint cross over his bar, and the traffic was very much one-way in the early stages.\n\nDonnarumma was called upon again twice within seconds, first blocking Morata's shot from a tight angle after good work by 16-year-old Lamine Yamal before turning Fabian Ruiz's searing drive over.\n\nWilliams was causing all kinds of problems for Giovanni Di Lorenzo down the Italian right, while Yamal was equally prominent on the other flank, but it was Ruiz who tested Donnarumma four minutes before the break with another sweetly-struck attempt from distance.\n\nItaly boss Luciano Spalletti opted for change at the break, sending on Bryan Cristante and Andrea Cambiaso for Jorginho and Davide Frattesi in a bid to gain a foothold, but Cristante was left walking a tightrope within seconds when he was booked for an ugly challenge on Rodri.\n\nPedri should have put the 2008 and 2012 winners ahead within seven minutes of the restart when he ran on to Marc Cucurella's pull-back, but stabbed wastefully wide, and although he did hit the target from 20 yards seconds later, Donnarumma was equal to the task.\n\nThe Italy keeper was finally beaten with 55 minutes gone when Morata flicked on Williams' cross and Donnarumma palmed it on to the helpless Calafiori, who could only bundle it into his own net.\n\nMorata saw a long-range attempt palmed over and Yamal curled another just wide as Spain went for the kill, prompting a response from the Italians which saw Cambiaso fire a dangerous ball across Unai Simon's six-yard box with substitute Mateo Retegui lurking.\n\nHowever, Williams rattled the crossbar with a swerving attempt which left Donnarumma helpless, although he had to be at his best to save from substitute Ayoze Perez twice at the death.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Retegui lurking.\n\nHowever, Williams rattled the crossbar with a swerving attempt which left Donnarumma helpless, although he had to be at his best to save from substitute Ayoze Perez twice at the death.\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Thu 20 Jun 2024, 10:17 PM Last updated: Thu 20 Jun 2024, 10:39 PM", "source": {"uri": "con-telegraph.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Connaught

outclassed Italy", "body": "Riccardo Calafiori's own goal handed Spain a 1-0 victory over defending champions Italy as they booked their place in the last 16 at Euro 2024.\n\nThe defender's misfortune 10 minutes after the break ultimately settled the Group B contest in Gelsenkirchen, although had it not been for the heroics of keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who made a string of fine saves, and the crossbar, which denied the impressive Nico Williams a deserved goal, the Spaniards would have prevailed in some comfort.\n\nSpain would have been ahead within two minutes had Donnarumma not managed to tip Pedri's header from Williams' pinpoint cross over his bar, and the traffic was very much one-way in the early stages.\n\nWilliams himself passed up a glorious 10th-minute opportunity to open the scoring when he contrived to head wide from Alvaro Morata's equally inviting cross with the goal at his mercy.\n\nDonnarumma was called upon again twice within seconds, first blocking Morata's shot from a tight angle after good work by 16-year-old Lamine Yamal before turning Fabian Ruiz's searing drive over.\n\nWilliams was causing all kinds of problems for Giovanni Di Lorenzo down the Italian right, while Yamal was equally prominent on the other flank, but it was Ruiz who tested Donnarumma four minutes before the break with another sweetly-struck attempt from distance.\n\nItaly boss Luciano Spalletti opted for change at the break, sending on Bryan Cristante and Andrea Cambiaso for Jorginho and Davide Frattesi in a bid to gain a foothold, but Cristante was left walking a tightrope within seconds when he was booked for an ugly challenge on Rodri.\n\nPedri should have put the 2008 and 2012 winners ahead within seven minutes of the restart when he ran on to Marc Cucurella's pull-back, but stabbed wastefully wide, and although he did hit the target from 20 yards seconds later, Donnarumma was equal to the task.\n\nThe Italy keeper was finally beaten with 55 minutes gone when Morata flicked on Williams' cross and Donnarumma palmed it on to the helpless Calafiori, who could only bundle it into his own net.\n\nMorata saw a long-range attempt palmed over and Yamal curled another just wide as Spain went for the kill, prompting a response from the Italians which saw Cambiaso fire a dangerous ball across Unai Simon's six-yard box with substitute Mateo Retegui lurking.\n\nHowever, Williams rattled the crossbar with a swerving attempt which left Donnarumma helpless, although he had to be at his best to save from substitute Ayoze Perez twice at the death.\n\nListen to the RT\u00c9 Soccer podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nWatch every game from Euro 2024 on RT\u00c92 and RT\u00c9 Player as well as highlights

I didn't need to give too much advice about Spalletti, our staff already studied him carefully. We know he likes to press high and steal back the ball, so I expect Italy to be strong, aggressive and work the ball well.\n\n\"I was very happy that Napoli won the Scudetto, as I have many friends there and have such affection for the city. I'm happy for all the players who won the title.\"\n\nSpain were not considered among the favourites before going into EURO 2024, but their thumping 3-0 win over Croatia perhaps changed that perception.\n\n\"We don't see ourselves as favourites, but we do have a lot of confidence in our potential to go all the way. It won't be easy, there are many strong teams, but we'll give our all,\" continued Fabian Ruiz.\n\nMuch has been said about the fact Spain have changed under Luis de la Fuente and are now more vertical in their approach play rather than slow and steady possession.\n\n\"We still like to have the ball, Spain has players who want to keep the ball, but our coach wants us to get to the opposition penalty area more rapidly.

It leaves Italy second, with Croatia and Albania both on a point apiece ahead of the final round of games.\n\nHere are the player ratings for both teams from the match:\n\nUnai Simon, 7. Didn't have a single save to make all game. A very quiet night.\n\nDani Carvajal, 7. Won his challenges, kept play simple. Simply did what he needed to with his more attacking teammates in charge.\n\nRobin Le Normand, 7. Did well in his one-v-ones and took a few late hits from frustrated Italian forwards. Had a header cleared off the line.\n\nAymeric Laporte, 6. A quieter night than his centre-back partner after replacing Nacho in the lineup. Caught out by runs behind once or twice, maybe a sign he's still working back to fitness.\n\nMarc Cucurella, 8. Stuck well to his task of halting Frattesi and Chiesa. Didn't get forward too much but that was a good thing, as it left Williams space to keep raiding the flank. Another decent showing.\n\nRodri, 7. Not his most magnificent game ever in terms of progression and protection but the fact Spain were so dominant meant it was at times a stroll for him. Took a heavy challenge to the foot. Barely misplaced a pass.\n\nPedri, 8. Unstoppable with his clever movement and ability to nip past tackles. Best player on the park even if not the most spectacular one. Another who wasted chances in front of goal though.\n\nFabian Ruiz, 7. Almost scored a thunderous long-range effort, then tried his luck too often with half-chances. Kept Spain dominant with good on-the-ball work all night.\n\nLamine Yamal, 7. Great skill and pace from the right once more but should have scored within a few minutes. Bent a brilliant shot just past the post on the hour. Non-stop running and creativity.\n\nAlvaro Morata, 8. Some brilliant link-up play and working in the channels. Denied at the near post after some sharp movement in the box.\n\nNico Williams, 8. Very lively start but missed a sitter with a close-range header. Had Di Lorenzo on toast with his dribbles down the left flank and delivered the cross for the opener. Smashed the upright with a shot of his own.\n\nSubs: F. Torres 6, A. Baena 7, M. Oyarzabal n/a, A. Perez n/a, M. Merino n/a.\n\nGianluigi Donnnarumma, 7. Booked early on for complaining. Great tip-over from Ruiz's shot, but knocked a low cross into his own defender for an own goal. Made another two late saves to keep his team in it.\n\nGiovanni Di Lorenzo, 6. Williams bypassed him in the first couple of minutes and didn't stop the torment all night, though the right-back improved in those duels as time went on.\n\nAlessandro Bastoni, 5. Not one of his finest nights, mostly due to the fact he was afforded no protection to stop the crosses and through balls.\n\nRiccardo Calafiore, 5. Defended fairly well but the runners kept coming and he couldn't track them all alone. Lucky to escape a first-half booking and then turned into his own net after the restart.\n\nFederico Dimarco, 5. Didn't really get the chance to get forward in his usual manner.\n\nJorginho, 4. Totally overrun in midfield. Didn't have the agility to keep up with Spain's play and subbed at half time.\n\nNicolo Barella, 5. Foreceful at times to try and stop Spain scything through but couldn't really impact in an offensive sense.\n\nFederico Chiesa, 4. Got no change out of Cucurella in the first half and went left wing for the second, where his fortunes didn't improve and he was hooked soon after.\n\nDavide Frattesi, 5. Couldn't impact at all in the first half beyond a few fouls and attempted runs forward. Subbed at the break.\n\nLorenzo Pellegrini, 4. Anonymous from the left, went central after the double half-time sub to much the same effect. Just 33 touches as the team's primary playmaker says it all.\n\nGianluca Scamacca, 5. Tried his best to hold play up and bring others into the game from deep but with very little success. Subbed past the hour mark with Chiesa.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Le_Normand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robin Le Normand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unai_Sim\u00f3n", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unai Sim\u00f3n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacho_(footballer,_born_1990)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nacho (footballer, born 1990)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aymeric_Laporte", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aymeric Laporte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Carvajal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dani Carvajal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Ruiz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Ruiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedri", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davide_Frattesi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Davide Frattesi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodri_(footballer,_born_1996)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rodri (footballer, born 1996)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Cucurella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marc Cucurella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Di_Lorenzo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Giovanni Di Lorenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Chiesa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federico Chiesa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lvaro_Morata", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lvaro Morata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lex_Baena", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lex Baena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorginho_(footballer,_born_December_1991)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jorginho (footballer, born December 1991)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianluca_Scamacca", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gianluca Scamacca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Bastoni", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alessandro Bastoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Dimarco", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federico Dimarco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferran_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ferran Torres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Merino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Merino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/20/21/SEI209665251.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661646", "eventUri": "eng-9661646", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1}

A couple more in the second half. Let us ask again: where are the haters?\n\nDi Lorenzo 4 - The Napoli captain will see Nico Williams in his nightmares.\n\nBastoni 6.5 - Best defender in the country for a reason. It wasn't an easy night, but he won almost every duel. Five from six on the ground, plus 91% passing accuracy. Italy's defensive leader for the next decade.\n\nCalafiori 5.5 - The build-up could not be as fluent as against Albania and Spain's defenders attracted him outside the defensive line quite often. Unlucky with the own goal.\n\nDimarco 4.5 - Struggled against Yamal just as much as Di Lorenzo vs. Williams and never had a chance to run forward. A tough night.\n\nJorginho 5 - Couldn't play tidily due to Spain's ferocious pressing and was often forced inside the box, so Cristante came in during the break. (46' Cristante 5.5)\n\nBarella 5 - Frustrated by Spain's pressing. He did find space in the middle of the park a couple of times in the first half, but movements from the rest of the team were not quick enough. He looked discouraged in the second half.\n\nChiesa 5 - Nullified by Cuccurella, it was not surprising to see him subbed off. (64' Zaccagni 5)\n\nFrattesi 4.5 - Same as Jorginho. Spain's pressing prevented him from playing the ball as he wanted. Like Jorginho, he was subbed off at the break. (46' Cambiaso 5.5)\n\nPellegrini 5 - Tried to link up attack and midfield but he was also ground by the Spanish blender. (82' Raspadori N/A)\n\nScamacca 5.5 - It's not easy to win one-v-one duels, imagine dealing with two defenders simultaneously at all times. The Atalanta star squeezed past the Spanish centre-backs only once, but the following pass for Barella was quite poor. (64' Retegui 5.5)\n\nCoach: Spalletti 5 - He wanted to prove Italy were an 'important school of football', but the Azzurri finished with no big chances, just three shots and 0.16 xG against Spain's 1.68. Not enough intensity and technical quality to hope for a better outcome. The plan was ambitious, but it didn't work out.\n\nSpain: Unai Simon 6; Carvajal 7, Le Normand 6.5, Laporte 6.5, Cucurella 7; Pedri 7 (71' Baena 6.5), Rodri 7.5, Fabian Ruiz 7.5 (93' Merino N/A); Yamal 7.5 (71' Torres 6), Morata 6.5 (78' Oyarzabal 6), Nico Williams 8 (78' Perez 7)", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Di_Lorenzo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Giovanni Di Lorenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorginho_(footballer,_born_December_1991)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jorginho (footballer, born December 1991)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Bastoni", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alessandro Bastoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianluigi_Donnarumma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gianluigi Donnarumma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Cristante", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Cristante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S.C._Napoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.S.C.

'Marcha Real' is one of four European anthems that doesn't contain any lyrics. Luis De La Fuente's side are set to face Italy in a crucial Euro 2024 clash on Thursday night.\n\nLuis De La Fuente's Spain side have left fans puzzled ahead of their crucial tie against Italy, with many spotting that none of the Spanish players sing during their national anthem.\n\nLa Roja are one of the strongest teams in this summer's competition, with many predicting that they will make it to the latter stages of the tournament. Blessed with stars such as Rodri and history-maker Lamine Yamal, the Spaniards have already made a strong start thanks to a 3-0 win over Croatia.\n\nThe further they progress over the course of the next month, the more fans will get to see the stoic national anthem. However, despite the fact that summer fans chant during the song, there is a good reason why the players refrain from doing so.\n\nRelated\n\nSpain 3-0 Croatia: Player Ratings and Match Highlights\n\nSpain put down a marker as they opened their Euro 2024 campaign with a convincing victory.\n\nWhy Spanish Players Don't Sing During National Anthem\n\nThe current version of the song was composed without any lyrics\n\nSpanish teams in the past have often been at the end of criticism for the fact that none of the players were seen singing during the pre-game anthem, with some going as far as to call the former world champions a 'disgrace.'\n\nHowever, those levying those complaints may be unaware that the reason why the squad don't sing, is because the Spanish national anthem doesn't have any lyrics. The origin of 'Marcha Real' links back to the 18th century, where the tune was used as a military march, as per Classic FM.\n\nThere have been several suggestions over possible lyrics in the past, with the Spanish Olympic committee attempting to have the phrase 'Viva Espana' open the national chant ahead of the 2008 Olympic Games. However, this was turned down due to the fact that the words were commonly used during General Francisco Franco's dictatorship.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Spain are one of four European countries to have no lyrics in their national anthem. The others include Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and San Marino.\n\nAnother reason why certain Spanish players may choose not to engage with the Spanish national anthem is because of their place of birth. Gerard Pique and Jordi Alba are two of the biggest stars from Spain's past whom received calls to be axed from the national set up due to the fact that they were both from Catalonia.\n\nThe region, located in the north-east of Spain, is home to Barcelona and has recently found itself fighting for its independence. Calls for this reached its peak in 2017, with an illegal referendum and mass protests taking place. The situation was so tense that Pique even stated that he would be willing to retire from international football if his inclusion was going to upset natives.\n\nRelated\n\nSpain at Euro 2024: Group, Fixtures, Players to Watch and More\n\nEverything you need to know about three-time European champions Spain ahead of Euro 2024.\n\nThe Spanish National Anthem's Old Lyrics\n\nThe song contained lyrics for just 35 years\n\nBetween 1938 and 1975, the Spanish national anthem did contain lyrics after the aforementioned General Francisco Franco came to power. Franco led the Nationalist party during a period of civil war, eventually overthrowing the Second Spanish Republic. The dictator ruled the country unopposed for over three decades, during which he instructed famed poet Jose Maria Peman to create a new anthem which included lyrics designed to promote 'the rebirth' of Spain.\n\nUpon Franco's passing in 1975 after battles with Parkinson's disease, the anthem was abolished, and a lyric-less anthem made its return. To this day, some fans can be seen singing the old lyrics as they get fired up before their team's games. However, the links to what is considered to be some of the darker days in modern day Spain mean that we are unlikely to see any of De La Fuente's men join in with the serenading.\n\nSpain's Euro 2024 So Far\n\nLa Roja will be looking to qualify for the next round against Italy\n\nThe two-time European champions put down a marker in their opening game against former World Cup finalists Croatia. Three first-half goals from Alvaro Morata, Fabian Ruiz and Dani Carvajal were enough to secure the three points.\n\nThe Spaniards, who have the eleventh youngest squad at Euro 2024, will now turn their attention to Italy on Thursday night, with a win over Luciano Spalletti men enough to see La Roja qualify for the knock-out stages.\n\nShould victory not be achieved, captain Morata will lead his side into a vital game against Albania on Monday. Should the Spaniards manage to top the group, a round of 16 tie against one of the sides who progress as one of the third-place qualifiers awaits.\n\nRelated\n\nWhy Rodri Wasn't Given Red Card in

last 16 at Euro 2024", "body": "The defender's misfortune 10 minutes after the break ultimately settled the Group B contest in Gelsenkirchen, although had it not been for the heroics of keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who made a string of fine saves, and the crossbar, which denied the impressive Nico Williams a deserved goal, the Spaniards would have prevailed in some comfort.\n\nSpain would have been ahead within two minutes had Donnarumma not managed to tip Pedri's header from Williams' pinpoint cross over his bar, and the traffic was very much one-way in the early stages.\n\nWilliams himself passed up a glorious 10th-minute opportunity to open the scoring when he contrived to head wide from Alvaro Morata's equally inviting cross with the goal at his mercy.\n\nDonnarumma was called upon again twice within seconds, first blocking Morata's shot from a tight angle after good work by 16-year-old Lamine Yamal before turning Fabian Ruiz's searing drive over.\n\nWilliams was causing all kinds of problems for Giovanni Di Lorenzo down the Italian right, while Yamal was equally prominent on the other flank, but it was Ruiz who tested Donnarumma four minutes before the break with another sweetly-struck attempt from distance.\n\nItaly boss Luciano Spalletti opted for change at the break, sending on Bryan Cristante and Andrea Cambiaso for Jorginho and Davide Frattesi in a bid to gain a foothold, but Cristante was left walking a tightrope within seconds when he was booked for an ugly challenge on Rodri.\n\nPedri should have put the 2008 and 2012 winners ahead within seven minutes of the restart when he ran on to Marc Cucurella's pull-back, but stabbed wastefully wide, and although he did hit the target from 20 yards seconds later, Donnarumma was equal to the task.\n\nThe Italy keeper was finally beaten with 55 minutes gone when Morata flicked on Williams' cross and Donnarumma palmed it on to the helpless Calafiori, who could only bundle it into his own net.\n\nMorata saw a long-range attempt palmed over and Yamal curled another just wide as Spain went for the kill, prompting a response from the Italians which saw Cambiaso fire a dangerous ball across Unai Simon's six-yard box with substitute Mateo Retegui lurking.\n\nHowever, Williams rattled the crossbar with a swerving attempt which left Donnarumma helpless, although he had to be at his best to save from substitute Ayoze Perez twice at the death.", "source": {"uri": "rhyljournal.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rhyl, Prestatyn and Abergele Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Ponytail: Italy v Spain as a modern classic", "body": "Donaueschingen (Germany) (AFP) - Italy and Spain face off on Thursday in the biggest match so far of Euro 2024, Luciano Spalletti's title holders and three-time champions La Roja going head-to-head in what has become a modern classic of international football.\n\nHere AFP Sport looks at their most memorable clashes as the two sides prepare to do battle for the fifth time in as many Euros, with top spot in Group B up for grabs:\n\nDivine Baggio sinks Spain at USA '94\n\nFew Italian players have captured the imagination of the football public quite like the \"Divine Ponytail\" Roberto Baggio, who lit up the 1994 World Cup and scored the decisive goal in a quarter-final battle with Spain.\n\nAfter Dino Baggio put Italy ahead with a rocket of a shot in the 25th minute in Foxborough, Jose Luis Caminero's deflected strike levelled the scores just before the hour.\n\nWith the match looking destined for extra time Roberto Baggio fired Italy into the last four by collecting Giuseppe Signori's lofted pass, skipping around Andoni Zubizarreta and drilling home a perfect finish.\n\nBaggio suffered a tragic end to his remarkable tournament as his missed penalty in the final with Brazil cost the Azzurri the World Cup.\n\nCasillas wins clash of titans with Buffon\n\nTwo years after winning the World Cup in a penalty shoot-out victory against France, it was Italy's turn for heartbreak as they fell to Spain in the quarter-finals of Euro 2008.\n\nIker Casillas earned eventual tournament winners Spain a spot-kick victory at the Ernst Happel Stadion in Vienna against Gianluigi Buffon's Italy after a gruelling match which finished goalless.\n\nCasillas and Buffon were considered the two best goalkeepers in the world at the time, with both captaining their respective national teams.\n\nReal Madrid icon Casillas kept out attempts from Daniele De Rossi and Antonio Di Natale while Buffon failed to stop a single Spanish penalty as Luis Aragones' side progressed and went on to dominate international football for the next four years.\n\nTiki-taka sweeps Italy aside\n\nSpain got the better of Italy again four years later as an awesome display of tiki-taka football made La Roja the first team ever to retain a European Championship title.\n\nAlready reigning world champions, Spain confirmed their status as the pre-eminent force in world football by thumping an Italy team containing Buffon, Giorgio Chiellini, Andrea Pirlo and an inspired Mario Balotelli 4-0 in a one-sided final in Kyiv.\n\nBarcelona midfield trio Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Sergio Busquets passed teams to death in what turned out to be that generation's last hurrah on the international stage, as Spain won the Euros while only conceding one goal in open play all tournament.\n\nThat goal was scored by Di Natale in the 1-1 draw which started both Spain and Italy's Euros campaign.\n\nDonnarumma saves Italy\n\nGianluigi Donnarumma got some revenge for Buffon three years ago when his saves sent Italy past Spain and into the Euro 2020 final, where the Azzurri would win a thrilling final against England.\n\nAnother exciting match went to penalties after Alvaro Morata struck with 10 minutes remaining to cancel out Federico Chiesa's brilliant opener for the Italians.\n\nDonnarumma was the hero of a feverish night at Wembley as he saved Dani Olmo's opening penalty before denying Morata, allowing Jorginho to send Italy to the final with a nonchalant spot-kick.\n\nThe Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper would step up again in another shoot-out in the final as Italy won the Euros for the first time in over half a century.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

"Spain outclassed defending champions Italy and booked a place in the knockout stages of Euro 2024 with a 1-0 win that was settled by Riccardo Calafiori's own goal but could have ended in a much bigger victory for Luis de la Fuente's side.\n\nLa Roja, seeking revenge for their elimination from Euro 2020 by the Italians, put the Azzurri on the back foot from the kickoff, driving forward at every opportunity through irrepressible young wingers Nico Williams and Lamine Yamal.\n\nItaly's usually rock-steady defence was unable to stop the red tide and the deadlock was broken in the 55th minute when Williams fired in a cross from the left which glanced off Alvaro Morata's head and Donnarumma's outstretched glove before hitting Calafiori on the knee and going in.\n\nSpain will finish top of Group B regardless of the outcome of their last match in the opening phase against Albania on Monday, and will play a third-placed side from another group in the last 16.\n\nItaly must avoid defeat in their last group game against Croatia to guarantee qualification.\n\nEngland must wait to secure a berth in the knockout stage after a 1-1 draw with Denmark, a game that Harry Kane brought to life with an early goal but which ended with the Three Lions clinging on for a single point.\n\nIt was a second successive lacklustre performance from Gareth Southgate's men, who squandered the chance to become the first England team to win their two opening games at a Euro tournament.\n\nThe draw leaves the 2020 runners-up, previously touted as tournament favourites, at the top of Group C on four points, while Denmark are second on two after Slovenia's 1-1 draw with Serbia earlier.\n\nEngland take on Slovenia in their final group game on Tuesday, while the Danes take on Serbia on the

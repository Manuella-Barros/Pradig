The forces directed Israeli fighter jets who struck the compound and destroyed it. \u25a0 The amphibious assault ship USS Wasp entered the eastern Mediterranean Sea this week as the United States positions warships to try to keep fighting between Israel and Hezbollah from escalating into a wider war. \u25a0 State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said that Secretary of State Antony Blinken met on Thursday with UN Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza Sigrid Kaag in Washington, DC. \u25a0 According to Hamas sources, the exchange of gunfire in Gaza City occurs in the Shujaiya and Tuffah neighborhoods. \u25a0 The IDF said it struck targets in Hezbollah's air defense system, from which surface-to-air missiles were launched at an Israel Air Force aircraft. \u25a0 The pier built by the U.S. military to bring aid to Gaza has been removed due to weather to protect it, and the U.S. is considering not re-installing it unless the aid begins flowing out into the population again, several U.S. officials said Friday. \u25a0 The Israeli army says that three Hezbollah drones have infiltrated Israel from southern Lebanon and exploded in the Western Galilee after interception attempts failed. \u25a0 Iran has installed half the advanced uranium-enriching machines it said earlier this month it would quickly add to its Fordow site dug into a mountain, but has not yet brought them online, the UN nuclear watchdog said in a report seen by Reuters. \u25a0 Iran's Mission to UN posted on X that if Israel should \"embark on full-scale military aggression\" in Lebanon, \"an obliterating war will ensue. All options, including the full involvement of all Resistance Fronts, are on the table.\"", "summary": "U.S. amphibious assault ship USS Wasp entered the eastern Mediterranean Sea \u25a0 Israeli army says three drones, 25 rockets launched from southern Lebanon, no casualties reported \u25a0 IDF says it struck Hezbollah air defense system \u25a0 U.S. shifts assault ship to Mediterranean to deter risk of Israel-Lebanon conflict escalating \u25a0 IDF launches intelligence-based operation in Gaza City's Shujaiya neighborhood; Gazans report 30 killed", "url": "https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-06-29/ty-article-live/irans-mission-to-un-if-israel-attacks-lebanon-an-obliterating-war-will-ensue/00000190-61e4-d90c-a7fc-77e4c4ba0000", "image": "https://img.haarets.co.il/bs/00000190-61ee-d0b3-a7d1-63ee989d0000/ea/25/2927a69d4969afd78a35dae86db2/83881-2.jpg?height=630&width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 03:02:10", "author": "Haaretz", "authors": ["Haaretz"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "il", "sentiment": -0.314}

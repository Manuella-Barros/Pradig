I can't tell you exactly at this point because we're still firming that up, but in the background we're working really hard on Honda's movement into introducing battery electric [vehicles] into the Australian market.\"\n\nWhile Honda now offers a hybrid variant of every model in its local range, it has never sold an EV in Australia - though grey market imports of the now-defunct Honda e city car have occurred through third-party companies.\n\nAt present, Honda currently produces a limited selection of EVs in China, Europe, Thailand and, in partnership with General Motors, in Mexico.\n\nIt recently pulled the plug on the Europe-focused e hatchback but commenced exports of its Chinese e:Ny1 to Europe. The small crossover is also built in Thailand.\n\nThe carmaker plans to roll out a total of 30 EVs globally by 2030 with more models coming from Japan and other countries.\n\nHonda also announced it will invest CAD$15 billion (A$16.8 billion) along with an as-yet unnamed joint venture partner to establish an EV assembly and battery plant in Ontario, Canada for the North American market.\n\nWhen asked whether any of these regions had been shortlisted or ruled out as the source of Australian-bound EVs, Ms McMahon said supply will be based on which production line can cater to local compliance regulations.\n\n\"We'll draw from wherever we can to meet the compliance requirements of this market, and can meet the majority of consumer requirements from the market,\" Ms McMahon said.\n\n\"At the moment we're not ruling anything out, so unfortunately I can't comment on specifics today.\"\n\nOut of the nine Japanese carmakers operating in Australia, five sell EVs: Toyota, Lexus, Mazda, Nissan and Subaru. Suzuki, Isuzu Ute, Mitsubishi and Honda don't currently offer battery-electric vehicles to local buyers.\n\nMORE: Everything HondaMORE: Honda unveils three new electric cars in China\n\nOriginally published as When to expect Honda's first EVs in Australia\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails", "source": {"uri": "thewest.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The West Australian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_e", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Honda e"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-segment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A-segment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatchback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hatchback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isuzu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isuzu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nissan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crossover (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitsubishi Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lexus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suzuki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subaru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mazda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Motorcycles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Motorcycles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Classifieds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Maintenance", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Maintenance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-14561333/4cf4f9cc5578815521bf346e81008138fa6d84dc-16x9-x0y159w3057h1720.jpg?imwidth=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541540", "eventUri": "eng-9541540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Electric car plan gains pace but where will Honda source its BYD and Hyundai-fighting EV models from? - Car News", "body": "Celebrity favourite car brand returning to Oz: Cadillac to launch range of electric SUVs in Australia from the end of 2024\n\nHonda will launch electric cars in Australia sooner than previously thought.\n\nIt was widely reported early last year that Honda would not launch an EV until at least 2028, the company has clarified its position.\n\nSpeaking with journalists at the Accord launch, Honda Australia Director Carolyn McMahon said to expect battery electric Hondas in the coming years.\n\n\"In terms of when is it (EV) coming to Australia. I think this time last year we spoke about our mid-term plan, some pegged that at 2028. It'll be earlier than that,\" she said.\n\n\"I can't tell you exactly at this point because we are still firming that up, but in the background we're working hard on Honda's movement into introducing the battery electric into the Australian market. So when we've got further details that we can share, we'll share that with you but I just want to make the point that there's lots of development going on, lots of investment, and when we can announce that to you, we will.\"\n\nMcMahon added that Honda's current strategy has not changed, and the focus remains on hybrids for now, followed by a wider rollout of more electrified vehicles.\n\n\"Many of you often question in terms of where we are up to with electrification. And we've explained before that our strategy is very much a stepping stone from electric hybrid technology, through then to full battery electric vehicles. So we're still on that strategy. And we'll continue with that.\"\n\nShe also said Honda was watching what will happen with the Federal Government's New Vehicle Efficiency Standard (NVES), and what impact that has on the industry.\n\n\"In terms of NVES, we've still got to wait for it to pass two houses of parliament, that will take place in the next few months, we expect. So we're in discussion with government about what the impact will be for us. And I guess we're just really curious about how this is going to play out for the consumer.\n\n\"So yes, the industry can bring vehicles to market. What's the consumer demand? And I think what we're seeing is a really good take up of hybrid at the moment. Many people feel very comfortable stepping from ICE into hybrid, before investing into battery electric. So we'll be interested to see what that demand does once the new program is in place.\"\n\nIn terms of what sort of EVs Honda will introduce, and where the company will source them from, nothing is locked in just yet.\n\n\"So we will draw from wherever can meet the compliance requirements of this market, can meet the majority of consumer requirements for the market. So that's what's under discussion,\" McMahon said.\n\n\"At the moment we're not ruling anything in or out. Unfortunately, I can't comment on specifics today.\"\n\nHonda, globally, is trailing many of its competitors when it comes to its EV rollout. The company has had mixed success when it comes to EV partnerships, too.\n\nA major tie-up between Honda and American giant GM ended in October last year when the two automakers decided to shelve plans to develop affordable EVs. They had already finished development of the Honda Prologue that uses GM's Ultium EV architecture - this model has just gone on sale in the US.\n\nSince then Honda and Japanese rival Nissan have announced a partnership that will see them develop common electric powertrains and strive to produce more affordable EVs to better compete with Chinese competitors.\n\nHonda revealed a trio of new EVs in China recently, but the models - branded 'Ye' - are slated for the Chinese market only, for now. However they could become global models down the track.\n\nAnother avenue for sourcing Honda EVs for Australia, although less likely, is Canada. The company recently announced a significant investment for an EV plant and a battery plant in Ontario, Canada. Although it's unclear what models will be produced there.\n\nOther recent Honda concepts include the sleek 0 Series saloon that debuted at CES earlier this year.\n\nHonda sells an electric version of the HR-V in the UK, called the e:Ny1, but it starts from the equivalent of AUD$76,000, which would make it a very tough sell in Australia. The much admired Honda 'e' city hatch was also nixed for the Australian market, and it was recently discontinued globally.", "source": {"uri": "carsguide.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "CarsGuide"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cadillac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Prologue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Honda Prologue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ultium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nissan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_HR-V", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Honda HR-V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sedan (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Motorcycles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Motorcycles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Classifieds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Maintenance", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Maintenance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://carsguide-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto,t_default/v1/editorial/story/hero_image/2024-Honda-eNP2-1001x565-3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541540", "eventUri": "eng-9541540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

I can't tell you exactly at this point because we're still firming that up, but in the background we're working really hard on Honda's movement into introducing battery electric [vehicles] into the Australian market.\"\n\nWhile Honda now offers a hybrid variant of every model in its local range, it has never sold an EV in Australia - though grey market imports of the now-defunct Honda e city car have occurred through third-party companies.\n\nAt present, Honda currently produces a limited selection of EVs in China, Europe, Thailand and, in partnership with General Motors, in Mexico.\n\nIt recently pulled the plug on the Europe-focused e hatchback but commenced exports of its Chinese e:Ny1 to Europe. The small crossover is also built in Thailand.\n\nThe carmaker plans to roll out a total of 30 EVs globally by 2030 with more models coming from Japan and other countries.\n\nHonda also announced it will invest CAD$15 billion (A$16.8 billion) along with an as-yet unnamed joint venture partner to establish an EV assembly and battery plant in Ontario, Canada for the North American market.\n\nWhen asked whether any of these regions had been shortlisted or ruled out as the source of Australian-bound EVs, Ms McMahon said supply will be based on which production line can cater to local compliance regulations.\n\n\"We'll draw from wherever we can to meet the compliance requirements of this market, and can meet the majority of consumer requirements from the market,\" Ms McMahon said.\n\n\"At the moment we're not ruling anything out, so unfortunately I can't comment on specifics today.\"\n\nOut of the nine Japanese carmakers operating in Australia, five sell EVs: Toyota, Lexus, Mazda, Nissan and Subaru. Suzuki, Isuzu Ute, Mitsubishi and Honda don't currently offer battery-electric vehicles to local buyers.", "source": {"uri": "7news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "7NEWS.com.au"}, "authors":

It could have happened if it didn't make a drastic change to how it runs its business - Car News", "body": "Subaru's legacy lives on: 10 times the Subaru Liberty reshaped the auto world in ways no Holden Commodore, Ford Falcon, Toyota Camry or Honda Accord managed\n\nHonda was in danger of withdrawing from the Australian market if it didn't make a drastic change to its business model, according to the brand's local boss.\n\nThe Japanese carmaker switched from a traditional dealer model to an 'agency' model midway through 2021. Under this model, Honda Australia - rather than the dealers - owns the vehicle stock, while dealers still conduct test drives and manage servicing.\n\nThe model allowed Honda to move to national drive-away pricing and prompted a significant consolidation of its dealer network.\n\nHonda's move was controversial and prompted backlash from some dealers. It also resulted in a sizeable sales slide, with registrations dropping by 68 per cent from 2019 to 2023.\n\nSpeaking with journalists at the Australian debut of the 11th-generation Accord, Honda Australia Director Carolyn McMahon said the shift to an agency model was necessary to ensure the survival of the iconic brand.\n\n\"So one of the reasons we changed our business model was really because if we didn't, the survival of the franchise going forward was under a big question mark,\" she said.\n\n\"And the profitability of our business partners is really, really key because, you know, during COVID years they had a sugar hit in the industry, you know the industry has done very, very well. But we're seeing very, very quickly those grosses starting to come down and we think the original design of our system will more and more come into play.\"\n\nMuch has been written about Honda's sales decline, but Honda executives have consistently stated an agency model allows the company to be leaner and more profitable. It no longer chases high volume and low margins, rather, the company focuses on sustainable growth.\n\nFor reference, in 2019 the brand's year-end tally was 43,868, but in 2023 it sold 13,734 units.\n\nBack in 2019, Honda had eight models in its line-up, and it has since consolidated that down to five. The core models are three SUVs - the HR-V, ZR-V and CR-V - with the Civic and Accord passenger cars playing supporting roles.\n\nMcMahon reiterated that Honda had no intention of pursuing a return to the top-10 best-selling brands anytime soon, or chasing outright volume, as it is not consistent with the brand's strategy.\n\nAt the end of the first quarter of 2024, Honda has sold just under 4700 cars, which would put its year-end total at or close to 20,000 units.\n\nWithout nominating an annual target, McMahon suggested that the current sales level is roughly what can be expected going forward.\n\n\"Yeah around that mark, but you've got to interplay that with what's happening with competition and cost-of-living pressures as well. So that level of pace is where we would hope to be going forward.\"\n\nWhen asked if more could be done to get the message out to buyers about Honda's widely praised model line-up, McMahon acknowledged the challenges the company has faced since announcing the shift to an agency model, but spoke proudly about the resilience and reputation of Honda in Australia.\n\n\"We took a leadership position in the industry to consolidate the business to right-size the business and to put us in a more sustainable position. So we've done that. It was really tough, obviously with COVID and the lack of supply, it hampered our ability to get to the volumes that we originally hoped to be at.\n\n\"So, you know, there's lots of commentary around 'Honda's fallen off a cliff'. Honda's still here, we're not going away. We want to make sure that we're here for the future. And we will, step-by-step, just get this model working well.\n\n\"We can do more in telling the consumer about our product, we can do more telling the consumer about the value of the 'one-price promise', the quality of their vehicle.\n\n\"We've been around 75 years globally. We've been in this country for 53 years. Our quality and reliability is second to none, and maybe we've just got to do a better job at communicating that.\"", "source": {"uri": "carsguide.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "CarsGuide"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holden_Commodore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holden Commodore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Falcon_(Australia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ford Falcon (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_Legacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subaru Legacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Accord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Honda Accord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Camry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toyota Camry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subaru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_HR-V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Honda HR-V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_CR-V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Honda CR-V"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Motorcycles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Motorcycles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Classifieds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Maintenance", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Maintenance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Performance_Tuning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Performance Tuning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://carsguide-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto,t_default/v1/editorial/story/hero_image/2022-Honda-Civic-VTi-LX-Hatch-Red-1001x565-(1).jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541540", "eventUri": "eng-9541540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Encouraged by GM's success with its solar racer, Honda started its journey on a program to introduce a practical EV to the market that could be powered via stand-alone solar systems. Honda was the last Japanese carmaker to start working towards producing an electric vehicle but ended up releasing its first attempt in 1997.\n\nGoogle News\n\nAdd TopSpeed to your Google News feed.\n\nAs you can imagine, the timeline of moving a vehicle from a basic idea into sheet metal, batteries, and the final production line is challenging, but in addition to new advancements and innovation, it's a cornerstone for modern EVs and all-electric concepts, such as an all-electric Type R. Fortunately, Honda documented this process in its entirety, saving it all for posterity's sake. So, for the die-hard Honda EV fan, we've collected the most essential details of this journey for you to see for yourself.\n\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from Honda\n\nRelated 10 Electric Cars From The 1990s You've Probably Forgotten About EVs may have picked up steam in the last decade or so, but they have been around for long. Here are 10 EVs from the '90s you may not remember.\n\nEarly Challenges And Goals In Developing EVs\n\nClose\n\nHonda started developing an EV in April 1988 with the intent to meet future stringent emissions standards. The carmaker's first electric vehicle team was made up of only four people at the time. They discovered some early obstacles during the beginning stages of the development process. Powerful or efficient electric traction motors were too big to fit, had low energy storage density via existing lead-acid technology, and the time needed to recharge was too inconvenient.\n\nAlong with technical challenges, California issued a Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate in late 1990, meaning that car manufacturers needed to sell two-percent of total sales as ZEVs, which was to start in 1998. Keeping this in mind, Honda devoted around 100 employees to start its full-scale electric vehicle development in early 1991.\n\nDevelopment Of EV Battery Systems\n\nThe team at Honda had no experience in EV technology and doubted that batteries could provide the necessary power to give owners a decent range when driving. During early driving tests, Honda discovered that early prototypes' lead-acid batteries would deteriorate fast when left in the summer heat for a couple of weeks. These details helped the company determine that there was a need to switch batteries with a stress-resistant, nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) battery system, which was significantly advanced for the time. This Ni-MH batter was being co-created with an electrical manufacturer.\n\nRelated The Different Type Of Electric Car Batteries Explained From lithium-ion lightning to solid-state serenity, electric car batteries power a silent revolution.\n\nMastering Key EV Technology\n\nThe significant amount of research done by the Research and Development team at Honda focused on two main components: batteries and motors. Several research managers within the Honda R&D Center held a meeting where they debated the types of research they need to conduct for the coming 21st century. This was a critical meeting because their target was to be an age of clean energy. They knew they were working in advance of the time when the world's petroleum reserves would run out, and everyone in attendance at this meeting needed to share this sentiment.\n\nDuring the meeting, the team also discussed several challenges. However, everyone involved was mindful of the fact that EVs required fewer parts than gas-powered vehicles. This prompted them to look at the possibility of their EVs being easily manufactured anywhere worldwide. They finalized this meeting by reconfirming the necessity of enhancing EV technology and dedicating future product developments to environmental protection - and the most likely candidate for alternative power was electric vehicle technology.\n\nEvolution Of Battery Technology\n\nThe engineers on the team were determined to create an efficient battery that was also small enough to be effectively used in a car. During this time, electric operations were associated with golf carts and amusement park rides, and it took many hours to recharge a battery. This made it a hassle to use these technologies in other applications.\n\nDuring its collaboration with battery manufacturers, Honda's Ni-MH battery format later became an industry standard around the globe. When taking up the challenge of developing an EV, Honda considered participating in the World Solar Challenge race because they knew a race would provide the harsh conditions necessary to produce their battery technology faster.\n\n3:23 Related 10 Battery Technologies Currently In Development Battery tech is a critical section of electric vehicles today, and the continuous evolution of batteries will continue to transform the industry.\n\nUnconventional Choice Of DC Brushless Motor\n\nHonda's decision to use a DC brushless motor in the EV Plus was met with skepticism at first because it was rarely used in large motor applications. However, the commercially available motor options at the time weren't efficient enough. However, Honda's engineering team was driven by several simulations and performance tests, which led to their choosing this motor type.\n\nBy June 1992, Honda started working to develop a purpose-built DC brushless motor prototype. After various testing scenarios, the choice of using the DC brushless motor was proved successful. These results also set a new motor technology benchmark that influenced the competition to adopt similar technologies in its EVs.\n\nIntensive Efforts to Increase Motor Efficiency\n\nAt the time, there wasn't any motor in an electric vehicle that was in any way the same as the ones found in conventional cars. There was no motor that was compact enough with enough output or efficiency to be put into an electric vehicle. Improving the DC brushless motor's efficiency was a challenging task that involved countless testing hours, modifications, and real-world trials. Honda's commitment to this process showed the world its dedication to innovation. In the end, the carmaker developed a motor that exceeded initial expectations and contributed to the overall efficiency and performance of Honda's EVs.\n\nRelated The Three Different Types Of Electric Car Motors And How They Work Explore the mechanics and benefits of the three varied electric car motors in today's EVs.\n\nExploration Of Battery Types For Energy Sources\n\nHonda's search for the ideal battery type led the brand to explore options other than the traditional lead-acid batteries. This was crucial to identifying and developing batteries with higher energy densities and faster charging times. The EV Plus served as a test of Honda's advanced battery chemistry in electric cars. It's an excellent example of battery EVs leading the technology curve. Even while Honda was introducing the EV Plus, it was working hard on its program to bring a hybrid vehicle to U.S. showrooms before the turn of the century.\n\nPotential For Future Advancements In EV Technology\n\nAs modern technology continues to advance, the possibilities for future EV technology advancements are significant. Honda stays ahead of the game on this innovation by regularly seeking out new methodologies that may further revolutionize how the public thinks about and engages with EVs. This includes creating EV batteries with a longer use life and shorter charge times. Honda can also use this experience and the information they collect to further technologies for hybrid electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles as well as fuel cell electric vehicles.\n\nRelated 10 Technologies In EVs And The Vehicles That Pioneered Each Of Them A more sustainable and technology-driven future can be assured with electric vehicles.\n\nWhat EVs Does Honda Make Now?\n\nAt this moment, Honda only sells one all-electric EV in North America, the Honda Prologue. However, it has plans to launch multiple EVs worldwide over the coming years. This includes a possible plan for an electrified Honda Civic Type R. Internationally, Honda used to produce the Honda e throughout Europe and Japan but has recently decided to stop selling the pint-sized EV.\n\nGoals For Clean, Quiet, And Advanced EVs\n\nIn 2017, Honda created a new division dedicated to solely focusing on creating fully electric vehicles. The goal Honda set for its EVs was ambitious: to manufacture an environmentally friendly driving experience. This means developing EVs that are efficient and powerful and offer the comforts that potential customers expect from a premium brand. Honda's executives believe that battery EVs and fuel-cell cars will account for 15-percent of the company's electrified cars.", "source": {"uri": "topspeed.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Top Speed"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aaron_grainger@topspeed.com", "name": "Aaron Grainger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_EV_Plus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Honda EV Plus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Type_R", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Honda Type R"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel\u2013metal_hydride_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nickel\u2013metal hydride battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Solar_Challenge", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Solar Challenge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead\u2013acid_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lead\u2013acid battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushless_DC_electric_motor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brushless DC electric motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-emissions_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zero-emissions vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Direct current"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunraycer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunraycer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_motor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Traction motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Production line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Density"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_storage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy storage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_in_Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Honda in Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Electromechanical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Electromechanical", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Power_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Power Supplies", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Associations", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://static1.topspeedimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/honda-ev-plus.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541540", "eventUri": "eng-9541540", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1992-06-", "textStart": 5711, "textEnd": 5720}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

It also has fixed pricing nationwide.\n\nThe brand subsequently posted its two weakest sales years on record in Australia, dropping from 29,040 vehicles sold in 2020 (the last full year before going non-negotiable) to 14,215 sales in 2022, and 13,734 sales in 2023.\n\nHonda has recorded an 18.9 per cent increase in sales in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year, reporting 4683 cars as sold in Australia.\n\nHowever, this is largely attributable to the arrival of the ZR-V SUV, which wasn't yet on sale in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nWhile the fixed price model has been criticised for the resulting sheer drop in the brand's volume of sales, Honda Australia director Carolyn McMahon says the carmaker is still in a strong position with no plans to return to negotiable prices and franchises.\n\n\"[The] agency [model] continues to work well for us. Our Honda Centres are loving it,\" Ms McMahon said at the Australian launch of the new Accord.\n\n\"Our Honda Centres are enjoying some of the benefits of agency [model] with interest rate increases, floor plan costs many of the players in the industry are having to deal with at the moment.\n\n\"They're quite happy with the fact that they don't have to hold the inventory and that's now a Honda responsibility.\n\n\"One of the reasons we changed our business model was really because if we didn't, the survival of the franchise was under a big question and the profitability of our business partners is key as well.\n\n\"During COVID years they had a sugar hit and the industry has done very, very well. But we are seeing very quickly they're starting to come down and we think the original design of our system will come more into play.\"\n\nWith the rising cost of living also affecting the car industry, Honda sees itself as a protector of its dealers, given it wears the fluctuating costs rather than the owners of a franchise.\n\n\"There's a lot of financial cost pressure on dealerships at the moment.

However, they weren't the only ones. Europeans likewise didn't appreciate the name, nor the odd choice of punctuation and capitalization that seems to plague some all-electric vehicles.\n\nYour author has a admittedly ludicrous theory that some manufacturers have been giving compliance EVs terrible names because they subconsciously hope that people won't buy them. This is pure speculation, obviously, and probably incorrect. But it's difficult to imagine the meetings where they settled on Toyota bZ4X or Honda e:Ny1 ending in anything other than some soft crying.\n\nOfficially, the e:N prefix is supposed to stand for the new electric platform that will underpin Honda's all-electric vehicles in the coming years (watch that change) and the y1 is the model designation. But this is even worse than when companies (e.g. Polestar or Tesla) simply give each model a single number or letter to identify itself. Besides, Honda already has a complete lineup of vehicles with excellent names -- making the alphanumeric stuff that more confusing.\n\nDespite nobody really digging the moniker, Honda has told Autocar that it only plans on changing the name of the model in China (as part of a more comprehensive facelift) because that's where they're having the most trouble and anticipated the largest sales volumes. But there have been rumors it might see its name change elsewhere, too.\n\n\"Customers in China just can't pronounce it,\" explained the source.\n\nIn China, Honda uses either the e:NS1 or e:NP1 name for its small electric SUV, depending on whether the car is made by its joint venture with Dongfeng or that with GAC, while in Europe it uses e:Ny1.\n\nUnder the new naming scheme, Honda in China has kept the P and S letters depending on which joint venture builds the car, meaning it could in Europe rename the car the Y1.\n\nKeeping the Y element would also avoid awkward conversions with McLaren or Audi if using the P1 or S1 name.\n\nAudi has been very protective of its naming system, last year forcing Chinese EV maker Nio to change the name of its ES6 and ES8 SUVs on the basis that they sounded too much like S6 and S8.\n\nThe new P7/S7 is the first of Honda's new Ye Series cars, based on a newly developed EV-specific platform. Honda has said it will launch a total of 10 new EVs in China by 2027.\n\nIf this sounds confusing, it's because Honda actually wants to distinguish its all-electric models from the rest of its fleet. The brand believes it can sell EVs in China and simultaneously move EVs upmarket. Frankly, that sounds like an insane gamble if it were being done inside North America. But China sees EV proliferation as the best way to overtake the automotive industry, giving Honda an arguably better chance there.\n\nWhile other nations have historically dominated the automotive detector, China currently rules the battery market without any direct peers. By doing what it can to pivot the whole world toward all-electric vehicles, it's putting itself in a good position to become globally relevant in terms of automotive construction. Truth be told, the sheer number of parts suppliers situated within the nation already make China an essential part of most vehicle's supply chain. However, the Chinese government feels like the path forward is to create global EV brands that will out-compete legacy manufacturers from other countries.\n\nMarket conditions have changed quite a bit in recent years as the economy weakened. But most companies still see China as one of the few markets where small, affordable EVs have a chance of turning a profit. Unfortunately, this also meant the market was flooded with those exact types of models -- making the segment very competitive with leaner margins than most automakers would have hoped for. Oversupplying has become a problem, meaning Honda is going to need every advantage it can get if it wants to stay in the fight.\n\nSadly, Autocar stated that the brand is already having difficulties here as loads of Chinese EV brands continue going under. The e:NS2 mid-size hatchback that was recently launched in China is reportedly being sold at a substantial loss and went to market with the naming convention the company is now considering abandoning.\n\nMeanwhile, the relatively small e:Ny1 that also presently sells in the United Kingdom for \u00a339,995 (roughly $50,200 USD at the current exchange rate) is being heavily discounted to ensure the company hits regional emissions targets after opting not to sell the even smaller Honda E. That presumably isn't solely the result of it having a lackluster name and likely has more to do with the fact that that's fairly expensive for the segment it's trying to occupy. That's something we have seen on our market and more than occasionally.", "source": {"uri": "thetruthaboutcars.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Truth About Cars"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_bZ4X", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toyota bZ4X"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polestar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polestar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Audi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nio_Inc.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nio Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocar_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autocar (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongfeng_Motor_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dongfeng Motor Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_S6", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Audi S6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAC_Group", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GAC Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facelift_(automotive)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facelift (automotive)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatchback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hatchback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-size_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mid-size car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Motorcycles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Motorcycles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Classifieds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Maintenance", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Maintenance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Performance_Tuning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Performance Tuning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://cdn-fastly.thetruthaboutcars.com/media/2024/05/06/15411/report-honda-e-ny1-to-drop-terrible-name.jpg?size=1200x628", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541540", "eventUri": "eng-9541540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Encouraged by GM's success with its solar racer, Honda started its journey on a program to introduce a practical EV to the market that could be powered via stand-alone solar systems. Honda was the last Japanese carmaker to start working towards producing an electric vehicle but ended up releasing its first attempt in 1997.\n\nTOPSPEED VIDEO OF THE DAY\n\nSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nGoogle News\n\nAdd TopSpeed to your Google News feed.\n\nAs you can imagine, the timeline of moving a vehicle from a basic idea into sheet metal, batteries, and the final production line is challenging, but in addition to new advancements and innovation, it's a cornerstone for modern EVs and all-electric concepts, such as an all-electric Type R. Fortunately, Honda documented this process in its entirety, saving it all for posterity's sake. So, for the die-hard Honda EV fan, we've collected the most essential details of this journey for you to see for yourself.\n\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from Honda\n\nRelated 10 Electric Cars From The 1990s You've Probably Forgotten About\n\nEVs may have picked up steam in the last decade or so, but they have been around for long. Here are 10 EVs from the '90s you may not remember.\n\nEarly Challenges And Goals In Developing EVs\n\nHonda started developing an EV in April 1988 with the intent to meet future stringent emissions standards. The carmaker's first electric vehicle team was made up of only four people at the time. They discovered some early obstacles during the beginning stages of the development process. Powerful or efficient electric traction motors were too big to fit, had low energy storage density via existing lead-acid technology, and the time needed to recharge was too inconvenient.\n\nAlong with technical challenges, California issued a Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate in late 1990, meaning that car manufacturers needed to sell two-percent of total sales as ZEVs, which was to start in 1998. Keeping this in mind, Honda devoted around 100 employees to start its full-scale electric vehicle development in early 1991.\n\nDevelopment Of EV Battery Systems\n\nThe team at Honda had no experience in EV technology and doubted that batteries could provide the necessary power to give owners a decent range when driving. During early driving tests, Honda discovered that early prototypes' lead-acid batteries would deteriorate fast when left in the summer heat for a couple of weeks. These details helped the company determine that there was a need to switch batteries with a stress-resistant, nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) battery system, which was significantly advanced for the time. This Ni-MH batter was being co-created with an electrical manufacturer.\n\nRelated The Different Type Of Electric Car Batteries Explained\n\nFrom lithium-ion lightning to solid-state serenity, electric car batteries power a silent revolution.\n\nMastering Key EV Technology\n\nThe significant amount of research done by the Research and Development team at Honda focused on two main components: batteries and motors. Several research managers within the Honda R&D Center held a meeting where they debated the types of research they need to conduct for the coming 21st century. This was a critical meeting because their target was to be an age of clean energy. They knew they were working in advance of the time when the world's petroleum reserves would run out, and everyone in attendance at this meeting needed to share this sentiment.\n\nDuring the meeting, the team also discussed several challenges. However, everyone involved was mindful of the fact that EVs required fewer parts than gas-powered vehicles. This prompted them to look at the possibility of their EVs being easily manufactured anywhere worldwide. They finalized this meeting by reconfirming the necessity of enhancing EV technology and dedicating future product developments to environmental protection - and the most likely candidate for alternative power was electric vehicle technology.\n\nEvolution Of Battery Technology\n\nThe engineers on the team were determined to create an efficient battery that was also small enough to be effectively used in a car. During this time, electric operations were associated with golf carts and amusement park rides, and it took many hours to recharge a battery. This made it a hassle to use these technologies in other applications.\n\nDuring its collaboration with battery manufacturers, Honda's Ni-MH battery format later became an industry standard around the globe. When taking up the challenge of developing an EV, Honda considered participating in the World Solar Challenge race because they knew a race would provide the harsh conditions necessary to produce their battery technology faster.\n\n3:23\n\nRelated 10 Battery Technologies Currently In Development\n\nBattery tech is a critical section of electric vehicles today, and the continuous evolution of batteries will continue to transform the industry.\n\nUnconventional Choice Of DC Brushless Motor\n\nHonda's decision to use a DC brushless motor in the EV Plus was met with skepticism at first because it was rarely used in large motor applications. However, the commercially available motor options at the time weren't efficient enough. However, Honda's engineering team was driven by several simulations and performance tests, which led to their choosing this motor type.\n\nBy June 1992, Honda started working to develop a purpose-built DC brushless motor prototype. After various testing scenarios, the choice of using the DC brushless motor was proved successful. These results also set a new motor technology benchmark that influenced the competition to adopt similar technologies in its EVs.\n\nIntensive Efforts to Increase Motor Efficiency\n\nAt the time, there wasn't any motor in an electric vehicle that was in any way the same as the ones found in conventional cars. There was no motor that was compact enough with enough output or efficiency to be put into an electric vehicle. Improving the DC brushless motor's efficiency was a challenging task that involved countless testing hours, modifications, and real-world trials. Honda's commitment to this process showed the world its dedication to innovation. In the end, the carmaker developed a motor that exceeded initial expectations and contributed to the overall efficiency and performance of Honda's EVs.\n\nRelated The Three Different Types Of Electric Car Motors And How They Work\n\nExplore the mechanics and benefits of the three varied electric car motors in today's EVs.\n\nExploration Of Battery Types For Energy Sources\n\nHonda's search for the ideal battery type led the brand to explore options other than the traditional lead-acid batteries. This was crucial to identifying and developing batteries with higher energy densities and faster charging times. The EV Plus served as a test of Honda's advanced battery chemistry in electric cars. It's an excellent example of battery EVs leading the technology curve. Even while Honda was introducing the EV Plus, it was working hard on its program to bring a hybrid vehicle to U.S. showrooms before the turn of the century.\n\nPotential For Future Advancements In EV Technology\n\nAs modern technology continues to advance, the possibilities for future EV technology advancements are significant. Honda stays ahead of the game on this innovation by regularly seeking out new methodologies that may further revolutionize how the public thinks about and engages with EVs. This includes creating EV batteries with a longer use life and shorter charge times. Honda can also use this experience and the information they collect to further technologies for hybrid electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles as well as fuel cell electric vehicles.\n\nRelated 10 Technologies In EVs And The Vehicles That Pioneered Each Of Them\n\nA more sustainable and technology-driven future can be assured with electric vehicles.\n\nWhat EVs Does Honda Make Now?\n\nAt this moment, Honda only sells one all-electric EV in North America, the Honda Prologue. However, it has plans to launch multiple EVs worldwide over the coming years. This includes a possible plan for an electrified Honda Civic Type R. Internationally, Honda used to produce the Honda e throughout Europe and Japan but has recently decided to stop selling the pint-sized EV.\n\nGoals For Clean, Quiet, And Advanced EVs\n\nIn 2017, Honda created a new division dedicated to solely focusing on creating fully electric vehicles. The goal Honda set for its EVs was ambitious: to manufacture an environmentally friendly driving experience. This means developing EVs that are efficient and powerful and offer the comforts that potential customers expect from a premium brand. Honda's executives believe that battery EVs and fuel-cell cars will account for 15-percent of the company's electrified cars.\n\nREAD SOURCE", "source": {"uri": "businesstelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel\u2013metal_hydride_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nickel\u2013metal hydride battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_EV_Plus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Honda EV Plus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Solar_Challenge", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Solar Challenge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead\u2013acid_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lead\u2013acid battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushless_DC_electric_motor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brushless DC electric motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-emissions_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zero-emissions vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Direct current"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunraycer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunraycer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_motor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Traction motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Type_R", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Honda Type R"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Density"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytona_International_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daytona International Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_storage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy storage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_in_Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Honda in Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Motorcycles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Motorcycles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Classifieds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Maintenance", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Maintenance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Performance_Tuning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Performance Tuning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.businesstelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1714955490_Story-Of-The-Honda-EV-Plus-And-How-It-Led.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541540", "eventUri": "eng-9541540", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1992-06-", "textStart": 5640, "textEnd": 5649}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The software, built in tandem with the Perkins School for the Blind's Howe Innovation Center, leverages artificial intelligence to help Blind and low vision people \"expand the joy of the journey by creating and narrating nuanced real-time scenic audio descriptions of the world outside their car window.\"\n\nHonda and Perkins boast in the announcement Honda Scenic Audio is the \"first AI-powered accessibility app built to enhance journeys in cars and other modes of transportation for the blind and visually impaired.\"\n\nAccording to Honda, Honda Scenic Audio has been made to use computer vision, generative AI, satellite imaging, and other technologies -- including weather reports -- to create what what the company characterized as \"a meticulously detailed, scenic narrative of what is taking place outside of the car window on a road trip or scenic drive, going beyond the basics of dictating the scenery.\" Moreover, the app was built to \"create multifaceted narratives with a literary tone and expressive descriptions with nuanced adjectives, recognizable sounds, comparisons of heights and terrain and even the temperature outside.\"\n\nIn essence, what the app does is make looking out the window a more accessible pastime to Blind and low vision people while on road trips. Honda has a video on YouTube showing Honda Scenic Audio in action.\n\n\"Our goal is to ensure that every passenger has the same equity as the driver when it comes to a road trip experience, and even with advancements in digital services and navigation, real-time multifaceted scenic descriptions on the road aren't available for blind and visually impaired passengers,\" Phil Hruska, senior manager of marketing at American Honda, said to me about the impetus to build Honda Scenic Audio in a recent interview conducted over email. \"Honda wanted to explore an app with that could help provide Blind and visually impaired passengers a more joyful and robust experience on the road.\"\n\nHruska explained Honda Scenic Audio is emblematic of the company's so-called \"Power of Dreams\" ethos, saying the philosophy \"applies original technologies and ideas to enable our customers to enjoy life with more freedom, convenience and fun.\" He added Honda's institutional values on diversity and inclusion are rooted in \"human respect... we are committed to living our values through actions that strengthen fairness, justice and equity in our workplace and in our relationship with society.\"\n\n\"We believe our differences can make us stronger and that a diverse workforce is the key to innovation,\" Hruska said. \"That's why we've long strived to bring together people who represent different cultures, backgrounds, race, gender, and sexual orientation to work as one team.\"\n\nIn developing and testing Honda Scenic Audio, Hruska told me Honda worked closely with members of the Blind and low vision community. He noted one person in particular, Dr. Josh Loebner. Loebner, who is Blind, is a disability advocate and global head at VML Inclusive Design, worked with creatives on the framework for the app along with another team to help \"tell the story from the perspective of visually impaired passengers.\" Elsewhere, reiterated talking points from Honda's announcement that the company worked with the Perkins School for the Blind, as well as the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind. The latter's role in beta-testing is the latest mark of a partnership that dates back nearly three decades.\n\nWhen asked about feedback, Hruska said Honda's goal right now is using this limited release period -- akin to Apple's aptly-named TestFlight service -- as a way to \"answer questions about feature development and scalability,\" adding it will aid in determining how much more development time is necessary before a public 1.0 version can be released to the general public. Overall, Hruska noted feedback has been positive and has given the development team \"so much to explore.\"\n\n\"Through our beta testers, we've found Honda Scenic Audio can be helpful on a business trip in a cab, an errand or even a familiar neighborhood,\" he said of discoveries made in testing. \"There's an aspect of landmarks used for orientation that can translate into everyday use.\"\n\nIf the idea of accessible sightseeing sounds familiar, it should. Last August, I posted an interview with Autio CEO Woody Sears, whose company has an app with a similar conceit to Honda Scenic Audio.

It was a technological tour de force\n\nSummary\n\nHonda's CX500 Turbo was the world's first production turbocharged motorcycle, showcasing Honda's engineering capabilities. The CX500 Turbo featured innovative technology like liquid cooling, fuel injection, and a unique shaft final drive system. Despite its complexity, the CX500 Turbo was surprisingly normal to ride and maintain, showcasing Honda's reliability and engineering prowess.\n\nHonda is the world's largest two-wheeler manufacturer, and it does the sales figures it does largely on the back of small capacity, reliable runabouts in third-world countries. However, at the other end of the spectrum, it is also one of the most successful brands in motorcycle racing. Its engineering is so capable that it can make a motorcycle of whatever type it wants to, without worrying about the product's financial return. The company has repeatedly tried to prove the latter, and one of the boldest proofs is the CX series: the CX500 Turbo. Or commonly known as the world's first production turbocharged motorcycle.\n\nBut that's not the only way you can define this beast. It featured an engine that Honda put on sale for a mere five years, but the lessons learned from it are being used by Honda (and everyone else) to this day. So let's take a closer look at the CX500 Turbo, and why it was important not just for turbocharged motorcycles, but also for the world of two-wheelers.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, the information compiled in this article was sourced from the manufacturer, as well as other authoritative sources such as Cycleworld.com, Motorcycle.com, Motorcyclenews.com, and Visordown.com.\n\nRelated History And Mystery Of The Honda V65 Magna Honda's Magna-ficent marvel of the 80s that set the stage for power cruisers\n\nThe Background\n\nThe Reason Behind The Turbos\n\nClose\n\nThe 1980s saw Japanese manufacturers blossom and their reliable, sweet-handling motorcycles took precedence over good ol' torquey American Iron. The US government under Reagan then imposed a crippling import tariff on essentially Japanese imports above 700 cc to protect American motorcycle makers from having to shut shop because of their lack of competitiveness. This made the Japanese innovate and try to offer equivalent performance to American manufacturers (namely Harley-Davidson) and their large displacement engines by other means. This 'other means' was forced induction for middleweight motorcycles, and all four Japanese manufacturers got in on the idea.\n\nIn a few years, the tariff was lifted and there was no need for the special Japanese turbocharged motorcycle to exist anymore. However, there was a race among the Japanese manufacturers to be the first one to respond to the American tariffs, not to mention to be the first production turbocharged motorcycle in history. Honda won that race with the CX500 Turbo, beating Kawasaki, Suzuki, and Yamaha.\n\nThe Firsts\n\nA Lot Of Game-Changing Tidbits\n\nA little bit of context is needed here. When the CX series was launched at the end of the 70s, we were only a few years removed from the Vietnam War. Heck, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was lording it over his peers at the time. Tube amps provided amplification for everyone because transistors hadn't quite taken over yet. With this backdrop in mind, let's take a look at the CX series' features, and then the Turbo in particular.\n\nThis wasn't the first water-cooled production engine Honda had made, but it was close, only beaten by the Gold Wing launched in 1974. This makes the CX series one of the first ones to have liquid cooling -- a game-changing technology that changed motorcycling forever. Moving on, it was definitely the first V-twin that Honda had made, armed with pushrods -- a necessary inclusion because of other decisions Honda made.\n\nHonda chose an 80-degree transverse v-twin, keeping the engine layout longitudinal like the Gold Wing, and gave it a shaft final drive to make it a good tourer. Shafts require no maintenance other than a regular oil change, unlike a chain that needs to be cleaned, lubricated, and adjusted every so often. It also picked up the contra-rotating gearbox tech from the luxury tourer. This allowed the motorcycle to resist the side-to-side rocking that we get from motorcycles with longitudinal engines when the throttle is opened and closed.\n\nTo keep the downpipes from fouling with the rider's legs and to keep heat away from them, Honda chose to rotate them by 22 degrees. This made it impossible to use the usual cam chain and overhead camshaft, so a single camshaft sat at the base of the engine's V and operated pushrods. The naturally aspirated CX500 had carburetors, but the CX500TC Turbo had fuel injection, which became a first for Honda (and just two years after the first fuel injection system on a production motorcycle). With the inclusion of the turbo, you had 64 percent more power than the normal CX500.\n\nThe chassis side of things wasn't far behind the engine's; the engine was a stressed member of the frame and hung from it like a modern sports bike. The CX500's modular wheels were unique for the time, and they allowed the motorcycle to be fitted with tubeless tires - another uncommon feature of that era. The suspension, meanwhile, was space-age for the time; the front forks ran with compressed air, and the brake calipers, when they gripped the disc, actuated an anti-dive system.\n\nAt the rear, the now-famous Pro-Link rear suspension made its debut on a production Honda bike. In a move that would be unheard of today, the CX500 TC Turbo also had an instrument cluster that was completely different from the standard CX500. It had digital components that gave the rider warnings when something went wrong with either the turbocharging or injection system.\n\nEngine Type\n\nLongitudinal 60-degree v-twin, turbocharged\n\nDisplacement\n\n498 cc\n\nCompression Ratio\n\n7.2:1\n\nPower\n\n82 HP @ 8,000 RPM\n\nTorque\n\n58.2 LB-FT @ 5,000 RPM\n\nTop Speed\n\n128 MPH\n\nFrame Type\n\nTubular steel backbone, engine as a stressed member\n\nFront Suspension\n\nShowa forks, 37 mm, auto adjustment for anti dive (TRAC)\n\nRear Suspension\n\nHonda Pro-Link with Showa rear shock, adjustable preload and rebound with air pressure\n\nSuspension Travel\n\n5.1 inches front/ 4.1 inches rear\n\nWheels\n\nAlloy wheels (modular)\n\nFront Tire Size\n\n100/90 18\n\nRear Tire Size\n\n120/95 17\n\nFront Brakes\n\nDual 280 mm discs, floating 2 piston calipers, linked TRAC anti-dive system\n\nRear Brakes\n\n300 mm disc, floating 2 piston caliper\n\nTank Capacity\n\n5.2 gallons\n\nClaimed Fuel Economy\n\n47 MPG\n\nTank Range\n\n244 Miles\n\nCurb weight\n\n485 LBS (dry)\n\nThe Result\n\nSurprisingly Normal\n\nDespite all the complexity and the many firsts, especially with the turbocharging, the Honda CX500 Turbo was as normal as any other motorcycle for the time to ride and maintain, with the exception of the turbo lag. It was reliable, smooth, and truly remarkable. The latter is a big deal because even today, when someone launches brand new tech, especially when it is as complex as fuel injection and turbocharging, there are always some hiccups before it runs smoothly. For Honda to launch something this complex and have it run so well is worth every last bit of praise it can get. Today. there are owner clubs of the CX series not limited to the Turbos, but the blown ones deservedly get the respect and appreciation due to them.\n\nRelated Why The 2024 Honda Gold Wing Offers The Ultimate Luxurious Touring Experience Be it comfort, horsepower, or ease of riding, the Gold Wing ticks all the right boxes\n\nThe Bigger Brother\n\nBigger, Better, Faster, But Just As Short-Lived\n\nIt would be remiss of us to not mention the CX650 Turbo, the successor to the CX500 Turbo. As the name suggests, it had a larger displacement engine and a higher compression ratio to make performance a little better off boost. To keep things in check, it also got a smaller turbocharger compared to the CX650, which makes the transition from off boost to on boost smoother.\n\nThe CX650 might have been a midsize displacement for the time, but no motorcycle could match it for torque and in-gear acceleration once that turbocharger was on boost. Just like the CX500, the CX650 Turbo was yanked from showroom floors after just a year of being on sale. We wouldn't see forced induction on any production machine after this era until the Kawasaki Ninja H2 debuted three decades later. Even that doesn't get a turbo, though.\n\nEngine Type\n\nLiquid-cooled longitudinal v twin, turbocharged\n\nDisplacement\n\n647 cc\n\nMax Power\n\n100 HP @ 8,000 RPM\n\nMax Torque\n\n68.5 LB-FT @ 6,000 RPM\n\nTop Speed\n\n125 MPH", "source": {"uri": "topspeed.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Top Speed"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charles_pennefather@topspeed.com", "name": "Charles Pennefather", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citro\u00ebn_CX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Citro\u00ebn CX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motorcycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_injection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fuel injection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive_shaft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drive shaft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_CX_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Honda CX series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touring_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touring car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Gold_Wing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Honda Gold Wing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valvetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valvetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiator_(engine_cooling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radiator (engine cooling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pony_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pony car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-twin_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "V-twin engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_camshaft_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overhead camshaft engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_suspension", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Car suspension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Longitudinal engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle_fork", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motorcycle fork"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle_frame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motorcycle frame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawasaki_Heavy_Industries", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kawasaki Heavy Industries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yamaha Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley-Davidson", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harley-Davidson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suzuki"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Motorcycles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Motorcycles", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes_and_Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes and Models", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Maintenance", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Maintenance", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Performance_Tuning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Performance Tuning", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://static1.topspeedimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/honda-cx500t-studio-shot.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541540", "eventUri": "eng-9541540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

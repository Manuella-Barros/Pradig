Akmal said he was 'insulted' by the head coach and deprived of the opportunity to \"improve myself\". The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) instantly took note of his outburst, issuing a show-cause notice demanding he respond within a fortnight.\n\nAkmal was originally named in the national high performance camp organised at the National Cricket Academy (NCA), but pulled out citing a knee injury. According to him, he had informed the relevant officials - including head coach Mushtaq Ahmed - and excused himself for five weeks, during which he intended to undergo rehabilitation with his private trainer in England. Despite returning earlier than expected, the camp had already concluded. While Akmal wished to rejoin the daily training sessions at the NCA with the national coaches, the staff said they were presently working with contracted players to prepare them ahead of their domestic and international assignments.\n\n\"I had gone to England for rehabilitation of my knee injury,\" Akmal said. \"After I recovered, I went to the NCA to start working on my fitness and training. But the coaching staff doesn't want to work with me at all. When I asked why all those international coaches didn't want to work with me, they responded that they wanted to prioritise working with players who had central contracts. I said that I too am an international Pakistan cricketer, and if my fitness is lacking - and I admit that along the way my fitness has been found wanting - they should help me. I then went to talk to the chief selector (Inzamam), but he referred me to Arthur. Arthur took me back to Inzi bhai's room and started scolding me and using bad language in front of Inzi bhai, which I found demeaning and insulting. It's not even my fault, and I find it painful that anyone should be allowed to swear at me. I accept my fitness isn't up to the mark, and I am trying to work on it, and I asked to be allowed a trainer to help me. But Mickey said I shouldn't even have come to the NCA, and should be playing club cricket instead.\"\n\nAkmal said Arthur shouldn't be swearing at him like he was abusing all of Pakistan. \"You look at any cricket match, and you'll see he's swearing at one player or the other. I want to reveal this to the public and to all my fans. I request PCB chairman Najam Sethi to take this issue very seriously. When the head coach is allowed to swear at someone whenever they wish, that is unacceptable. As a Pakistani, I could not stomach it.\"\n\nArthur confirmed that he did exchange words with Akmal the other day, and informed him that as he was no more a contracted player, he needed to earn back the right to use the facility at the national level. \"I did tell Akmal a few home truths and said he was always looking for excuses instead of looking at himself,\" Arthur said. \"I also told him that he had to earn the right to use our support staff because he is not a contracted cricketer. He can't just walk in here and demand what he wants.\"\n\nArthur has, over the last year of his contract, made improving Pakistan's fitness standards a central focus of his coaching tenure. On various occasions, he has been candid, and at times censorious, when airing his views about the fitness of a number of Pakistan players, including Akmal. The PCB is understood to have thrown its support behind his fitness campaign, and given him free hand to axe players who did not meet his fitness standards. This latest controversy began when Akmal was sent back home from England after failing two fitness tests leading up to the Champions Trophy, despite initially being included in the squad. Akmal had previously been dropped from a tour of the West Indies in April for similar reasons. He was excluded from that squad after he was the only player, out of 31, to fail the fitness test during a camp held at the NCA in March.\n\nWith Arthur's position stronger than it has arguably been at any point in his stint as Pakistan coach in the wake of the side's Champions Trophy triumph, it is difficult to presently see how Akmal could come out on top in this exchange.\n\nHowever, with the flamboyant cricketer never far from the news, only a fool would believe this to be the last chapter in Akmal's cricketing tale.", "id": "9561293", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "  Micky Arthur verbally abused me, claims Umar Akmal", "image": "http://dailytimes.com.pk/static/uploads/original/f1fcdfd47bf8add7f25e74f35b5a1f6d.JPG ", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "178", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "48501", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore", "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "242110", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": null, "score": 1, "id": "303251", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cricket"}, "id": "305608", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket"}, {"label": {"eng": "Stomach"}, "id": "309238", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mushtaq Ahmed"}, "id": "309571", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushtaq_Ahmed"}, {"label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}, "id": "309573", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Inzamam-ul-Haq"}, "id": "379825", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inzamam-ul-Haq"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pakistan Cricket Board"}, "id": "415325", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Cricket_Board"}, {"label": {"eng": "Najam Sethi"}, "id": "415326", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najam_Sethi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Umar Akmal"}, "id": "430223", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umar_Akmal"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mickey Arthur"}, "id": "437978", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Arthur"}, {"label": {"eng": "Club cricket"}, "id": "534434", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_cricket"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 485, "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 865, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 866, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 867, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/News_and_Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1028, "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness"}], "time": "20:41:00"}

Akmal also said that senior players did not stop the coach when he was being verbally abused and added that the coach had told him to play club-level cricket instead of coming to the academy.\n\nAkmal further claimed that he was dropped from the team after an unjustified warning. He also said that he wants to inform the Pakistan Cricket Board regarding the behaviour of the coaching staff.\n\nHowever, Arthur refuted Akmal's claims and said Akmal was not telling the truth. Arthur added that he had asked Akmal to improve upon his skills and attitude. Coach Mickey Arthur rubbishes Umar Akmal's allegations\n\nAkmal was dropped from the Pakistan squad for the Champions Trophy in Birmingham in May this year after the batsman failed two consecutive fitness tests in two months.\n\nThe middle-order batsman's failure in fitness tests prompted selectors to bring in Haris Sohail in place of Akmal, asking the cricketer to return home to work on his fitness. Akmal had also been dropped from the team that toured the West Indies in April, after being the only player, among 31, to fail the fitness test during a camp held at the NCA in March.\n\nIn an annual assessment earlier this year, Akmal had weighed 91kg with a fat-level reading of 115.6. A measurement in excess of 100 is considered high. After being released from Pakistan's squad for the ICC Champions Trophy 2017, Akmal had apologised to his fans, saying he was determined to come back stronger than ever and promised to remain committed to cricket.\n\nEarlier in May, chief selector and former batsman Inzamamul Haq reported on Akmal s fitness. Umar Akmal could not maintain his fitness after Pakistan Cup, and that is why he was being sent back from England, he had said.\n\nDuring the press conference, Akmal also asserted that he was working on his fitness in England since then to make a comeback to the palying eleven.\n\nOn the other hand, Arthur has denied the allegations asserting that he did not misbehave with the player however, he admitted to having censured the cricketer for questionable discipline and poor fitness.\n\nSouth African cricketer Mickey Arthur is employed by the cricket board as the head coach of the team under whose command the national eleven led by skipper Sarfraz brought home Pakistan's maiden Champions Trophy earlier this year.", "id": "9574416", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Mickey Arthur verbally abused me, claims Umar - The Frontier Post", "image": "http://thefrontierpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Umar-Akmal-sports-page.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "178", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "48501", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore", "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "91699", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "242110", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cricket"}, "id": "305608", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket"}, {"label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}, "id": "309573", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}, "id": "309574", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)"}, {"label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "id": "339771", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team"}, {"label": {"eng": "Inzamam-ul-Haq"}, "id": "379825", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inzamam-ul-Haq"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pakistan Cricket Board"}, "id": "415325", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Cricket_Board"}, {"label": {"eng": "Umar Akmal"}, "id": "430223", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umar_Akmal"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mickey Arthur"}, "id": "437978", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Arthur"}, {"label": {"eng": "Haris Sohail"}, "id": "563948", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haris_Sohail"}, {"label": {"eng": "ICC Champions Trophy"}, "id": "797267", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Champions_Trophy"}, {"label": {"eng": "1998 Under-19 Cricket World Cup squads"}, "id": "1403750", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Under-19_Cricket_World_Cup_squads"}], "location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 865, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 866, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 867, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/News_and_Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 983, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fitness", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fitness"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1028, "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness"}], "time": "22:20:00"}

Akmal was also the only player to fail the fitness test from the 31 players who underwent the drills in Lahore in March.\n\nAkmal urged Najam Sethi, the PCB chairman, to take a note of Arthur's behaviour towards players. \"He [Arthur] shouldn't be swearing at me like that, it is like he's abusing all of Pakistan,\" Akmal said. \"You look at any cricket match, and you'll see he's swearing at one player or the other.

Why do academies exist? They exist to correct our mistakes.

I told him he must first earn the right to go and play club cricket since he is not under PCB contract anymore.\" Arthur said. \"He needs to prove himself before he uses our support staff.\n\n\"I never stopped him from using the academy; told him not to use services of our support staff until he earns the right.

The PCB has given Akmal seven days to file his reply.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TheRealPCB/status/898099229180268544\n\nAkmal, who had gone to the NCA for training after recovering from his knee injury, said Arthur took him to Inzamam-ul-Haq, the chief selector, where Mushtaq Ahmed, the NCA head coach, was also present and verbally abused him.\n\n\"After I recovered, I went to the NCA to start working on my fitness and training but the coaching staff doesn't want to work with me at all,\" Akmal told the reporters on Wednesday.\n\n\"I then went to talk to Inzi bhai, but he referred me to Mickey Arthur. Arthur took me back to Inzi bhai's room and started scolding me and using bad language in front of Inzi bhai, which I found demeaning and insulting. It's not even my fault, and I find it painful that anyone should be allowed to swear at me. I accept my fitness isn't up to the mark, and I am trying to work on it, and I asked to be allowed a trainer to help me. But Mickey said I shouldn't even have come to the NCA, and should be playing club cricket instead.\"\n\nAkmal had also urged Najam Sethi, the PCB chairman, to take a note of Arthur's behaviour. \"He [Arthur] shouldn't be swearing at me like that, it is like he's abusing all of Pakistan,\" rued Akmal. \"You look at any cricket match, and you'll see he's swearing at one player or the other. I want to reveal this to the public and to all my fans. I request the chairman to take this issue very seriously. When the head coach is allowed to swear at someone whenever they wish, that is unacceptable. As a Pakistani, I could not stomach it.\"\n\nArthur, however, rubbished Akmal's claims saying that he didn't stop the 27-year-old from using NCA facilities but only barred him from using the services of the coaching staff as he isn't centrally contracted player. \"Umar Akmal wanted to use Grant Flower's (Pakistan's batting coach) services,\" Arthur was quoted as saying by Geo TV.\n\n\"I told him he must first earn the right to go and play club cricket since he is not under PCB contract anymore. I never stopped him from using the academy. Umar Akmal cannot expect that the support staff, who are for contracted players, are at his beck and call. No body there should be taken for granted.

Akmal alleged that Arthur used abusive language against him and barred him from using the National Cricket Academy, saying he had to 'earn that right'.\n\nAkmal told reporters that he was 'insulted' by the head coach and deprived of the opportunity to \"improve myself\". The PCB instantly took note of his outburst, issuing a show-cause notice demanding he respond within a fortnight.\n\nAkmal was originally named in the national high performance camp organised by the NCA, but pulled out citing a knee injury. According to him, he had informed the relevant officials - including head coach Mushtaq Ahmed - and excused himself for five weeks, during which he intended to undergo rehabilitation with his private trainer in England. Despite returning earlier than expected, the camp had already concluded.\n\nWhile Akmal wished to rejoin the daily training sessions at the NCA with the national coaches, the staff said they were presently working with contracted players to prepare them ahead of their domestic and international assignments.\n\n\"I had gone to England for rehabilitation of my knee injury,\" Akmal said. \"After I recovered, I went to the NCA to start working on my fitness and training. But the coaching staff doesn't want to work with me at all. When I asked why all those international coaches didn't want to work with me, they responded that they wanted to prioritise working with players who had central contracts. I said that I too am an international Pakistan cricketer, and if my fitness is lacking - and I admit that along the way my fitness has been found wanting - they should help me.\n\n\"I then went to talk to the chief selector (Inzamam), but he referred me to Mickey Arthur. Arthur took me back to Inzi bhai's room and started scolding me and using bad language in front of Inzi bhai, which I found demeaning and insulting.\n\n\"It's not even my fault, and I find it painful that anyone should be allowed to swear at me. I accept my fitness isn't up to the mark, and I am trying to work on it, and I asked to be allowed a trainer to help me. But Mickey said I shouldn't even have come to the NCA, and should be playing club cricket instead.\"\n\nArthur confirmed to ESPNcricinfo that he did exchange words with Akmal the other day, and informed him that as he was no more a contracted player, he needed to earn back the right to use the facility at the national level.\n\n\"I did tell him [Akmal] a few home truths and said he was always looking for excuses instead of looking at himself,\" Arthur said. \"I also told him that he had to earn the right to use our support staff because he is not a contracted cricketer. He can't just walk in here and demand what he wants.\"\n\nArthur has, over the last year of his contract, made improving Pakistan's fitness standards a central focus of his coaching tenure. On various occasions, he has been candid, and at times censorious, when airing his views about the fitness of a number of Pakistan players, including Akmal. The PCB is understood to have thrown its support behind his fitness campaign, and given him free hand to axe players who did not meet his fitness standards.\n\nThis latest controversy began when Akmal was sent back home from England after failing two fitness tests leading up to the Champions Trophy, despite initially being included in the squad. Akmal had previously been dropped from a tour of the West Indies in April for similar reasons. He was excluded from that squad after he was the only player, out of 31, to fail the fitness test during a camp held at the NCA in March.\n\n\"He [Arthur] shouldn't be swearing at me like that, it is like he's abusing all of Pakistan,\" Akmal said. \"You look at any cricket match, and you'll see he's swearing at one player or the other. I want to reveal this to the public and to all my fans. I request the chairman [Najam Sethi] to take this issue very seriously. When the head coach is allowed to swear at someone whenever they wish, that is unacceptable. As a Pakistani, I could not stomach it.\n\n\"I want to tell them that even when I try to do something good, I am prevented from doing so. When I take pictures with my fans, they, too, tell me to work on my fitness, and I feel they are right. But now I want to rectify this, everything is being snatched away from me. Why do academies exist? They exist to correct our mistakes. Now you should tell me what to do; I am a Pakistan player.\"\n\nThe coaching staff, however, has a different perspective about Akmal. He was recently offered yet another chance after being named in the high performance camp before the central contracts were announced. But he opted to skip it, claiming he had a knee injury since the Australia tour. \"I didn't tell the NCA about the injury because I was on tour when it occurred. I told the team doctor, who said straightaway it would need an operation. I believed all I needed was rehab, and asked him to advise me about exercises that I could do, and said I'd be willing to do them.\n\n\"I then spent my own money to go to England and deal with my injury. I told everyone (at the camp before leaving for England). I emailed Dr Suhail and told Mushtaq Ahmed (the NCA head coach). I have proof of this. I had a knee injury, and I simply went for rehabilitation. I told them I would be ready to do whatever they wanted me to do.\"\n\nWith Arthur's position stronger than it has arguably been at any point in his stint as Pakistan coach in the wake of the side's Champions Trophy triumph, it is difficult to presently see how Akmal could come out on top in this exchange. However, with the flamboyant cricketer never far from the news, only a fool would believe this to be the last chapter in Akmal's cricketing tale.", "id": "9534922", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Umar Akmal furious at Arthur snub", "image": "http://www.espncricinfo.com/db/PICTURES/CMS/257900/257950.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "12", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "178", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "48501", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore", "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "242110", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "303251", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cricket"}, "id": "305608", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket"}, {"label": {"eng": "Stomach"}, "id": "309238", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mushtaq Ahmed"}, "id": "309571", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushtaq_Ahmed"}, {"label": {"eng": "ESPNcricinfo"}, "id": "325538", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPNcricinfo"}, {"label": {"eng": "Inzamam-ul-Haq"}, "id": "379825", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inzamam-ul-Haq"}, {"label": {"eng": "Umar Akmal"}, "id": "430223", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umar_Akmal"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mickey Arthur"}, "id": "437978", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Arthur"}, {"label": {"eng": "Club cricket"}, "id": "534434", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_cricket"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Cricket Academy"}, "id": "557309", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cricket_Academy"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 485, "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 865, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 866, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 867, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/News_and_Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 983, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fitness", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fitness"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1028, "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness"}], "time": "17:41:00"}

After this, I went to the head coach.\"\n\nAccording to Akmal, the head coach did not seem to be in a good mood and took him to Chief Selector Inzamam-ul-Haq where NCA head coach Mushtaq Ahmed was also present.\n\n\"There he [Arthur] used abusive words for me in the presence of both Inzamam and Mushtaq which is really painful and highly embarrassing for me as a cricketer who has played for the national team,\" Akmal said at the presser.\n\nAkmal added, \"Arthur also admonished me, asking who allowed me to enter the NCA. He told me that it was better that I play club cricket instead of practising at the NCA.\n\n\"As a national cricketer, it is my right to use the NCA to improve my form and fitness,\" he asserted.\n\nAkmal, who has played 16 Tests, 116 ODIs and 82 T20 Internationals for Pakistan, emphasised.\n\nAkmal -- who on various occasions in the past has made headlines for his antics off the field -- claimed that he was not penalised during his career on a single occasion for any on-field breach of discipline, adding, \"I never misbehaved with any coach in the past.\"\n\nAkmal maintained that although he had not received an appropriate response from Arthur on the occasion of the ICC Champions Trophy held in June this year, the treatment meted out to him on Tuesday at the NCA was even more heart-breaking.\n\nWhile the Inzamam-led selection committee had picked Akmal for the Champions Trophy, Arthur sent him back after the batsman failed a fitness Test in England.\n\nEarlier, Akmal, according to the PCB, had passed the fitness test held at the NCA. However, Arthur sent him back and replaced him with Haris Sohail for the elite eight-nation event.\n\nAccording to Akmal, he fell to the ground during a fitness test in England, but the trainer suggested an operation on his knee injury without conducting any tests.\n\n\"But I got my knee fixed when a football physio worked on it.

Akmal said that he was dropped from the team for the Champions Trophy after unjustified warning and wasn't allowed to take the fitness test.\n\nIssuing a statement on Friday, the PCB said, \"While making frivolous allegations against the national team management, Umar has made a bogus attempt to deviate attention from his own failings. Umar was given as many as seven chances to improve his fitness and match the standards of his teammates, laid out by the team management.''\n\n''Umar was given a program to improve his fitness like other players before the West Indies tour and after he failed the tests in Lahore, he was left out of the team. After clearing another test before the squad selection on eve of the ICC Champions Trophy in England, Umar was included in the eventual 15-member squad.''\n\nThe board further stated that Arthur had placed Akmal in his white ball format plans and gave him repeated chances for redemption.\n\n''Unfortunately the batsman remained incapable of reaching the requisite fitness level,'' the statement said.\n\nThe statement further read that the PCB awaits Akmal's response to the show cause issued to him and hopes that in the meantime, the \"batsman will refrain from making baseless allegations.''\n\nAccording to The Express Tribune, the middle-order batsman further claimed that Arthur verbally abused him in front of chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq. Akmal also claimed that other players were victims of regular abuse from the national coach.\n\nThe 27-year-old cricketer said, \"Mickey Arthur abused me and used inappropriate words for me.\"\n\nAdding, Akmal said, \"He has debarred me from the academy and told me to play club cricket. No player stepped in to ask him not to use such language for a Pakistan international. It's not befitting of Arthur to abuse Pakistani players.\"\n\nHowever, Arthur had brushed aside all allegations levelled against him by Akmal by saying, \"He wanted to use Grant Flower's services for batting. I told him he must earn the right to use the support staff and should first play club cricket.

Mickey Arthur used first poor language and then abused me. Inzamam bhai and Mushtaq bhai (Ahmed) are both witness to this incident at the NCA,\" Akmal told PTI on Wednesday.

I went to them and spoke to them. They explained things to me about my status and reminded me I had failed the fitness test several times. They advised me to listen to what was being said to me.

And then he used poor and abusive language.

The right-handed batsman said that former captain Inzamam-ul Haq and former leg spinner Mushtaq Ahmed were both witness to the incident. Meanwhile, according to a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) spokesperson, a show-cause notice is set to be issued to Akmal for breaching the terms of contract and clauses for players by speaking to the media on the issue.\n\nThe incident between Akmal and Arthur is said to have taken place when the former reached the academy for training. The batsman had returned from England following a rehabilitation programme for a knee problem.\n\nIn July, Akmal was omitted from PCB's list of players that received national contracts.\n\n\"I stand by what I told the media earlier today. Mickey Arthur used first poor language and then abused me. Inzamam bhai and Mushtaq bhai (Ahmed) are both witness to this incident at the NCA,\" Akmal told PTI on Wednesday.\n\nAkmal said that while he had informed batting coach Grant Flower for his need to practice at the academy, he was turned away because he was not a centrally contracted played any more.\n\n\"When I reached there first Grant and then our physio, Grant Luden refused to accommodate me saying they were only working with the centrally contracted players. I then went to Mickey and he told he was instructed only to work with the contracted players,\" said the right-hander.\n\n\"He then told me go and speak to Inzamam and Mushtaq. I went to them and spoke to them. They explained things to me about my status and reminded me I had failed the fitness test several times. They advised me to listen to what was being said to me. I said okay and then they told me go and talk to Mickey again,\" Akmal recalled.\n\n\"First he told me what I was doing at the academy. He then told me I should go and play club cricket. And then he used poor and abusive language. I can tolerate anything but I don't think anyone has the right to use such language,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, a PCB spokesman told PTI that a show-cause notice would be issued to Akmal for not taking the board's permission before speaking to the media.\n\n\"He is not a centrally contracted player but he is still bound by clauses governing players even one year after his contract expires. He can't speak to the media without first seeking permission from the board,\" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, Akmal has said that he went to the media only because of the 'bad language' used by Arthur and hoped that the PCB would look into the matter.\n\n\"I want to know that after I was dropped for the West Indies tour did I complain or blame anyone? I admitted I needed to work harder on my fitness and game.\n\n\"When I was sent back from the Champions Trophy which was a humiliating experience for me I didn't say anything or speak in the media. I only admitted I needed to improve my fitness and I had to do better.\n\n\"I went to England for rehabilitation and remained positive. But today I went to the media because the head coach used bad language and he has no right to do this with any player and I want the PCB to look into this.\"\n\nAkmal has played has played in 16 Tests, 116 ODIs and 82 T20Is for Pakistan.\n\n(With PTI Inputs)", "id": "9633792", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Pakistan Cricketer Umar Akmal Makes Shocking Revelation: 'Coach Mickey Arthur Abused Me' - NDTV Sports", "image": "https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2017-08/umar-akmal-training-afp_806x605_61502952852.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "178", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "48501", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore", "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "242110", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "303251", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cricket"}, "id": "305608", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mushtaq Ahmed"}, "id": "309571", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushtaq_Ahmed"}, {"label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}, "id": "309573", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf"}, "id": "335568", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf"}, {"label": {"eng": "Polychlorinated biphenyl"}, "id": "336013", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polychlorinated_biphenyl"}, {"label": {"eng": "Leg spin"}, "id": "378670", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_spin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Inzamam-ul-Haq"}, "id": "379825", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inzamam-ul-Haq"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pakistan Cricket Board"}, "id": "415325", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Cricket_Board"}, {"label": {"eng": "Umar Akmal"}, "id": "430223", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umar_Akmal"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mickey Arthur"}, "id": "437978", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Arthur"}, {"label": {"eng": "Club cricket"}, "id": "534434", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_cricket"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Cricket Academy"}, "id": "557309", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cricket_Academy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Grant Flower"}, "id": "560724", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Flower"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 373, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Linguistics", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Linguistics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 865, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 866, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 867, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/News_and_Media"}], "time": "07:01:00"}

Inzamam bhai and Mushtaq bhai (Ahmed) are both witnesses to this incident at the NCA,\" Umar told while talking to PTI.\n\n\"When I reached there, first Grant and then our physio, Grant Luden refused to accommodate me saying they were only working with the centrally contracted players. I then went to Mickey and he told he was instructed only to work with the contracted players,\" Umar said.\n\nExplaining the conversation he had with Inzaman-ul-Haq and Mushtaq Ahmed, he said, \"He then told me to go and speak to Inzamam and Mushtaq. I went to them and spoke to them. They explained things to me about my status and reminded me I had failed the fitness test several times. They advised me to listen to what was being said to me. I said okay and then they told me to go and talk to Mickey again.\" and added, \"First he told me what I was doing at the Academy. He then told me I should go and play club cricket. And then he used poor and abusive language. I can tolerate anything but I don't think anyone has the right to use such language.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a PCB official spoke to PTI and said that Umar Akmal can't talk to media despite not being a centrally contracted player.\n\n\"He is not a centrally contracted player but he is still bound by clauses governing players even one year after his contract expires. He can't speak to the media without first seeking permission from the board,\" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, Akmal sustained on what he had said and demanded an intervention by the Pakistan Cricket Board.\n\n\"I want to know that after I was dropped for the West Indies tour did I complain or blame anyone? I admitted I needed to work harder on my fitness and game. \"When I was sent back from the Champions Trophy which was a humiliating experience for me I didn't say anything or speak in the media. I only admitted I needed to improve my fitness and I had to do better. I went to England for rehabilitation and remained positive. But today I went to the media because the head coach used bad language and he has no right to do this with any player and I want the PCB to look into this,\" he said.\n\nFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App", "id": "9649889", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Mickey Arthur abused me and used poor language, says Umar Akmal", "image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/08/umar.jpg?w=480", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 33, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 48}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "178", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Game of Thrones"}, "id": "307060", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mushtaq Ahmed"}, "id": "309571", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushtaq_Ahmed"}, {"label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}, "id": "309573", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Umar"}, "id": "332710", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umar"}, {"label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "id": "339771", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manish Malhotra"}, "id": "350790", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Malhotra"}, {"label": {"eng": "Inzamam-ul-Haq"}, "id": "379825", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inzamam-ul-Haq"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pakistan Cricket Board"}, "id": "415325", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Cricket_Board"}, {"label": {"eng": "Umar Akmal"}, "id": "430223", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umar_Akmal"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mickey Arthur"}, "id": "437978", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Arthur"}, {"label": {"eng": "Club cricket"}, "id": "534434", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_cricket"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Cricket Academy"}, "id": "557309", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cricket_Academy"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 373, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Linguistics", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Linguistics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 865, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 866, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 867, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/News_and_Media"}], "time": "09:14:00"}

He told me that it was better for me to play club cricket instead of doing practice at the NCA.\n\n\"As a national cricketer, it is my right to use the NCA to improve my form and fitness,\" Umar, who has played 16 Tests, 116 ODIs and 82 T20 Internationals for Pakistan, emphasised.\n\nGiving the background of his conversation with Arthur, Umar said, \"First, I met the trainer and other members of the foreign staff of national team management, who refused to work with me, saying they will only work with [PCB's] centrally-contracted players. After this, I went to the head coach.\"\n\nUmar -- who on various occasions in the past made headlines for his off-the-field antics blurring his name besides bringing a bad name to Pakistan cricket -- claimed that he was not penalised during his career even on a single occasion for any on-the-field breach of discipline, adding \"I never misbehaved with any coach in the past.\"\n\nUmar maintained that he did not receive appropriate response from Arthur on the occasion of the ICC Champions Trophy, held in June this year, but the treatment meted out to him on Tuesday at the NCA was even more heart-breaking for him.\n\nIt may be mentioned that though Inzamam-led selection committee had picked Umar for the Champions Trophy, Arthur sent him back after the batsman failed a fitness Test in England. Earlier, Umar, according to the PCB, had passed the fitness test held at the NCA. However, Arthur sent him back and replaced him with Haris Sohail for the elite eight-nation event.\n\nAccording to Umar, during the fitness test in England he fell at the ground but the trainer without conducting any test suggested an operation on his knee injury. \"But I got my knee fixed when a football physio worked on it. I myself paid all the expenses of my medical treatment in England,\" added the batsman.", "id": "9603253", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Umar Akmal back in the spotlight, hurls allegations at Mickey Arthur", "image": "http://i.dawn.com/medium/2017/08/599509271ab74.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "178", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "48501", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore", "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "242110", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "One Day International"}, "id": "302607", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cricket"}, "id": "305608", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket"}, {"label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}, "id": "309560", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mushtaq Ahmed"}, "id": "309571", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushtaq_Ahmed"}, {"label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}, "id": "309573", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Umar"}, "id": "332710", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umar"}, {"label": {"eng": "Inzamam-ul-Haq"}, "id": "379825", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inzamam-ul-Haq"}, {"label": {"eng": "Umar Akmal"}, "id": "430223", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umar_Akmal"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mickey Arthur"}, "id": "437978", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Arthur"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bangladesh national cricket team"}, "id": "440049", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_national_cricket_team"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}, "id": "456263", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Cricket Academy"}, "id": "557309", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cricket_Academy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Haris Sohail"}, "id": "563948", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haris_Sohail"}, {"label": {"eng": "ICC Champions Trophy"}, "id": "797267", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Champions_Trophy"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 485, "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 487, "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 865, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 866, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 867, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/News_and_Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1028, "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness"}], "time": "03:21:00"}

One thing is crystal clear here that Inzamam was not a part of this conspiracy since he selected me [in the squad].\"\n\nHe continued: \"I passed the fitness test at National Cricket Academy and was selected for the Champions Trophy. However, Arthur took a dummy test of the team when I reached England and declared me unfit so that he could send me back. This ascertained the fact that I was being conspired against.\"\n\nHe then posed a question for Arthur. \"The team just came back from the West Indies tour; didn't Arthur know who was fit and who was not then?\"\n\nUmar Akmal set to receive show cause notice over Arthur allegations\n\nHe answered the question himself, bringing in an alibi to support his argument. \"The dummy fitness test was taken just to send me back.

Umar was given as many as seven chances to improve his fitness and match the standards of his teammates, laid out by the team management.\"\n\nThe press release clarified the reason for Umar's omission from the Champions Trophy squad. \"Umar was given a program to improve his fitness like other players before the West Indies tour and after he failed the tests in Lahore, he was left out of the team,\" it said. \"After clearing another test before the squad selection on the eve of the ICC Champions Trophy in England, Umar was included in the eventual 15-member squad.\"\n\nUmar looking for change of fortune with new department UBL\n\nThe board further said that the fitness tests were a part of the board's policy. \"The PCB wants to stress that the team trainer conducts fitness tests of squad members before each international assignment and the tests before the Champions Trophy were conducted as a continuation of the policy.\"\n\nPCB also dismissed accusations that Arthur has anything against the middle-order batsman. \"Head coach Mickey Arthur had placed Umar in his white-ball format plans and gave him repeated chances for redemption, unfortunately though the batsman remained incapable of reaching the requisite fitness level.\"\n\nUmar vows to return, stronger than ever\n\nThe board then warned Umar from making baseless allegations and reminded him of preparing a response to their show-cause notice. \"The PCB awaits his response to the show-cause issued to him Thursday and hopes that in the meantime, the batsman will refrain from making baseless allegations.\"", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "wgt": 100, "id": 546, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing"}, {"uri":

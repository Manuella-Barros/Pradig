For those looking to cut back on costs at the grocery store, here are some tips that can help before and during a shopping trip.Meal PlanningSaving money on groceries begins before you leave home, by planning what food you\u2019ll be eating over the next few weeks, according to savings expert Anne Arbour, director of partnerships and education at the Credit Counselling Society. Ms. Arbour said the meal plan does not need to be rigid, but meal planning helps consumers create a shopping list they can stick to in the store.FlyersBoth paper and digital flyers alert shoppers to special promotions and discounts at local grocery stores, which can be a cost saver, Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISEDC) advised. Customers can review flyers to plan out where they want to shop, and what deals they can expect.

It\u2019s best to check with your local grocery stores to see if they offer this promotion.CouponsAnother great way to save at the checkout is to use coupons, Ms. Arbour said. \u201cThe worst thing they can say is no; it was a two-minute phone call, but they might send you a coupon for a free product,\u201c she said. \u201dIt\u2019s a pretty good return on your investment of time.\u201dPrice Tracking AppsThese apps track the prices of products at various retailers, alerting customers where to get the best deal, ISEDC said. They use location-specific information to help shoppers find the best price at local shops. Canadians can use the apps to plan out their shopping trips before they leave home by checking to see where the products they need to buy are at the lowest price. \u201cThis can help you spend less overall and save you from running from store to store to discover the best prices, which can result in saving your time,\u201d ISEDC said.Loyalty ProgramsMany retailers offer a loyalty program for shoppers, where you can collect points while spending money at the store. Those points can be redeemed for future purchases, so consumers can get some money off their sales bill. Check out the programs at your local grocery stores, but beware of the fine print, the government said. \u201cCheck the terms and conditions of these programs for \u2018use them or lose them\u2019 clauses on points,\u201d ISEDC said. \u201cYour points might lose their value over time if the company changes their redemption policy.\u201dSaving StackingSometimes customers can even stack all the deals together, Ms. Arbour said. With popular apps like Flipp, \u201cyou can see what\u2019s on sale, but they'll also point out and highlight where there are coupons available,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if you can get something on sale, plus you have a coupon on your phone or on paper ... and then potentially use a loyalty card or something like that to get some benefit from it, you can stack up all those benefits.\u201dFood Waste-Saver appsAnother way to cut costs at the grocery store is through waste-saving apps. These digital tools help stores advertise discounts on foods nearing expiration dates. Shoppers can save up to 50 percent on the cost of the item, the grocery store prevents unnecessary food waste, and everyone wins.Stay FocusedMs. Arbour cautioned shoppers to stick to items they know they will use and not get distracted by special offers or discounts.", "summary": "The cost of groceries continues to rise, according to Statistics Canada, causing Canadians to search for new ways to save.

{"id": 231234892, "title": "The hills are alive with the sound of Scotland!", "text": "Nestled in the southern German-Austrian border is the alpine town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Scotland\u2019s home-from-home for Euro 2024. Having spent the morning exploring the team basecamp, what a place Steve Clarke and his players have on their hands. With the highest peak in Germany, the Zugspitze, and of course the now infamous Mount Wank as a backdrop, there can be no complaints about the facilities for Scotland. Everywhere you turn you are greeted by stunning mountain views and rustic Bavarian town houses. As we explored the streets of Garmisch-Partenkirchen to get our bearings, the locals were a very friendly bunch. The hospitable and kind-natured aspect of this small town was summed up when we met the mayor Elizabeth Koch for an interview. Embraced by a warm hug and with a Scotland scarf draped around her shoulders \u2013 we knew we were in a town that knows it\u2019s playing it\u2019s part in a huge sporting occasion. \u201cI was secretly hoping Scotland would come here\u201d she says, as well as telling us about her love of all things whiskey and Rod Stewart. \u201cWe are so excited to welcome Steve Clarke and his Scotland players. This has been a long time coming for our little town but we cannot wait for the UEFA Euros to get started\u201d, she said. \u201cWe know the Scottish people like to have fun and maybe some bear so we are delighted to welcome everyone to Garmisch-Partenkirchen\u201d. This town has been preparing for this tournament for a few years now and have put in a lot of money to improve the infrastructure and facilitates for Scotland\u2019s arrival. Mrs Koch also pointed us in the direction of a local butcher who has created a sausage just to commemorate Scotland\u2019s stay in the town, of course flavoured with whiskey. This Euros campaign has been massive in terms of the build-up back in Scotland but walking around this picturesque little town you get the sense they are ready to also play their part. Euro 2024 branding in shop windows, street lamps and of course at the Scotland basecamp, not to mention a right good few saltires across the town to welcome their new tenants for the next few weeks. After all the build up it feels real now. Scotland are on the big stage again. A major tournament is bracing it\u2019s self for the arrival of Scotland and yes, especially where in the German-Austrian border, the hills are alive with the sound of Scotland!", "summary": "Ronnie Charters reports from the town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen - Scotland's home-from-home for Euro 2024.", "url": "https://news.stv.tv/sport/the-hills-are-alive-with-the-sound-of-scotland", "image": "https://news.stv.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/3b3064441ab2ca70b34667804024bbab-1717849209.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:31:53", "author": "Holly Lennon,Ronnie Charters", "authors": ["Holly Lennon", "Ronnie Charters"], "language": "en", "source_country": "tv", "sentiment": 0.395}

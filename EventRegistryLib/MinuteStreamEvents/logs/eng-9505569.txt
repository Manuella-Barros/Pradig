Her surviving son suffered broken legs, broken ribs and a fractured skull.\n\nRaquel Smouthers told the court that she was at the party and witnessed the deaths of her nephew and niece.\n\n\"They were sitting at that table eating, and this woman crashed her car through this building destroying all of our lives,\" a nearly inconsolable Smouthers said. \"Nobody should ever have to go to a birthday party thinking that they're gonna die.\"\n\nThe boat club located off Swan Creek near Lake Erie is a membership-based organization that hosts holiday parties and other events, and provides docking space for members who own boats, according to its website.

She made the choice to get in that car and she chose to drink and drive and she took those babies from us,\" grandmother Kathy Phillips said.\n\nBill Colovos, Chidester's attorney, said his client has no record and is retired, living a \"peaceful life.\"\n\n\"In 60 years on this earth, she's never had any traffic involvement, she's never had any law enforcement involvement,\" Colovos said. \"It's horrible what happened, absolutely horrible ..., but some things we don't have control over.\"\n\nHe said Chidester drives \"like a little old lady\" and has a history since November of having epileptic-type seizures in her legs that result in paralysis. She was treated for it that day, he said.\n\nSomeone on the Zoom feed interjected as the attorney was speaking and said, \"She shouldn't have been drinking.\"\n\nMonroe County Prosecutor Jeffrey Yorkey said there was no evidence Chidester had a seizure the day of the crash.\n\nHe said a \"very long investigation,\" including a breath test, indicated she was significantly over the legal limit. He did not say what her blood alcohol content was, but said she admitted to drinking.\n\nColovos told reporters after the arraignment that a search warrant of Verna's Tavern, where police said Chidester had been drinking, found that Chidester only had one glass of wine and a bowl of chili for lunch from 11 a.m. to noon Saturday. He said police were too quick to blame the bar and name them to the media when they \"didn't do anything wrong.\"\n\nHe said they do not have the results back from the blood alcohol test yet, and the preliminary breath test Chidester took on the scene is not admissible in court because it's often inaccurate.\n\nColovos said Chidester had a seizure at the wheel and said she does not remember entering the parking lot of the boat club, nor anything that happened leading up to the crash. He said she was invited to the birthday party by the person hosting it. She has been treated for seizures since November, Colovos said, and has not had any seizures since she was put on medication in November.\n\nRaquel Smouthers, Lana and Zayn's aunt, said even if Chidester was on medication or had medical issues, she should not have been driving. She said her niece Lana had flawless curly hair and loved to dance. Her nephew Zayn loved cracking jokes and held Eminem as his idol.\n\n\"Nobody should ever have to go to a birthday party thinking they're going to die,\" Smothers said. \"They walked into that birthday party having a fun time. They were sitting at that table, eating. And this woman crashed her car through this building, destroying all of our lives.\"\n\nYorkey requested that Monroe District Court Judge Christian Horkey set Chidester's bond at $1.5 million, noting that friends and family told investigators she has a \"very severe substance abuse issue.\"\n\nLana and Zayn's older brother and mother were in critical condition after the crash, according to a GoFundMe set up by the children's aunt, Diane Harrington. Their mother, Mariah Dodds, filed a lawsuit Monday against Chidester and the bar police said she was drinking at before the crash.\n\nChidester crashed into the Swan Boat Club in the 6000 block of Brancheau in Berlin Township at about 3 p.m. Saturday, according to the Monroe County Sheriff's Office. Her car landed 25 feet into the building, Monroe County Sheriff Troy Goodnough said.\n\n\"The scene was described by first responders as extremely chaotic, with high levels of emotions of those directly involved and those who witnessed this horrific incident,\" Goodnough said at a press conference Saturday night.\n\nThe boat club was closed Sunday, according to its website and Facebook page. \"Our deepest sympathy goes out to this family and everyone else that was involved,\" said the boat club's post. \"That family has asked us to post their go fund me to help with the funeral arrangements for the two children.\"\n\n-------\n\n\u00a92024 www.detroitnews.com.

Justice After Deadly Crash at Michigan Boating Club", "body": "Marshella Chidester, a 66-year-old woman, appeared in court on Tuesday with a cast on her right arm.\n\nChidester has been accused of second-degree murder for allegedly driving her SUV into the wall of the Swan Creek Boat Club, where a child's birthday party was being held on Saturday.\n\nThe incident resulted in the deaths of two children, Lana, 8, and Zayn, 5, while their mother, Mariah Dodds, and elder brother, Jayden, are fighting for their lives.\n\nWhen Chidester entered the courtroom, the livestream showed her with a cast on her right arm, suggesting she suffered an injury during the incident.\n\nThe suspect has been detained since the crash, and the judge granted her a $1.5 million bond, as requested by the prosecution.\n\nProsecutor Jeff Yorkey informed the court that Chidester had a history of substance misuse, which her friends and family had confirmed, in support of the $1.5 million bond.\n\nBill Colovos, the defense lawyer, requested that the judge set Chidester's bond at $100,000, claiming that she has suffered from 'epileptic-type seizures' in her legs since November.\n\nColovos also claimed that Chidester had only consumed a bowl of chili and a glass of wine four hours prior to the collision, and argued that \"this is not a monster.\"\n\nYorkey, however, argued that Chidester showed no signs of having a seizure before the crash and that her blood alcohol level was \"significantly over the legal limit.\"\n\nIf the accused pays her bond, she will be forced to give up her passport, alcohol, wear a tether, and not drive.\n\nChidester, who was the former commodore of the boat club, is scheduled to appear in a probable cause conference on April 30 and a preliminary examination on May 6.\n\nThe children's aunt, Raquel Smouthers, testified in court, saying she was at the party when Chidester killed her niece and nephew, and that \"nobody should ever have to go to a birthday party thinking that they're gonna die.\"\n\nDodds is suing Chidester and the tavern she allegedly drank at before getting back into her car, sustaining broken ribs, a collapsed lung, and cuts and bruises, while her son broke his legs, some of his ribs, and fractured his skull.\n\nA GoFundMe has been set up to help cover funeral expenses for the children, and horrific images captured the aftermath of the incident, with scattered balloons and party cups lying amongst the rubble.\n\nAt a press conference, Monroe County Sheriff Troy Goodnough explained that when the woman slammed her vehicle into the building, she travelled a further 25 feet inside because of her speed, and that it was \"extremely chaotic\" with a \"high level of emotions\" at the scene.\n\nOne child was reportedly pinned under the vehicle as it flew through the building, while the brother and sister who lost their lives were tragically pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nHelicopters and ambulances took nine victims to nearby hospitals, who were listed as being in life-threatening condition, and further victims were also taken to hospital in cars.", "source": {"uri": "dcweekly.org", "dataType":

The club also advertises on social media that members can rent the clubhouse or pavilion for personal events including birthday parties.\n\nMore from this section\n\nCalifornia IVF Fertility Center Awarded on Newsweek's America's Best Fertility Clinics 2024 List EnergyCAP earns 2024 Environment+Energy Leader Top Product Award Trump tried to 'corrupt' the 2016 election, prosecutor alleges as hush money trial gets underway", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kulr8.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_township", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil township"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Detroit_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Detroit News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_County,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monroe County, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monroe County, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Erie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lake Erie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Wooden_Boats", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Wooden Boats", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Watercraft", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kulr8.com/content/tncms/custom/image/ebec0578-57d0-11ee-978f-b7da313020af.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505569", "eventUri": "eng-9505569", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4666666666666667, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

So did her 11-year-old son. Both are hospitalized.\n\nDodds and her surviving son's family relationship is now \"destroyed,\" as they witnessed the crash that killed their loved ones, the lawsuit states.\n\nThe Free Press could not reach an attorney for Chidester or anyone on her behalf. No one was at her home Monday morning when a reporter visited. She lives on Brancheau Street in Newport, which is less than 200 yards from the boat club. She lives there with her husband, according to property records.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by Dodds and her son, identified in the lawsuit as \"J.P.,\" accuses Chidester of gross negligence. Chidester is alleged to have driven into the north wall of the boat club fast enough to go about 25 feet inside the building until her vehicle stopped. A witness previously told the Free Press he thought he could see children lining up for cake inside.\n\nThe witness described a loud crash that could be heard numerous houses down the gravel road, and the screams of children and adults that followed.\n\nDodds' attorney, Michael Jones, could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nChidester was taken into custody after the crash on suspicion of operating a vehicle while intoxicated causing death, officials said. On Tuesday morning, Chidester was charged with eight counts, including two counts of second-degree homicide. Monroe County Prosecutor Jeffery Yorkey said he expected Chidester would be arraigned on the charges Tuesday morning.\n\nChidester had been an officer of the boat club, acting as a commodore for the group. Her mother was a charter member of the club, according to the mother's 2006 obituary.\n\nChidester worked at DTE as a manager at Fermi 2, as a strategic buyer, according to her LinkedIn page and the Monroe News.\n\nShe graduated from Newport's Jefferson High School in 1975, later attending Siena Heights University and getting a master's of business administration degree from Davenport University, Dearborn, according to an archived story in the Monroe News.\n\nMore: Child, woman in critical condition in aftermath of Monroe County boat club crash\n\nMore: Driver in suspected DUI crash that killed 2 children may have left Monroe County tavern earlier\n\nThe lawsuit also argues that Verna's Tavern is also liable. The bar allegedly sold Chidester alcohol while visibly intoxicated, according to the lawsuit, and continued drinking until she left the bar and ultimately crashed into the Swam Boat Club at 3 p.m. Saturday.\n\nVerna's Tavern should have stopped selling Chidester alcohol and should have provided alternate transportation to her home, the lawsuit argues.\n\nSheriff's deputies briefly closed Verna's Tavern after the crash as part of the crash investigation.\n\nThe tavern's attorney, John McManus, of Royal Oak, could not immediately be reached for comment.In an email to the Free Press, Angie Huffman, who said that her mother owns Verna's, confirmed the suspect was there at 11 a.m., had a glass of wine and a bowl of soup, adding that she's confident the investigation will show the restaurant is \"not at fault.\"", "source": {"uri": "freep.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Detroit Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type":

Two young children, a brother and sister, were killed in the crash. Several others -- including the siblings' mother and older brother -- were injured.\n\nThe Monroe County Prosecutor's Office is charging Chidester with eight crimes, including:\n\nTwo counts of second-degree murder -- which carries a punishment of up to life in prison.Two counts of operating under the influence of liquor causing death -- which carries a punishment of up to 15 years in prison.Four counts of operating under the influence of liquor causing serious injury -- which carries a punishment of up to 5 years in prison.\n\nChidester was given a $1.5 million bond, as was recommended by the prosecutor's office. The woman is not allowed to use alcohol, operate a vehicle or commit any other crimes while on bond, the judge said.\n\nDetails from the crash\n\nOn Saturday, April 20, a birthday party was taking place for a young child at the Swan Boat Club in Berlin Township, according to the Monroe County Sheriff's Office. The club is located off of Lake Erie.\n\nAt about 3 p.m., a suspected drunk driver drove into the building, crashing into a wall on the building's north side. The vehicle -- driven by Chidester -- stopped about 25 feet inside the building.\n\nTwo children were killed in the crash. They were identified as 8-year-old Alanah Phillips and her brother, 5-year-old Zayn Phillips.\n\nA third sibling and the children's mother were also injured in the crash. They were hospitalized in critical condition, according to a GoFundMe started for the family.\n\nOf the people injured Saturday, police said that nine of them -- three children and six adults -- had injuries and were taken to the hospital for treatment. It's believed that count includes the victims' mother and brother.\n\nWhat we learned at arraignment\n\nSince the onset of the investigation, authorities have said Chidester was believed to be drunk at the time of the crash. Chidester was at a nearby tavern before the crash, officials said.\n\nThe Monroe County prosecutor reiterated that point at Chidester's arraignment Tuesday. The prosecutor said an initial breath test showed Chidester's blood-alcohol level was \"well above\" the legal limit. Chidester also allegedly admitted that she wasn't supposed to be drinking, but did drink that day.\n\nChidester's defense attorney claimed the woman had only one glass of wine four hours before the crash at 3 p.m.\n\nThe defense also claimed Chidester had a seizure at the time of the crash -- something the woman had allegedly been experiencing over the past few months. Chidester's attorney said his client occasionally suffers from seizures in her legs, and that she's taking multiple medications because of it.\n\nThe prosecuting attorney said their investigation showed no evidence of a seizure happening at the time of the crash. Prosecutors also allege Chidester has a substance abuse problem and said that was corroborated by several people.\n\nThe defense argued that Chidester didn't have any history of criminal charges or traffic violations in hopes of getting the bond down to $100,000. The judge said he took that information into consideration, but decided on a $1.5 million bond due to the severity of the charges against the woman.\n\nChidester was initially arrested for operating a vehicle while intoxicated causing death. She was cooperating with the investigation, officials said then.\n\nSurveillance footage shows speeding car\n\nSurveillance video from a home nearby shows Chidester's vehicle speeding by before crashing into the boat club where the party was taking place.\n\nThat surveillance footage can be seen in the video report below.\n\nWho else was injured\n\nNine people were taken to the hospital on Saturday in ambulances and air ambulances, according to the Monroe County Sheriff's Office. One person, a 42-year-old man, received medical treatment on his own, officials said.\n\nHere is a list of the people injured and their conditions, as of 2:30 p.m. on Monday, April 22:\n\n31-year-old woman, critical condition.11-year-old boy, critical condition.18-year-old woman, serious condition.16-year-old girl, serious condition.14-year-old boy, serious condition.70-year-old woman, minor injuries.66-year-old woman, minor injuries.62-year-old woman, minor injuries.57-year-old woman, minor injuries.42-year-old man, minor injuries.GoFundMe set up for family\n\nA fundraising campaign was started for the family of the two children who were killed, and whose mother and other sibling were seriously hurt on Saturday. The GoFundMe, which was verified by the GoFundMe platform, is seeking to raise $200,000 to help with funeral services, as well as housing and medical expenses for the family.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, the campaign had raised more than its goal.\n\nClick here to see the GoFundMe.\n\nSchool district reaches out\n\nThe two children killed Saturday, and their older brother who is hospitalized, were members of the Flat Rock Community Schools district.\n\nDistrict Superintendent Andrew Brodie wrote a letter to families on Sunday, April 21.\n\n\"It is with a heavy heart that I reach out to you today following the tragic events that unfolded yesterday. A senseless accident occurred where a drunk driver crashed into Swan Creek Boat Club, resulting in the loss of two siblings who were students in our school (Early Childhood Center, Bobcean Elementary) and severe injuries of a third sibling (Simpson Middle School),\" Brodie said, in part.\n\n\"Our entire school community is reeling from this devastating news, and our hearts ache for the families and loved ones of those affected by this unimaginable tragedy. Words cannot adequately express the depth of our sorrow, nor can they ease the pain of those who are grieving. Please know that our thoughts and prayers are with every one of you during this incredibly difficult time.\"\n\nCounselors and social workers were expected to provide support at Flat Rock schools

Chidester limped into the courtroom Tuesday with her right arm in a splint.\n\nBill Colovos, Chidester's attorney, said his client is innocent until proven guilty.

Their mother, Mariah Dodds, filed a lawsuit Monday against Chidester and the bar police said she was drinking at before the crash.\n\nChidester crashed into the Swan Boat Club in the 6000 block of Brancheau in Berlin Township at about 3 p.m. Saturday, according to the Monroe County Sheriff's Office.

directly involved and those who witnessed this horrific incident,\" Goodnough said at a press conference Saturday night.\n\nThe boat club was closed Sunday, according to its website and Facebook page. \"Our deepest sympathy goes out to this family and everyone else that was involved,\" said the boat club's post. \"That family has asked us to post their go fund me to help with the funeral

Chidester is accused of driving under the influence and crashing her vehicle through a child's birthday party, killing two young siblings and injuring at least 10 other people.\n\nChidester was arraigned Tuesday on two counts of second-degree murder. She was also charged with two counts of operating under the influence of liquor causing death, and four counts of OUIL causing serious injury.\n\nA Monroe County judge set Chidester's bond at $1.5 million, which was the amount recommended by the prosecutor's office.\n\nThe judge said Tuesday that Chidester may not use alcohol, operate a vehicle, or commit any other crimes while on bond. She is also barred from leaving the state, or having any contact with the victims.\n\nChidester is scheduled to appear in court next on Tuesday, April 30 for a probable cause hearing. She is required to attend all pre-trial hearings while on bond.\n\nThe woman did not enter a plea during her arraignment this week.\n\nDetails from the crash\n\nOn Saturday, April 20, a birthday party was taking place for a young child at the Swan Boat Club in Berlin Township, according to the Monroe County Sheriff's Office. The club is located off of Lake Erie.\n\nAt about 3 p.m., a suspected drunk driver drove into the building, crashing into a wall on the building's north side. The vehicle -- driven by Chidester -- stopped about 25 feet inside the building.\n\nTwo children were killed in the crash. They were identified as 8-year-old Alanah Phillips and her brother, 5-year-old Zayn Phillips.\n\nA third sibling and the children's mother were also injured in the crash. They were hospitalized in critical condition, according to a GoFundMe started for the family.\n\nOf the people injured Saturday, police said that nine of them -- three children and six adults -- had injuries and were taken to the hospital for treatment. It's believed that count includes the victims' mother and brother.\n\n---> Related: Driver, bar sued by family of kids killed in Monroe County birthday party crash\n\nWhat we learned at arraignment\n\nSince the onset of the investigation, authorities have said Chidester was believed to be drunk at the time of the crash. Chidester was at a nearby tavern before the crash, officials said.\n\nThe Monroe County prosecutor reiterated that point at Chidester's arraignment Tuesday. The prosecutor said an initial breath test showed Chidester's blood-alcohol level was \"well above\" the legal limit. Chidester also allegedly admitted that she wasn't supposed to be drinking, but did drink that day.\n\nChidester's defense attorney claimed the woman had only one glass of wine four hours before the crash at 3 p.m.\n\nThe defense also claimed Chidester had a seizure at the time of the crash -- something the woman had allegedly been experiencing over the past few months. Chidester's attorney said his client occasionally suffers from seizures in her legs, and that she's taking multiple medications because of it.\n\nThe prosecuting attorney said their investigation showed no evidence of a seizure happening at the time of the crash. Prosecutors also allege Chidester has a substance abuse problem and said that was corroborated by several people.\n\nThe defense argued that Chidester didn't have any history of criminal charges or traffic violations in hopes of getting the bond down to $100,000. The judge said he took that information into consideration, but decided on a $1.5 million bond due to the severity of the charges against the woman.\n\nYou can watch the full arraignment down below.\n\nChidester was initially arrested for operating a vehicle while intoxicated causing death. She was cooperating with the investigation, officials said then.\n\nCharges and punishment\n\nThe Monroe County Prosecutor's Office charged Chidester with eight crimes, which also include the following punishments:\n\nTwo counts of second-degree murder -- which carries a punishment of up to life in prison.Two counts of operating under the influence of liquor causing death -- which carries a punishment of up to 15 years in prison.Four counts of operating under the influence of liquor causing serious injury -- which carries a punishment of up to 5 years in prison.Surveillance footage shows speeding car\n\nSurveillance video from a home nearby shows Chidester's vehicle speeding by before crashing into the boat club where the party was taking place.\n\nThat surveillance footage can be seen in the video report below.\n\nWho else was injured\n\nNine people were taken to the hospital on Saturday in ambulances and air ambulances, according to the Monroe County Sheriff's Office. One person, a 42-year-old man, received medical treatment on his own, officials said.\n\nHere is a list of the people injured and their conditions, as of 2:30 p.m. on Monday, April 22:\n\n31-year-old woman, critical condition.11-year-old boy, critical condition.18-year-old woman, serious condition.16-year-old girl, serious condition.14-year-old boy, serious condition.70-year-old woman, minor injuries.66-year-old woman, minor injuries.62-year-old woman, minor injuries.57-year-old woman, minor injuries.42-year-old man, minor injuries.GoFundMe set up for family\n\nA fundraising campaign was started for the family of the two children who were killed, and whose mother and other sibling were seriously hurt on Saturday. The GoFundMe, which was verified by the GoFundMe platform, is seeking to raise $200,000 to help with funeral services, as well as housing and medical expenses for the family.\n\nAs of Tuesday, April 23, the campaign had raised more than its goal.\n\nClick here to see the GoFundMe.\n\nWatch: Driver's arraignment\n\nThe entire April 23, 2024, arraignment hearing for Marshella Chidester can be seen below.\n\nSchool district reaches out\n\nThe two children killed Saturday, and their older brother who is hospitalized, were members of the Flat Rock Community Schools district.\n\nDistrict Superintendent Andrew Brodie wrote a letter to families on Sunday, April 21.\n\n\"It is with a heavy heart that I reach out to you today following the tragic events that unfolded yesterday. A senseless accident occurred where a drunk driver crashed into Swan Creek Boat Club, resulting in the loss of two siblings who were students in our school (Early Childhood Center, Bobcean Elementary) and severe injuries of a third sibling (Simpson Middle School),\" Brodie said, in part.\n\n\"Our entire school community is reeling from this devastating news, and our hearts ache for the families and loved ones of those affected by this unimaginable tragedy.

Throughout the 25-minute hearing, several of the victims' family members angrily interjected as her defense attorney argued against the bond requested by prosecutors. The judge ultimately agreed with the prosecution, ordering that she be held in jail on a $1.5 million bond.\n\nThe court entered a not guilty plea for Chidester, who faces two counts of second-degree murder in the deaths of 8-year-old Alanah Phillips and her 4-year-old brother, Zayn Phillips. Chidester also was charged with two counts of operating while intoxicated causing death and four counts of operating while intoxicated causing injury.\n\nMonroe County Prosecuting Attorney Jeffery A. Yorkey said Chidester's blood alcohol level was over the limit and that she admitted to drinking that day. Friends and family corroborated that she has a \"very severe substance abuse issue,\" making her a danger to the public, Yorkey added.\n\nDefense attorney Bill Colovos chided the prosecutor for not mentioning what he described as his client's months-long history of \"epileptic-type seizures\" in her legs. He said the condition caused Chidester's legs to periodically freeze - and that she had received treatment for the condition the day of the crash.\n\n\"In 60 years on this earth, she's never had any traffic involvement, she's never had any law enforcement involvement,\" Colovos said. \"I think that adds a little credibility to her side of the table.\"\n\nAfter a search warrant was executed on the tavern Chidester visited before the crash, receipts showed she ordered a single glass of wine and a bowl of chili, Colovos said. Four hours later, video footage captured by a doorbell camera would capture Chidester's black SUV barreling into the Swan Boat Club in Newport, Mich., a creekside recreation spot roughly 30 miles south of Detroit.\n\nColovos's defense of Chidester only further inflamed tensions in District Court Judge Christian Horkey's courtroom, drawing cries and shouts from the gallery.\n\n\"She was drinking!\" someone in the courtroom said.\n\nRaquel Smouthers, the sister of the victims' mother, Mariah Dodd, sobbed as she described her niece's \"flawless curly hair\" and love of dancing; and her nephew, who adored the rapper Eminem, a Michigan native, and loved to tell jokes.\n\n\"Those babies, I can tell you now, cannot have an open casket,\" Smouthers said.\n\nSmouthers said the children were sitting at a table eating when Chidester crashed through the wall of the Swan Boat Club around 3 p.m. on Saturday. Investigators said the car traveled about 25 feet inside the building before stopping.\n\nNine people were hospitalized, including Dodd and her eldest son. As of Monday, two people remained in the hospital in critical condition.\n\nChidester could face life in prison if convicted on the murder counts.\n\nSmouthers said she can now never look at the month of April the same way again and castigated Chidester for drinking and driving, especially if she had a medical condition.\n\n\"Nobody should ever have to go to a birthday party thinking they're going to die,\" Smouthers said.", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chidester,_Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chidester, Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chidester, Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monroe County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monroe County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blood alcohol content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavern", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tavern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drunk_driving", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drunk driving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coffin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminem", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eminem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport,_Rhode_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newport, Rhode Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newport, Rhode Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.adn.com/resizer//OkERqhojCfVhsmk_OK2R_n8ciik=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/ID6BXUKTFFABZKTYFLFQ3UH4AE.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505569", "eventUri": "eng-9505569", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

He said Chidester is \"not a monster,\" rather she suffered seizure that caused paralysis in her legs while she was driving, causing her to lose control of her car. But Yorkey said her blood alcohol level was \"significantly higher\" than the legal limit of .08, though he did not give the figure.\n\n\"She is a danger to this community,\" Yorkey said. \"And that is illustrated no clearer than the two dead children she is directly responsible for.\"\n\nThe judge set Chidester's bond at $1.5 million.

the children's mother has also now filed a suit against Chidester and the tavern she allegedly drank at before getting back into her car, according to AP News.\n\nA GoFundMe has been set up to help cover funeral expenses for the children.\n\nChidester is scheduled to appear in a probable cause conference scheduled for April 30 followed by a May 6 preliminary examination.", "source": {"uri":

He said she experienced one of those seizures, and that's what caused her to crash into the building.\n\nThe defense pointed out that Chidester had no prior criminal history -- not even a speeding ticket. Colovos said she's retired and has lived with her husband at their home for 40 years.\n\nColovos also said that at the time of the crash, Chidester was not under doctor instructions that forbade her from driving.\n\nProsecution's response\n\nThe prosecution pointed to the reported BAC, Chidester's apparent admissions about drinking, and a history of alcohol use outlined by another boat club member.\n\nLoved ones of the children who were killed said Chidester should have known it wasn't safe to drive if she was having seizures.

Throughout the 25-minute hearing, several of the victims' family members angrily interjected as her defense attorney argued against the bond requested by prosecutors. The judge ultimately agreed with the prosecution, ordering that she be held in jail on $1.5 million bond.\n\nThe court entered a not guilty plea for Chidester, who faces two counts of second-degree murder in the deaths of 8-year-old Alanah Phillips and her 4-year-old brother, Zayn Phillips. Chidester also was charged with two counts of operating while intoxicated causing death and four counts of operating while intoxicated causing injury.\n\nMonroe County Prosecuting Attorney Jeffery A. Yorkey said Chidester's blood alcohol level was over the limit and that she admitted to drinking that day. Friends and family corroborated that she suffers from a \"very severe substance abuse issue,\" making her a danger to the public, Yorkey added.\n\nDefense attorney Bill Colovos chided the prosecutor for not mentioning what he described as his client's months-long history of \"epileptic-type seizures\" in her legs. He said the condition caused Chidester's legs to periodically freeze -- and that she had received treatment for the condition the day of the crash.\n\n\"In 60 years on this earth, she's never had any traffic involvement, she's never had any law enforcement involvement,\" Colovos said. \"I think that adds a little credibility to her side of the table.\"\n\nAfter a search warrant was executed on the tavern Chidester visited before the crash, receipts showed she ordered a single glass of wine and a bowl of chili, Colovos said. Four hours later, video footage captured by a doorbell camera would capture Chidester's black SUV barreling into the Swan Boat Club in Newport, Mich., a creekside recreation spot roughly 30 miles north of Detroit.\n\nColovos's defense of Chidester only further inflamed tensions in District Court Judge Christian Horkey's courtroom, drawing cries and shouts from the gallery.\n\n\"She was drinking!\" someone in the courtroom said.\n\nRaquel Smouthers, the sister of the victims' mother, Mariah Dodd, sobbed as she described her niece's \"flawless curly hair\" and love of dancing, and her nephew, who adored the rapper Eminem, a Michigan native, and loved to tell jokes.\n\n\"Those babies, I can tell you now, cannot have an open casket,\" Smouthers said.\n\nSmouthers said the children were sitting at a table eating when Chidester crashed through the wall of the Swan Boat Club around 3 p.m. on April 20. Investigators said the car traveled about 25 feet inside the building before stopping.\n\nNine people were hospitalized, including Dodd and her eldest son. As of Monday, two people remained in the hospital in critical condition.\n\nChidester could face life in prison if convicted on the murder counts.\n\nSmouthers said she can now never look at the month of April the same way again and castigated Chidester for drinking and driving, especially if she had a medical condition.\n\n\"Nobody should ever have to go to a birthday party thinking they're going to die,\" Smouthers said.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kim_bellware@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Kim Bellware",

Yorkey said in a statement obtained by PEOPLE.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, Chidester allegedly sped through the parking lot of the Swan Boat Club in Berlin Township, where she used to be the commodore, and crashed through a building where a children's birthday party was being held, Monroe County Sheriff Troy Goodnough said at a press conference later that day.\n\nKilled in the crash were 8-year-old Lana Phillips and her 4-year -old brother, Zayn Phillips, according to a GoFundMe posted by their aunt, Diane Harrington.\n\nThey were pronounced dead at the scene, Goodnough said.\n\nSeriously injured in the accident were the children's mother, Mariah, and 11-year-old brother, Jayden, who were in critical condition after the accident, Harrington said in the GoFundMe.\n\nAdditional charges involve the serious injuries to a 14-year-old male and an 18-year-old female, Yorkey said in the release.\n\nChidester's bond was set at $1.5 million.\n\nHer attorney, Bill Colovos, argued that Chidester, who came to court with her arm in a sling, had seizures in her legs before that crash, NBC News reports. He said Chidester drives \"like a little old lady\" and has no criminal record, The Detroit News reports.\n\nSince November, he said, she has had epileptic-type seizures in her legs that have led to paralysis, which she was treated for the day of the accident, the News reports.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Monroe County judge how Chidester's alleged actions have affected them.\n\n\"I had to be the one to tell my sister her babies were gone when they removed her ventilator yesterday,\" Mariah's sister, Raquel Smouthers, told the judge in between sobs, the Free Press reports.\n\n\"She said: 'How am I supposed to live without my babies?'\"\n\nThe children's grandmother, Kathy Phillips, alleged, \"She

Chidester was arraigned Tuesday on eight criminal charges, including second-degree murder, after the crash killed two young siblings and injured several other people at Swan Boat Club in Berlin Township.\n\nThe crash killed 8-year-old Alanah Phillips and her brother, 5-year-old Zayn Phillips. The children's mother Mariah Dodds and their 11-year-old brother J.P. were also injured in the crash, and were hospitalized in critical condition. About a dozen other people were injured, many of them hospitalized, as well.\n\nDodds suffered from six broken ribs, a collapsed lung, severe cuts and more, according to attorneys representing the family. Dodds' son J.P. reportedly suffered from two broken legs, broken ribs, and a fractured skull due to the crash. They were both expected to have a \"long road to recovery\" ahead of them.\n\nAttorneys for Dodds on Monday, April 22 filed a lawsuit against Chidester and Verna's Tavern, the nearby bar that Chidester was at before the crash. The lawsuit claims Chidester was grossly negligent and operated her vehicle \"recklessly\" and while under the influence. The lawsuit also targets the tavern, alleging the business is responsible for selling alcohol to Chidester while she was \"visibly intoxicated,\" and failed to stop her from leaving in her car.\n\nThe specifics of Chidester's state of mind at the time of the crash weren't immediately clear, and were even being debated during the woman's arraignment hearing Tuesday. The Monroe County prosecutor said Chidester's breath test showed her blood-alcohol level was \"well above\" the legal limit, but her defense attorney said she only drank one glass of wine four hours before the crash.\n\nChidester's attorney also claimed the woman experiences occasional seizures in her legs, and said that's what happened at the time of the crash.\n\n---> More: Monroe woman charged with murder in birthday party crash that killed 2 kids\n\nDodds is seeking damages of \"whatever amount above $25,000 is fair, just, and based on the evidence presented at trial,\" the lawsuit reads. The two children killed in the crash will be added to the lawsuit once an estate is opened for them, attorneys said. You can see the entire lawsuit down below.\n\nLawyers were expected to share more information at a press conference Wednesday morning.\n\nDetails from the crash\n\nOn Saturday, April 20, a birthday party was taking place for a young child at the Swan Boat Club in Berlin Township, according to the Monroe County Sheriff's Office. The club is located off of Lake Erie.\n\nAt about 3 p.m., a suspected drunk driver drove into the building, crashing into a wall on the building's north side. The vehicle -- driven by Chidester -- stopped about 25 feet inside the building.\n\nAlanah Phillips and Zayn Phillips were killed, while more than a dozen other people were injured. Nine of the injured people -- three children and six adults -- were taken to the hospital for treatment. It's believed that count includes the victims' mother and brother.\n\nNine people were taken to the hospital on Saturday in ambulances and air ambulances, according to the Monroe County Sheriff's Office. One person, a 42-year-old man, received medical treatment on his own, officials said.\n\nHere is a list of the people injured and their conditions, as of Monday, April 22:\n\n31-year-old woman (Mariah Dodds), critical condition.11-year-old boy (J.P.), critical condition.18-year-old woman, serious condition.16-year-old girl, serious condition.14-year-old boy, serious condition.70-year-old woman, minor injuries.66-year-old woman, minor injuries.62-year-old woman, minor injuries.57-year-old woman, minor injuries.42-year-old man, minor injuries.Read the full lawsuit here\n\nThe entire lawsuit filed April 22, 2024, against Chidester and Verna's Tavern can be found below.\n\nGoFundMe set up for family\n\nA fundraising campaign was started for the family of the two children who were killed, and whose mother and other sibling were seriously hurt on Saturday. The GoFundMe, which was verified by the GoFundMe platform, is seeking to raise $200,000 to help with funeral services, as well as housing and medical expenses for the family.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the campaign had raised more than its goal.\n\nClick here to see the GoFundMe.", "source": {"uri": "clickondetroit.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WDIV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cassidy_johncox@clickondetroit.com", "name": "Cassidy Johncox", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drunk_driving", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drunk driving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monroe County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monroe County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Township,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berlin Township, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin Township, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_of_the_peace", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Justice of the peace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavern", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tavern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumothorax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pneumothorax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_fracture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skull fracture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_negligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gross negligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathalyzer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breathalyzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blood alcohol content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol intoxication"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/LII2J4IUXVHS7IC7ADOOLGWKXU.png?_a=ATAPphC0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505569", "eventUri": "eng-9505569", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin Township, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-23", "textStart": 220, "textEnd": 228}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-20", "textStart": 374, "textEnd": 382, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-22", "textStart": 1242, "textEnd": 1250, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.6549019607843137, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Accused drunk driver's ties to boat club ran deep before crash", "body": "Berlin Township -- A list of names and phone numbers is taped to the door of the Swan Boat Club, directing delivery drivers about whom to call if the club is empty.\n\nMarshella Chidester's name is second on the list.\n\nThe 66-year-old Chidester's connection to the Swan Boat Club seemed pleasant before it turned tragic Saturday. The Monroe resident once served as the club's commodore, or top official, and for decades she's lived just few yards down a gravel road from the boat club that abuts Swan Creek, a canal off Lake Erie in the shadow of the Fermi 2 nuclear plant where Chidester worked in DTE Energy management before retiring nine years ago.\n\nProsecutors said Chidester was intoxicated at about 3 p.m. Saturday as she sped down the unpaved thoroughfare, Brancheau Road, past her waterfront home and drove her car through the boat club's wall during a children's birthday party. The impact killed siblings Alanah Phillips, 8, and Zayn Phillips, 4, and wounded at least 13 others, police said, including the Phillipses' mother and older brother.\n\nThe damage from the crash has been repaired by wood panels that are painted blue to match the surrounding wall. A collection of stuffed animals, crucifixes and other items are arranged outside the club.\n\nChidester's Facebook account shows sporadic posts about Swan Boat Club events, along with photos where she's wearing what appears to be a blue nautical uniform with stars on the sleeves. During 2017, Chidester was the Swan Boat Club's commodore -- the principal officer who helps to determine the club's direction, including usually setting the agenda for the year.\n\nBut during her Tuesday arraignment in Monroe County's 1st District Court, Chidester was dressed in a black-and-white striped uniform from the Monroe County Jail, where she was being held in lieu of $1.5 million bond.\n\nChidester was charged with two counts of second-degree murder, two counts of operating under the influence of alcohol causing death and four counts of operating under the influence of alcohol causing serious injury. She faces up to life in prison if she's convicted.\n\nMariah Dodd, the mother of the two children who were killed, on Monday filed a lawsuit in Monroe County's 38th Circuit Court, naming Chidester and Verna's Tavern as defendants. The lawsuit alleges the bar is responsible for Chidester's actions because they continued serving her alcohol even after she was visibly drunk. Police said Chidester had left the bar when the accident occurred.\n\nBar officials have not responded to requests for comment. Bill Colovos, Chidester's attorney, told reporters after Tuesday's arraignment that a search warrant of Verna's Tavern found that his client had only consumed one glass of wine and a bowl of chili for lunch from 11 a.m. to noon Saturday. He said police were too quick to blame the bar and name them to the media when they \"didn't do anything wrong.\"\n\n\"In 60 years on this earth, she's never had any traffic involvement she's never had any law enforcement involvement,\" Colovos said. \"It's horrible what happened, absolutely horrible ..., but some things we don't have control over.\"\n\nHe said Chidester drives \"like a little old lady\" and has a history since November of having epileptic-type seizures in her legs that result in paralysis. She was treated for it that day, he said.\n\nMonroe County Prosecutor Jeffrey Yorkey said there was no evidence Chidester had a seizure the day of the crash. A \"very long investigation,\" including a breath test, indicated she was significantly over the legal limit, Yorkey said, but didn't specify the exact result.\n\nWhen Chidester was arrested Saturday, police confiscated her driver's license and issued a temporary paper license -- known as a 625G permit, according to Michigan Secretary of State records. Michigan law says a driver's license must be confiscated if a driver is intoxicated or refuses to perform a substance test. The permit doesn't restrict driving privileges instantaneously; it remains in effect until the driver's case is resolved.\n\nThe Swan Boat Club has been closed since the accident. Phone calls to boat club officials were either not returned, or those who answered declined to comment.\n\nChidester lived in her house since 1985, according to real estate records, and she worked at the nearby Fermi 2 nuclear plant as a strategic buyer, according to her LinkedIn account. She left DTE nine years ago, company spokeswoman Lisa Bolla said in a Tuesday email.\n\n\"We're devastated by the tragedy at the Swan Boat Club. Many of our DTE family live in the community and have children who are schoolmates of those who lost their life,\" Bolla said. \"All of us at DTE join our neighbors, friends and community in mourning this tragedy. Our thoughts remain with the families affected and the first responders who rushed to the scene.\"", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monroe County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monroe County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chidester,_Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chidester, Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chidester, Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Commodore (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bar (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drunk_driving", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drunk driving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enrico Fermi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_township", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil township"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Erie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lake Erie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gravel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTE_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DTE Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crucifix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circuit court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_responder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First responder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Watercraft", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Wooden_Boats", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Wooden Boats", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Watercraft", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/04/23/PDTN/73425788007-ja-68635.jpg?auto=webp&crop=3599,2025,x0,y187&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505569", "eventUri": "eng-9505569", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

club killing children, sued by mother", "body": "A critically injured mother forced to deal with the deaths of her two children, and life-threatening injuries to her oldest son and herself, has filed a lawsuit against a woman charged in a building crash.\n\nMariah Dodds, who had to be told about the deaths of 8-year-old daughter, Alanah, and 4-year-old son, Zayn Phillips, upon regaining consciousness in her hospital room, is suing Marshella Chidester for gross negligence, as well as Verna's Tavern in Monroe County.\n\nChidester has been charged with eight felonies, which include two second-degree murder charges.\n\nShe also is charged with two counts of operating while intoxicated causing death and four counts of operating while intoxicated causing serious injury.\n\nIt is alleged that Chidester was intoxicated on April 20 when she drove her car through the Swan Boat Club, where a child's birthday party was being held.\n\nNearly a dozen people were injured, some critically, from the force of the car that slammed into the wall about 25 feet before stopping.\n\nThe lawsuit, which also is filed by her son, listed on the document at \"JP,\" targets the Monroe County tavern where it is believed she stopped that day before the crash.\n\nThe tavern is located about 200 yards from Chidester's house.\n\nIt appears she almost made it home.\n\nWhen contacted about a statement on the lawsuit, an employee answering the phone from Verna's said, \"No,\" and hung up the phone.\n\nChidester's lawyer, Bill Colovos, addressed the court during his client's arraignment, saying that she only had a glass of wine and a bowl of chili at the tavern.\n\nHe noted that his client doesn't have a documented history of a drinking issue, record of criminal behavior, or even a traffic ticket.\n\nNevertheless, a longtime member of the boat club also spoke at the arraignment and said he is familiar with Chidester.\n\nHe said during his 10 years as a member he has seen her highly intoxicated and has witnessed other people try to walk her out the door dozens of times.\n\nHe brought up the fact that Chidester hit a truck and tree before crashing into the club.\n\nIt is his belief, he told the court, that she was fleeing from that incident so she wouldn't get caught driving drunk, then hitting a speed bump and ditch that made her lose control and crash.\n\nUnlike some others, he said he does not believe she hit the building on purpose.\n\nColovos told the court Chidester began suffering from seizures back in November and said they occur in her legs.\n\nDodds was reportedly about to sit down with her children and eat just before tragedy struck.\n\nDuring the arraignment, her sister received permission from the judge to speak and she said seeing the children in the chaotic aftermath is a sight they will never be able to be able to escape.\n\nThe two children killed were students in Flat Rock Community Schools, which made counselors available for students and staff.\n\nAt the last update, those transported to hospitals via ambulance or air ambulance service (helicopter) and their condition included the following:\n\n* 31-year-old

So did her 11-year-old son. Both are hospitalized.\n\nDodds and her surviving son's family relationship is now \"destroyed,\" as they witnessed the crash that killed their loved ones, the lawsuit states.\n\nThe Free Press could not reach an attorney for Chidester or anyone on her behalf. No one was at her home Monday morning when a reporter visited. She lives on Brancheau Street in Newport, which is less than 200 yards from the boat club. She lives there with her husband, according to property records.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by Dodds and her son, identified in the lawsuit as \"J.P.,\" accuses Chidester of gross negligence. Chidester is alleged to have driven into the north wall of the boat club fast enough to go about 25 feet inside the building until her vehicle stopped. A witness previously told the Free Press he thought he could see children lining up for cake inside.\n\nThe witness described a loud crash that could be heard numerous houses down the gravel road, and the screams of children and adults that followed.\n\nDodds' attorney, Michael Jones, could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nChidester was taken into custody after the crash on suspicion of operating a vehicle while intoxicated causing death, officials said. On Tuesday morning, Chidester was charged with eight counts, including two counts of second-degree homicide. Monroe County Prosecutor Jeffery Yorkey said he expected Chidester would be arraigned on the charges Tuesday morning.\n\nChidester had been an officer of the boat club, acting as a commodore for the group. Her mother was a charter member of the club, according to the mother's 2006 obituary.\n\nChidester worked at DTE as a manager at Fermi 2, as a strategic buyer, according to her LinkedIn page and the Monroe News.\n\nShe graduated from Newport's Jefferson High School in 1975, later attending Siena Heights University and getting a master's of business administration degree from Davenport University, Dearborn, according to an archived story in the Monroe News.\n\nMore: Child, woman in critical condition in aftermath of Monroe County boat club crash\n\nMore: Driver in suspected DUI crash that killed 2 children may have left Monroe County tavern earlier\n\nThe lawsuit also argues that Verna's Tavern is also liable. The bar allegedly sold Chidester alcohol while visibly intoxicated, according to the lawsuit, and continued drinking until she left the bar and ultimately crashed into the Swam Boat Club at 3 p.m. Saturday.\n\nVerna's Tavern should have stopped selling Chidester alcohol and should have provided alternate transportation to her home, the lawsuit argues.\n\nSheriff's deputies briefly closed Verna's Tavern after the crash as part of the crash investigation.\n\nThe tavern's attorney, John McManus, of Royal Oak, could not immediately be reached for comment.In an email to the Free Press, Angie Huffman, who said that her mother owns Verna's, confirmed the suspect was there at 11 a.m., had a glass of wine and a bowl of soup, adding that she's confident the investigation will show the restaurant is \"not at fault.\"\n\nStaff writers Frank Witsil and Christine MacDonald contributed to this report.

Chidester was arraigned earlier today in 1st District Court where she was charged with two counts of second-degree murder along with six other felonies related to Saturday's crash.\n\nChidester is accused of being under the influence when her vehicle crashed through a wall at the boat club where a child's birthday party was ongoing. Eight-year-old Alanah Phillips and her 4-year-old brother, Zayn Phillips, were pronounced dead at the scene following the crash and nine other people were transported to the hospital for treatment via ambulance or air ambulance.\n\nDodds suffered multiple injuries in the incident as well, including broken ribs, a collapsed lung, cuts and bruises. Another one of her children was also injured and suffered broken legs, broken ribs and a fractured skull.\n\nAlong with Chidester, the lawsuit also names a local tavern that Chidester allegedly visited prior to the crash. During Tuesday's arraignment, Chidester's attorney, Bill Colovos, claimed his client visited the tavern from 11 a.m. to noon and only had a bowl of chili and a glass of wine.

WDIV\n\nAn intoxicated driver was charged with murder after crashing into a Michigan business where a child's birthday party was being held and killing two young siblings, the Monroe County Prosecuting Attorney's Office announced Tuesday.\n\nMarshella Chidester, 66, hit a building at Swan Boat Club in Berlin Charter Township around 3 p.m. on Saturday. It came to a stop 25 feet inside where the party was taking place, Monroe County Sheriff Troy Goodnough told reporters Saturday.\n\nIn an arraignment hearing Tuesday, Chidester was charged with two counts of second-degree murder, two courts of operating under the influence of alcohol causing death and four counts of operating under the influence of alcohol causing serious injury. Her bond was set at $1.5 million.\n\nZayn Phillips, 5, and his sister, Alanah Phillips, 8, were declared dead at the scene, Goodnough said in an update Monday. Authorities did not clarify if the party was for either of the children.\n\nA third sibling survived with \"severe injuries,\" according to Andrew Brodie, the superintendent of Flat Rock Community Schools, an area public school district.\n\nAt the arraignment, Bill Colovos, an attorney for Chidester, said she has a history of epileptic seizures in her legs and lost control of the car when she crashed. He also said that his client only had one glass of wine four hours before the crash, according to a search warrant executed at the bar where she allegedly was.\n\n\"This is not a monster,\" Colovos said about his client, adding that she doesn't have a criminal history. \"It's horrible what happened, absolutely horrible. I have two children. It's absolutely horrible. But some things we don't have control over.\"\n\nA woman who identified herself as the grandmother of Zayn and Alanah spoke at the arraignment, accusing Chidester of drinking and driving.\n\n\"She chose to drink and drive, and she took my grandbabies from us,\" the woman said.\n\nA woman who identified herself as the aunt of the two children said she was at the scene of the crash, and saw her niece and nephew in their final moments.\n\n\"They walked into that birthday party having a fun time,\" she said. \"They were sitting at that table, eating, and this woman crashed her car through this building, destroying all of our lives. Not just my family, everyone else that was in that building.\"\n\nShe says her other nephew and her sister, the children's mother, were hurt in the crash and are still fighting for their lives.\n\n\"I had to be the one to tell my sister her babies were gone when they removed her ventilator yesterday,\" the woman said. \"She said 'How am I supposed to live without my babies?'\"\n\n\"No one should ever have to go to a birthday party thinking that they're gonna die,\" she said tearfully.\n\nApproximately 13 others were injured in the crash, Goodnough said on Saturday. Nine of those people, who range in age from 11 to 66-years-old, were hospitalized, according to the Monroe County Sheriff's Office.\n\nFive remain in critical condition, including an 11-year-old boy, a 14-year-old boy, a 16-year-old girl, an 18-year-old woman and a 31-year-old woman.\n\nThe four other victims, who range in age from 57 to 70, had minor injuries.

It's horrible what happened, but some things we don't have control over,\" Colovos said when asking for a $100,000 bond with cash/surety 10%.\n\nThe arraignment was interrupted several times on Zoom by people watching, including a woman who said she was the grandmother of the children who were killed.\n\nA third sibling was seriously injured in the crash, as was their mother, Mariah Dodds.\n\nRaquel Smothers, the aunt of the three children, also spoke during the arraignment in person, saying, \"We were supposed to be planning a birthday party for Zayn not a funeral.\"\n\nMarko Law via AP\n\n\"They walked into that birthday party having a fun time. They were sitting at that table eating and this woman crashed her car through this building, destroying all of our lives,\" she added.\n\nThe brother of the kids' father also spoke via Zoom during the arraignment.\n\n\"My brother is in the hospital right now praying that his little boy comes through and he still gotta tell his son that he lost his sister and brother,\" he said.\n\nThe judge set a probable cause hearing for April 30 with a preliminary examination scheduled for May 6.\n\nOn Tuesday, Marko Law, PLLC announced a lawsuit filed against the suspected driver and Verna's Tavern following the fatal crash. A press conference is scheduled for 10 a.m. on April 24.\n\nAn attorney representing Verna's Tavern told 7 News Detroit that the suspect was at the establishment between 11 a.m. and noon Saturday, hours before the deadly crash. He added that the woman's order was reportedly just over $7 and included a glass of wine and chili.\n\nAttorney John McManus released the following statement on behalf of Verna's Tavern:\n\n\"We are saddened beyond words by the news of this horrible tragedy. Our most sincere thoughts and prayers go out to all those that lost their lives, their family members, witnesses and all of our Community that is in pain due to this incident. We ask for patience during the investigation and that the Justice system be allowed to work to uncover the actual facts surrounding the accident.\"\n\nThis story was originally published by Scripps News Detroit.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Township,_Michigan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berlin Township, Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motor vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Driving under the influence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Global Positioning System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_ticket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Traffic ticket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripps_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scripps News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Probable cause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 14}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/tyAGPqp_If6v5ev8vju0OA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02MjI-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_newsy_441/b7b77f218b7a0fab41e5bde28f54e318", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505569", "eventUri": "eng-9505569", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 2356, "textEnd": 2364}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 2410, "textEnd": 2415}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 2594, "textEnd": 2602}], "sentiment": -0.592156862745098, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

The Monroe County Sheriff's Office said first responders took nine people to area hospitals and two of them remain in critical condition, including an 11-year-old boy and a 31-year-old woman. The sheriff said other people went to hospitals in private vehicles to get checked out.\n\nThe Monroe County prosecutor Jeffery Yorkey asked for a $1.5 million bond, citing an alleged severe substance abuse issue and the high likelihood of conviction because of video evidence.\n\nChidester's attorney countered, saying that his client has never even had a traffic ticket, and has had seizures since November of last year, and was taking medication for sporadic paralysis of her legs. He said that surveillance video from Verna's Bar, where Chidester was prior to the crash, it showed her having one glass of wine and a bowl of chili.\n\nThe prosecutor responded, saying that Chidester's blood alcohol content was over the legal limit.\n\nThe sister of one of the victims, Raquel Smithers, spoke at the hearing, describing what she saw after the vehicle crashed into the birthday party.\n\n\"We were supposed to be planning a birthday party for Zayn, not a funeral!\"", "source": {"uri": "13abc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.13abc.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monroe County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monroe County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTVG", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WTVG"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_County,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monroe County, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monroe County, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_responder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First responder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_township", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil township"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_pepper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chili pepper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blood alcohol content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paralysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_ticket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Traffic ticket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://gray-wtvg-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/D7IMF2XB5VELBETTNULV2I4SGY.png?auth=12e4d26b1a26a4f2c8193e6790e534fe69e63e7030fbafdef80fb82d15715c06&width=1200&height=600&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505569", "eventUri": "eng-9505569", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.6470588235294117, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The SUV came to rest about 25 feet inside the building after smashing through on the north side.\n\nSurveillance video from a nearby home shows Chidester's SUV speeding toward the boat club.\n\nSiblings Alanah Phillips, 8, and Zayn Phillips, 5, were killed in the crash. Their older brother, mother, and seven other people were taken to the hospital with injuries.\n\nPolice said Chidester was drunk at the time of the crash because she had just been at a nearby tavern.\n\n\"There was a preliminary breath test done which indicated that her blood-alcohol level was significantly over the legal limit,\" a Monroe County prosecutor said at the arraignment.\n\nOfficials said Chidester admitted at the crash scene that she had been drinking when she wasn't supposed to.\n\nDefense's claims\n\nChidester's attorney claims she only had one glass of wine that day, and that it was between 11 a.m. and noon -- about four hours before the crash. He said the only other item she ordered at the tavern was a bowl of chili.\n\nThe defense is claiming that Chidester has a history of \"epileptic-type seizures\" seizures dating back to November. Her attorney said one of those seizures is what caused the crash.\n\n\"Sometimes you have a seizure and your leg seizes up,\" he said.\n\nThe defense attorney said Chidester is retired and lives with her husband \"about 400 feet\" away from the crash scene. He said she has never had any trouble with the law -- not even a speeding ticket.\n\nThe defense attorney said that at the time of the crash, she was not under doctor instructions not to drive, even though she was on medication for the seizures.\n\nBond dispute\n\nThe majority of Tuesday's court proceedings centered on bond. Prosecutors asked for Chidester to be held on a $1.5 million bond, while the defense asked for it to be $100,000 with the conditions of home confinement and an alcohol monitor.\n\nDuring the bond arguments, several people were allowed to speak.\n\nGrandmother speaks over Zoom\n\nThe first person to speak up was the grandmother of the two children who were killed. She was following the arraignment virtually.\n\n\"She chose to drink, and those are my grand-babies,\" the grandmother said. \"She made that choice to get in that car and she chose to drink and drive, and she took my grand-babies from us.\"\n\nAunt speaks inside courtroom\n\nThe only family member to speak from inside the courtroom was the children's aunt.\n\nHere's what she said:\n\n\"What he had said about getting injections in her legs for something -- knowing that, with or without drinking, you're still putting people in harm's way, because with muscles and everything, you can't control something. Why operate a vehicle knowing you're taking medicine that drinking will affect it?\n\n\"I was there. I saw where my daughter, my mom, my sister, my nephew from the opposite side of the family, my sister's three children -- we were supposed to be planning a birthday party for Zayn, not a funeral.\n\n\"Knowing you have medical conditions, you should never get behind a wheel, whether you are drinking or not -- taking medications, they tell you not to drink. But she still chose to drink. She still chose to get into that vehicle.\n\n\"I will never look at the month of April the same ever again. My birthday was a few days prior. The babies were just at my house. My niece, with her flawless, curly hair, loved to dance. My nephew -- he always hated that my truck was dirty. I cleaned my truck out just for him. He loved cracking jokes. Eminem was his idol.\n\n\"They walked into that birthday party having a fun time. They were sitting at that table, eating, and this woman crashed her car through this building, destroying all of our lives. Not just my family -- everyone else that was in that building.\n\n\"My nephew and my sister are still fighting for their lives today. I had to be the one to tell my sister her babies were gone when they removed her ventilator yesterday. She said, 'How am I supposed to live without my babies?'\n\n\"Nobody should ever have to go to a birthday party thinking that they're going to die. Medical history or not: Every medication tells you not to drink. She knew it. She shouldn't have done it. I had to see my deceased niece and nephew. I had to see their very last moment before that car was removed.\n\n\"I saw it, and my sister can't decide what she wants, and the babies, I can tell you right now, cannot have an open casket. It's a horrible, traumatic thing. I cannot close my eyes at night without seeing the babies and what they look like.\"\n\nFather's brother speaks over Zoom\n\nThe brother of the children's father also spoke over Zoom.\n\nHere's what he said:\n\n\"This woman deliberately, without even hitting the brake, destroyed my brother's life. Those were his babies. His little girl used to go to his basketball games, and now that little girl's not going to be able to go see him. Their father, because a woman, who claims to have ties to her community, wants to drive and hit the gas even further, when she got to that parking lot, and destroyed multiple lives.\n\n\"My brother is in the hospital right now, praying that his little boy comes through, and he's still got to tell his son that he lost his sister and brother. How is that right or how is that even fair? How is it even justified because the woman says that she's got some type of medical issue?\n\n\"As my sister said, you take medicine for years. You're an adult. You can read the label. It says, 'Do not drink.' You can't sit here and tell me one drink would do that. You can't. I'm a highly educated man. You can't tell me that. There's no justifying what she did to my family. There's none. This will never, ever be right.\n\n\"There never is a world that anybody can sit here and say or she can say it was an accident. That was not an accident. I know what accidents look like. They happen all the time on the freeway. If she was not drunk, as people are claiming -- her house is three houses away from what she did. Why didn't she just go home? Why didn't she? It's right there, three houses away from where she did that stuff that she did to my brother's family -- three houses. Why didn't she go home?\n\n\"So, you that's defending her, you should feel ashamed for even trying to stick up for -- 'oh, only one drink.' One drink doesn't do that, sir, and it never will.\"\n\nAnother mother speaks\n\nA woman whose children were at the boat club at the time of the crash spoke next. She was also attending the arraignment virtually.\n\n\"I drove there,\" she said. \"My three children were there, and whether you're having a seizure or not, that was intentional. You couldn't drive the way that those roads bend, and the way that you drive in there -- there is no way that that woman was not conscious in turning that vehicle.\n\n\"She aimed it right there, right at the bar where, probably, her husband should have been sitting. I don't know what her intentions were, but I can tell you it was on purpose and it was intentional. You can tell. We all know it.\"\n\nBoat club member speaks\n\nA member of the boat club spoke next over Zoom.\n\n\"During my 10 years of being a member of the boat club, most of the time I've seen her, she's been highly intoxicated,\" he said. \"I've watched people try to walk her out the door dozens and dozens of times, and one of the things that aren't brought up here is that she hit a vehicle down the road and a tree down the road.\n\n\"I believe that it wasn't intentional, but I do believe it was a situation where she was trying to flee and run from what she had just done down the road, because she shouldn't have been driving, and everybody knew that. (If) you're a member of the boat club, you know this lady shouldn't be driving, and I believe she was fleeing that scene.\n\n\"There's a speed bump before you enter the parking lot to the boat club, as well as a runoff ditch that you've got to pass over with your vehicle. We all drive 10 mph through that area because of these, and it's a narrow road. But I believe that she was fleeing from hitting the truck so that she wouldn't get caught drunk driving, and in doing so, hit the speed bump, as well as the little ditch that's 30 feet past that, and lost control of her vehicle.\n\n\"I don't believe it's intentional, but I do believe that, and I know, that she drinks a lot and should never get behind a wheel. And if you're under that much medicine, as her attorney states, then even one glass of wine could potentially do you like this. And not only that: A lot of medications you're not supposed to drive on.\n\n\"So whether it's the alcohol or the medication or neither, this lady should never be behind a wheel. We've watched her take baby steps to get out of the place because she can barely walk, let alone get behind a wheel. For such a frail lady to cause such devastation in her car, I think that she shouldn't be freed on bond because of this.\n\n\"I believe it's decades of her drunk driving that just caught up to her, is what I believe, and decades of her driving under the influence of, whether it be pills or alcohol, and I would point toward alcohol, from my experience of knowing her.\"\n\nBond decision\n\nThe judge sided with the prosecution and set bond at $1.5 million.\n\nChidester isn't allowed to have alcohol or other substances. She can't drive or commit any other crimes, if she's released.\n\nInjuries\n\nPolice said the 31-year-old mother of the children and their 11-year-old brother were both taken to the hospital in critical condition.\n\nThree others were taken to the hospital in serious condition: an 18-year-old woman, a 16-year-old girl, and a 14-year-old boy.\n\nFour women, ages 70, 66, 62, and 57, were taken to the hospital with minor injuries.\n\nA 42-year-old man with minor injuries received medical treatment on his own, according to police.\n\nAt the time of the crash, police originally said 15 people had been injured. It's unclear if that original number was too high or if there are more injuries on top of the 10 listed above.\n\nCharges\n\nChidester is facing the following charges:\n\nTwo counts of second-degree murder -- felonies with a maximum punishment of life in prison.Two counts of operating under the influence of liquor causing death -- felonies with a maximum punishment of 15 years in prison.Four counts of operating under the influence of liquor causing serious injury felonies with a maximum punishment of five years in prison.Fundraiser for family\n\nA GoFundMe has been set up for the family of the children who were killed. The fundraiser has been verified by the GoFundMe platform.\n\nClick here if you would like to donate.\n\nNext court dates\n\nA probable cause conference for Chidester is scheduled for 9 a.m. April 30 at 9 a.m. It will be held virtually over Zoom.\n\nThe preliminary examination is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. May 6.

Yorkey.\n\nThe alleged drunk driver was charged with two counts of second-degree murder, two counts of \"Operating While Intoxicated Causing Death,\" and four counts of \"Operating While Intoxicated Causing Serious Injury.\"\n\n\"The Second Degree Murder charges carry a maximum of life imprisonment,\" Yorkey stated. \"Counts 3 and 4 each carry a maximum 15 Years imprisonment and/or $2500.00 - $10,000 and the remaining counts carry maximum sentences of up to 5 Years and/or $1,000 - $5,000.\"\n\nChildester's bond was set at $1,500,000, and she will require GPS tracking and an alcohol monitor if she can post bail.\n\nThe courtroom was somber and filled with tears from the victims' family during Childester's Tuesday arraignment.\n\n\"They walked into that birthday party having a fun time. They were sitting at that table, eating, and this woman crashed her car through this building, destroying all of our lives,\" the aunt of the two young siblings cried.\n\n\"I had to be the one to tell my sister her babies were gone,\" she said through tears. \"She said, 'How am I supposed to live without my babies?'\"\n\n\"My nephew and my sister are still fighting for their lives,\" she added.\n\nThe siblings' mother, identified as Mariah Dodds by the Detroit Free Press, is suing Chidester and the bar she had drank alcohol at earlier in the day, the outlet reported.\n\nPolice say that before the fatal crash, the accused drunk driver was a customer at Verna's Tavern, which Dodds has named as a defendant in the lawsuit she filed while still in the hospital.\n\n\"Can you imagine anything worse than that as a human being, as a parent?\" said Jon Marko, one of the grieving mother's attorneys.\n\n\"The surviving members of this family are going to carry this with them,\" he added. \"This has torn the entire family apart in the most unimaginable, painful way.\"\n\nAccording to her other attorney, Michael Jones, Dodds woke up in the hospital with a broken bone in her right shoulder, six broken ribs, severe pelvic bruising, stitched-up lips, and an eye swollen shut.\n\nWhen she could speak, the first thing she asked about was the condition of her children. This is when she found out the tragic news of Zayn and Alanah's deaths and that her eldest, J.P., was in the ICU with two broken legs, broken ribs, and a fractured skull.\n\nWhile Dodd's lawsuit argues that Verna's Tavern over-served a visibly intoxicated woman, both the family who owns the bar and Chidester's lawyer, Bill Colovos, said that she only had one glass of wine at the

The mother, Mariah Dobbs, and her son Jayden, who were also at the party, sustained severe injuries.\n\nFollowing this heartbreaking event, just two days later, a lawsuit was filed. It alleged that the bar where the suspect, Marshella Chidester, had been served had shown negligence by providing alcohol to a visibly intoxicated individual.\n\nAs reported by the Monroe County Sheriff's Office, the crash occurred at Swan Boat Club in Berlin Charter Township, south of Detroit, around 3 p.m. that Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe tragic event resulted in the loss of 8-year-old Alanah Phillips and her 4-year-old brother, Zayn Phillips. Additionally, Mariah Dobbs and her 11-year-old son suffered critical injuries in the accident. As legal proceedings unfolded, Marshella Chidester faced charges of second-degree murder, operating a vehicle while intoxicated causing death, and other related charges.\n\nFamily members of the victims expressed their anguish and loss during Chidester's arraignment with heart-wrenching statements and emotional pleas for justice. Chidester's attorney contended that she had consumed a minimal amount of alcohol hours before the incident and attributed the crash to a seizure that overwhelmed her while driving.\n\nDespite this defense, reports indicated that Chidester's blood alcohol level exceeded the legal limit, heightening concerns about the dangers posed by impaired driving.\n\nThe judge presiding over the case set her bond at $1.5 million, with the next court date scheduled for April 30.", "source": {"uri": "shorenewsnetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shore News Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Charter_Township,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berlin Charter Township, Michigan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Negligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_County,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monroe County, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monroe County, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blood alcohol content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Driving under the influence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/Reuters_Direct_Media/USOnlineReportDomesticNews/tagreuters.com2022binary_LYNXMPEI930UU-BASEIMAGE.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505569", "eventUri": "eng-9505569", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 1799, "textEnd": 1807}], "sentiment": -0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Marshella Chidester, 66, a former leader at the Swan Boat Club where the party occurred, has been charged with second-degree murder and other offenses in connection with the crash.\n\n\"We were supposed to be planning a birthday party for Zayn, not a funeral,\" said a distraught Smouthers, speaking at the Tuesday arraignment for Chidester in Monroe's 1st District Court before bond was set.\n\nTheir mother, Mariah Dodds, was also critically injured in the crash Saturday afternoon in Berlin Township, one of 13 hurt, as was her oldest son.\n\nSmouthers said she was the one who had to tell her sister after the crash that two of her three children had died.\n\n\"They walked into that birthday party having a fun time. They were sitting at that table, eating,\" she said. \"And this woman crashed her car through this building, destroying all of our lives.\"\n\nJon Marko, an attorney for Dodds, who has already filed a civil lawsuit against Chidester on Dodds' behalf, said her oldest son, J.P., remains in critical care after undergoing seven hours of \"excruciating\" surgery following the crash.\n\n\"Both of his legs were broken, ribs were broken and he suffered a fractured skull. His father remains by his side and is absolutely devastated by the loss,\" Marko said in a Tuesday press release.\n\nDodds, a Flat Rock resident, suffered a collapsed lung, six broken ribs, severe cuts, bruising and a knocked-out tooth, Mark said. In court, Smouthers said Dodds had been taken off a ventilator.\n\nMonroe County Undersheriff Joe Hammond said Tuesday afternoon that the 10 people confirmed injured on Monday, in addition to the two children killed, is still the most current information the agency has about the victims.\n\nHe clarified that a 66-year-old woman listed as injured by the sheriff's department is not Chidester, the driver now facing criminal charges for the crash.\n\nMatella Rodriguez, owner of Adelita's Mexican Cocina in Woodhaven, said Dodds had started working at the restaurant about three weeks ago. The restaurant is now donating 30% of its proceeds Tuesday and Thursday to her family.\n\n\"It's terrible what happened, and we wanted to help,\" Rodriguez said.\n\nAll three of Dodds' kids were students in Flat Rock Community Schools. Zayn was at the Early Childhood Center, while Lana was a second-grade student at Bobcean Elementary. Dodd's oldest, who is still recovering, attends Simpson Middle School.\n\nSuperintendent Andrew Brodie called the tragedy \"senseless\" in a letter to families Sunday and said extra counselors would be in place.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with the families impacted by this tragic and senseless incident,\" said Brodie in an email Tuesday. \"We cannot begin to fathom the pain and grief that they are experiencing, and we stand united in offering our support and condolences during this unimaginably difficult time.\"\n\nBrodie said counselors will be available to provide support and assistance to students and families for as long as they are needed \"surrounding this unspeakable tragedy.\"\n\nDan Clay of Northwood, Ohio, was the lone person on Tuesday at the makeshift memorial that has popped up outside the Swan Boat Club on Brancheau Street.\n\nHe brought flowers to the memorial, as Clay said he often does when he is near tragic events where children die. There were candles, balloons and stuffed animals.\n\n\"It's just so tragic, man, just so, so tragic,\" Clay said. \"That's what gets me is the kids.\"", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com",

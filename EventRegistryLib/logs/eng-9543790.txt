Hemant Soren chhootega (Hemant Soren will be released)!\" she sloganeers while the crowd chants after her.\n\nTwo months ago, on 4 March, Kalpana entered public life at the JMM's foundation day event in Giridih's Jhanda Ground, alongside Chief Minister Champai Soren. On stage with a microphone in hand, she couldn't hold back her tears.\n\n\"They (the BJP-led central government) hatched such a big conspiracy due to which Hemant had to go to jail. Jharkhand will not bow down. Jharkhand will not stop,\" she vowed.\n\nSince that emotional speech, the 38-year-old engineering and MBA graduate and mother of two has maintained her momentum, rallying JMM supporters and tribal groups in meeting after meeting. There's even speculation in political circles that she may become Jharkhand CM one day, especially after Gandey MLA Sarfraz Ahmed stepped aside for her candidacy from the seat, which comes under Giridih Lok Sabha constituency. Ahmed has since been elected to the Rajya Sabha.\n\n\"Kalpana Soren is an educated woman. The way she has presented herself among the family, JMM and India Block in a short span of time shows that she has emerged as an important face in JMM and the Soren family,\" said Rajat Kumar Gupta, a noted Jharkhand-based political analyst.\n\nOriginally from Mayurbhanj in Odisha, Kalpana Soren has seamlessly segued from her business and social work background into active politics in Jharkhand, according to Gupta.\n\n\"Through rallies and meetings, she seems to be trying to arouse the sentiments of the tribal community angry with the arrest of Hemant Soren,\" he said. \"She attacks the BJP and the central government, defends Hemant Soren, and shows respect for the status and movement (to create Jharkhand state) of Shibu Soren She pays homage to the tribal martyrs of Jharkhand.\"\n\nKalpana also presents a striking contrast to Sita Soren, her sister-in-law and the wife of the late Durga Soren. While Kalpana has dedicated herself to the JMM and the surviving Soren family, Sita took a different path, resigning as an MLA and joining the BJP in March. She is now contesting from the Dumka Lok Sabha constituency.\n\nAlso Read: Sita vs Kalpana -- Jharkhand is witnessing battle of Soren daughters-in-law this poll season\n\nKalpana Soren has been on a non-stop schedule, holding as many as 60 meetings in Gandey over the last week. She makes sure to greet everyone with a traditional 'johar', the traditional tribal equivalent of a namaskar.\n\n\"When Kalpana Soren raises both her hands and says 'johar' in any rally or meeting, the enthusiasm of the JMM cadre increases. She is not only awakening the cadre and supporters, but is also giving the call to move ahead for the struggle against the BJP and its government at the Centre,\" said Nunu Ram Kisku, the JMM's Bengabad block president.\n\nConnecting with crowds in both Santali and Hindi, and often seen donning tribal-style saris, she fires up support for the JMM and takes a combative stance against the BJP.\n\n\"The BJP thought that the field would be open for them after Hemant Soren's arrest, but Kalpana Soren has presented a big challenge to them,\" said JMM MLA Sudivya Kumar Sonu. \"Wherever she goes, she gets strong support from women of every section.\"\n\nKalpana also makes it a point to honour Jharkhand's tribal icons and warriors, incorporating their symbolism into her own image. For instance, in a 2 May post on X, she shared a photo of herself holding a bow and arrow, along with a poem by Ramdhari Singh Dinkar. \"When adversity strikes, it frightens only the coward. Warriors do not get perturbed,\" it says.\n\nOver the past two months, Kalpana has shared the stage with senior leaders three times at INDIA bloc rallies and is said to play an important role in collaborating with other members of the alliance.\n\nAt a 21 April rally in Ranchi, she sat beside Sunita Kejriwal, wife of jailed Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. Two empty chairs in the name of Hemant Soren and Arvind Kejriwal made a powerful point, registering the absence of their respective husbands.\n\nAfter filing her nomination for the Gandey by-election on 29 April, Kalpana delivered a speech at Papparwatand ground in front of Shibu Soren, her brother-in-law Basant Soren, and several leaders of the INDIA bloc.\n\n\"Hemant Soren has been put in jail, but the prison walls cannot imprison his thoughts. The blood of our revered Dishom Guruji flows through his son. How can anyone stop a man with tribal DNA?\" Kalpana declared. Her words stirred the crowd into chanting slogans in support of Hemant Soren.\n\nSide by side with her newfound 'warrior' image, Kalpana Soren talks about the Constitution, reservation, and tribal issues, while also trying to connect with constituents on a personal basis.\n\nFrom holding choupals under trees in villages to seeking blessings from elders to sipping tea at a tapri (roadside stall) with her supporters, she is cultivating the image of a grounded, people's leader.\n\nIn street meetings where she discusses the JMM government's schemes, she acknowledges that more work is needed to meet the people's aspirations.\n\n\"Kalpana Soren is energetic and likes to communicate with people in a very simple way. She also keeps an eye on people's problems and the pace of the schemes,\" said JMM spokesperson Dr Tanuj Khatri, who is associated with her campaign team. \"During meetings, she notes down the comments of workers and supporters on paper. She takes full care of how her words reach the hearts of the people.\"\n\nThe effectiveness of her strategies will be tested in the Gandey bypoll, where she squares off against BJP's Dilip Kumar Verma. The results are due on 4 June, alongside those of the Lok Sabha elections.", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "niraj_sinha@theprint.in",

Political debut linked to husband's arrest. Sister-in-law's BJP switch caused family rift. Campaign focuses on Hemant Soren's welfare schemes and family's loyalty.\"I do not want to be Jharkhand chief minister and there is no possibility of a change in the top job,\" Kalpana Soren, wife of former chief minister Hemant Soren, told ET, brushing aside suggestions that she plans to take over the top role if she wins the Gandey assembly by-election.\n\n\"No, I do not want to be the chief minister after winning the byelection from Gandey. These are rumours and I don't understand why people are spreading them,\" Kalpana told ET in an exclusive interview at her sprawling home near CM Champai Soren's official residence in the state capital. \"People should not link this byelection to the CM's position. Hemant Sorenji has given the legacy to Champai Sorenji. There is no possibility of change in this position,\" she said.\n\nThe 48-year-old homemaker took a plunge in politics after the arrest of her husband on January 31 by the ED in a land case.\n\nThis decision ruffled feathers within the family with her sister-in-law Sita Soren quitting Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and joining BJP. She is now a BJP candidate from Dumka. Some senior JMM leaders also expressed their displeasure over any possibility of Kalpana being made the CM.Speaking for the first time about her political debut, Kalpana said, \"It was my birthday on March 3 and I went to meet him (Soren) in jail. That day my husband said, 'Ab aapko morcha sambhaalna hai chaaron taraf ka.' I got the blessings from my in-laws. March 4 was foundation day of JMM and the party completed 51 years of formation. I took that opportunity to take the blessings of the people.\"\n\n\"What was very hurtful was the way he was arrested. He went to Raj Bhawan to give his resignation letter and a support letter. There was a large crowd of people waiting in front. We expected that he would be brought home and arrested from here. But ED officials did not even wait and took him out from the back door of Raj Bhawan. It was very embarrassing. These are official teams of an investigative agency - if you are coming into our homes and offices from the front gate, you should leave from the front gate.\"Kalpana said she is surprised with the reception she gets as she campaigns in Gandey.\n\nThe party is facing the tough challenge of campaigning without their star campaigner in the Lok Sabha elections being held in four phases from May 13 to June 1 in Jharkhand. The shock within the family and JMM is evident. However, on the ground, it seems the party has been unable to translate Soren's arrest into an emotive issue. Point this out to Kalpana and she rejects this. \"Tribals are very shy. We tribals do not show our emotions through our words or actions. You should have seen the huge crowd on April 21 in our rally. They came only for Hemantji and to protest against the arrest,\" she said.\n\nKalpana's political outings have been confident, drawing praise from INDIA bloc leaders, including Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi.\n\nWhile JMM is trying to make Soren's arrest as the main electoral issue, Kalpana said she is talking about her husband's welfare schemes, including Sarvjan Pension scheme and Abua Awas Yojana. Her home bears all signs of being the party's war room. The living room still has a sofa where Hemant Soren used to sit. That place is never taken by her or anyone from the family, aides said.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gandey"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalpana_(Malayalam_actress)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kalpana (Malayalam actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/By-election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "By-election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jharkhand"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jharkhand"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand_Mukti_Morcha", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jharkhand Mukti Morcha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemant_Soren", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hemant Soren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champai_Soren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Champai Soren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sita_Soren", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sita Soren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumka_district", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dumka district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priyanka_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Priyanka Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adivasi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adivasi"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-109989099,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-48786,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543790", "eventUri": "eng-9543790", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-13", "dateEnd": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 2541, "textEnd": 2557}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-31", "textStart": 1082, "textEnd": 1092}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-03", "textStart": 1490, "textEnd": 1497}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-04", "textStart": 1652, "textEnd": 1659}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-21", "textStart": 2906, "textEnd": 2914}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

I always say that the DNA of the tribal is such that it cannot accept bowing down before anyone. So when Baba Tilka Manjhi did not bow down, Guruji did not and Hemant ji did not bow down, then I always felt that an attempt was being made to suppress the tribals. But I know that Adivasi is a seed on which no matter how much soil you put on it, it will emerge as a plant and when it bears fruit, it will give more seeds.\n\nAs far as tribal leadership in the country is concerned, the time will soon come when the country will get some tribal leadership.", "source": {"uri": "sabrangindia.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "SabrangIndia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemant_Soren", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hemant Soren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giridih_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Giridih district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Giridih district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand_Mukti_Morcha", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jharkhand Mukti Morcha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adivasi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adivasi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odia_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Odia language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Partition of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_and_arrow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bow and arrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hindi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bengali language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birsa_Munda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birsa Munda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Raj"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sabrangindia.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/soren.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543790", "eventUri": "eng-9543790", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Giridih district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-04", "textStart": 355, "textEnd": 362}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 479, "textEnd": 484}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The leaders addressing the rally repeatedly said that Hemant Soren is being implicated because they are tribals. Marnadi said that however, the reality is that during his tenure, Hemant Soren worked to completely tarnish the honor and dignity of the tribals. The identity of the tribals is that they are easy going and simple. He has no connection whatsoever with the irregularities, but in the last 4 years of being in power, Hemant Soren has committed fraud, looted natural resources or mineral wealth, himself has been involved in loot and under his protection there are middlemen, brokers. They did not leave coal, iron, sand or even service land. Tribal land was also looted by making fake documents.\n\nHe said that a mountain of Rs 350 crore notes was seized from the Rajya Sabha member of Congress. The world saw that too. The counting of notes found here did not end in one day, it continued for several days. Man and even machine got tired. If proper investigation is done, the involvement of the present or former Chief Minister in the money will also be seen.\n\nToday cash worth more than Rs 25 crore were also found at the hideouts of corrupt officers, brokers and middlemen in Jharkhand. Even today crores of rupees have been found in the house of Alamgir Alam's PS servant. Indi alliance leader Rahul Gandhi should tell whose money this is.\n\nHe said that if such a huge amount of money has been found in the house of a servant, then if the houses of his assistants, his secretaries or ministers, brokers and middlemen associated with the government are also raided, then I don't know how many crores of rupees will be found. This cannot even be imagined. The people of the Indi Coalition are completely disappointed. They want to win the elections on the strength of money. The Jharkhand government is completely involved in corruption. Former Chief Minister taking mineral leases in his own name, taking land in an industrial area in the name of his wife, taking mining lease in the name of brother in Pakur district, taking mining lease in the name of press advisor, taking mining lease in the name of family.\n\nHe said that the broker-engineer among them is also in jail. If the money received today or Rs 350 crore is investigated, its telegram will also reach the prince of Congress. The extortion business continued in the state for the last 4 years. The leaders here go around saying that Hemant Soren was implicated. Kalpana Soren says that the husband was framed. What could be a bigger proof than the fact that such a huge wad of currency notes amounting to Rs 350 crore was found at the residence of a Congress leader. Already Rs 20 crore is received from the offices of one IAS. Today money has been found from the house of the servant of the personal secretary of the Congress Party minister.\n\nHe said that the Chief Secretary had written a letter to the Rural Development Secretary and all those letters were found along with the bundle of notes. He said that Chief Minister Chapai Soren should file an FIR immediately on the basis of the letter. Get the entire matter investigated by CBI. Recommend it. It should not happen that he also spends his old age in jail.\n\nMedia in-charge Shivpujan Pathak, co-media in-charge Ashok Badaik, co-media in-charge Yogendra Pratap were also present.", "source": {"uri": "dailypioneer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Pioneer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemant_Soren", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hemant Soren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adivasi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adivasi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babulal_Marandi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Babulal Marandi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mineral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jharkhand"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jharkhand"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alamgir_Alam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alamgir Alam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_information_report", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First information report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakur_district", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakur district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Administrative_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Administrative Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543790", "eventUri": "eng-9543790", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Meta loses $200 billion in value as Zuckerberg focuses earnings call on all the ways company bleeds cash.\n\nMark Zuckerberg started Meta's earnings call by talking about AI (artificial intelligence). He also talked about metaverse, touting his company's headsets, glasses and operating system. Meta AI expenses is almost the entirety of Zuckerberg's opening remarks focused on the many ways the company loses money.\n\nMeta stock fall\n\nInvestors weren't into it. Meta shares price tumbled as much as 19% in extended trading on Wednesday, wiping out more than $200 billion in market cap. The fall in Meta stock 0came despite Meta reporting better-than-expected profit and revenue for the first quarter.\n\nThis was Meta shares' second highest one-day loss in stock value after the $232 billion loss suffered on February 3, 2022, which was the record one-day loss of market capitalization for any U.S. company.\n\nZuckerberg appeared ready for the sell-off.\n\n\"I think it's worth calling that out, that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it,\" Zuckerberg said. He cited past efforts like short-video service Reels, Stories and the transition to mobile.\n\nMeta revenue\n\nThe Facebook and Instagram parent Meta expects its April-June revenue in the range of $36.5 billion-$39 billion, with a midpoint of $37.8 billion, lower than analysts' estimates of $38.3 billion, according to LSEG data, Reuters reported.\n\nMeta raised its forecast for expenses this year to support investments in new AI products and the computing infrastructure needed to support them. The company said that the expected spending would continue to increase next year.\n\nMeta raised its 2024 total expense forecast to $96 billion - $99 billion, from $94 billion - $99 billion. It also expects 2024 capital expenditure to fall within a range of $30 billion - $40 billion, up from its earlier forecast of $35 billion - $37 billion, the Reuters report said.\n\nMeta digital advertising\n\nMeta generates 98% of its revenue from digital advertising. But to the extent Zuckerberg talked about ads, he was looking to the future and the ways the company could potentially turn its current investments into ad dollars. In discussing Meta's effort to build a \"leading AI,\" by scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions.\n\nMeta's Reality Labs unit, which houses the company's hardware and software for development of the nascent metaverse, continues to bleed cash. Reality Labs reported sales of $440 million for the first quarter and $3.85 billion in losses. The division's cumulative losses since the end of 2020 have topped $45 billion.\n\nMeta's stock price almost tripled last year and, as of Wednesday's close, was up 40% in 2024. It reached a record $527.34 in early April.\n\nAfter a brutal 2022, during which the company lost about two-thirds of its value, Zuckerberg appears to have regained the confidence of Wall Street.\n\nMeta financial outlook\n\nThe driver for the rally has been a cost-cutting plan that the Meta CEO put in place early last year. On Wednesday, Zuckerberg said that Meta will continue to operate efficiently, but that shifting existing resources to investments in AI will \"grow our investment envelope meaningfully.\"\n\nZuckerberg said he expects to see a \"multiyear investment cycle\" before Meta's AI products will scale into profitable services, but noted that the company has a \"strong track record\" in that department.\n\nMeta finance chief Susan Li echoed Zuckerberg's remarks, saying the company needs to develop advanced models and scale products before they will drive meaningful revenue.\n\nEven before the call began, investors were trimming their holdings. That's because Meta issued a light revenue forecast for the second quarter, overshadowing the first-quarter beat.\n\nAs Meta stock fall intensified, Zuckerberg told investors that if they're willing to come along for the ride, they may well be rewarded.", "source": {"uri": "industryleadersmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Industry Leaders Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mia_garcia@industryleadersmagazine.com", "name": "Mia Garcia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality headset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://www.industryleadersmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Meta-Stock-Fall-Loses-200B-with-Lower-Revenue-and-High-AI-Spent.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

And the initial signs are quite positive here too,\" he said. \"But building the leading AI will also be a larger undertaking than the other experiences we've added to our apps and this is likely going to take several years on the upside once our new AI services reach scale.\"\n\nIn the lead up to the first-quarter results, Meta launched its latest version of its chatbot, Llama 3, which will power the company's new AI assistant, Meta AI.\n\nZuckerberg said that the AI assistant will be integrated into many of Meta's products, including Instagram and Facebook.\n\nMeta said that Llama 3 is the \"most capable\" open source model out there, but as Business Insider's Hasan Chowdhury reported, the tool has yet to beat ChatGPT 4, OpenAI's language model that was released last year.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lloyd_lee@businessinsider.com", "name": "Lloyd Lee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terms of service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open source model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/66298ac210dfcda409631adb?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

We saw this with Reels, Stories, as Newsfeed transitioned to mobile, and more,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nBut he also admitted that it will likely take years before Meta turns a profit on its AI investments. In January, Zuckerberg announced via an Instagram post that Meta will purchase some 350,000 Nvidia H100 AI chips by the end of the year. While Nvidia doesn't release the exact price of its data center chips, estimates indicate they cost anywhere between $20,000 and $40,000 apiece. That would put Meta's estimated costs well into the billions of dollars.\n\nMeta CFO Susan Li backed up Zuckerberg's statements in her earnings note commentary, raising the company's full-year total expenses estimate from a range of between $94 billion and $99 billion to between $96 billion and $99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs. Li said that the company's investments will also increase in the years ahead.\n\n\"While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts,\" Li said.\n\nWhile Wall Street's early reaction to Zuckerberg's comments may have turned off some investors, experts say the investments will likely pay off in the long run more than, say, the company's metaverse play.\n\n\"There's no doubt that Meta is all in on AI but to achieve its vision, the company must make big investments in infrastructure. Mark Zuckerberg's 'heads up' was reminiscent of what he once said about the metaverse,\" Forrester vice president and research director Mike Proulx said in a statement.\n\n\"That didn't exactly go so well, but this is different than Meta's metaverse gamble because AI has real and practical use cases now. The question remains whether Meta can contend in the AI race while maintaining a strong financial position,\" he added.\n\nWilliam Blair analyst Ralph Schackart, meanwhile, said that while the timing and scale of Meta's generative AI investments will be larger and longer than its prior build-outs, making moves now will put Meta in a more competitive position against rivals.\n\n\"We believe [Meta] is still exercising prudence in spending and ultimately will be one of the leaders in the AI race. However, this may take some time and further proof points to investors,\" he wrote in an investor note.\n\nMeta's AI investments include two divisions, one dedicated to consumer users and the other focusing on advertisers. On the consumer front, there's the company's new Meta AI chatbot which answers users' general knowledge questions. Then there's Meta AI's customer side, which allows advertisers to build out advertising campaigns on the company's social platforms using AI.\n\nAll of the focus on Meta's AI investments, however, overshadowed the fact that the company still beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines for the quarter, posting earnings per share (EPS) of $4.71 in the quarter on revenue of $36.46 billion. Analysts were anticipating EPS of $4.30 on revenue of $36.12 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe company did, however, say it anticipates Q2 revenue slightly off the midpoint of what Wall Street was expecting. Meta said it will see second quarter revenue between $36.5 billion and $39 billion; estimates called for $38.24 billion.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Zuckerberg emphasizes long-term investments and positive Meta AI feedback. Social media giant Meta reported a surge in profit with the Facebook and Instagram parent seeing its first-quarter profit more than double, boosted by higher advertising revenue and a 6% increase in the average price of ads on its platforms, to touch $12.37 billion from $5.71 billion during the same period last year.\n\nRevenue, too, rose 27% to $36.46 billion from $28.65 billion. However, despite beating analyst estimates the stock slumped over 15% in extended trade after the company forecasted higher expenses.\n\nThe company said it expects second-quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $36.5-39 billion and projected expenses in the range of $35-40 billion, compared to its earlier guidance of $30-37 billion.\n\nAdditionally, Meta said it expects full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-99 billion, updated from its prior outlook of $94-99 billion, due to higher infrastructure and legal costs.\n\nAfter what Zuckerberg termed the 'year of efficiency' in 2023, where large scale layoffs took place, the company's projected costs and expenses for the future did not inspire confidence among investors.\n\n\"Historically, investing to build new scaled experiences in our apps has been a very good long-term investment for us and for investors who have stuck with us and the initial signs are quite positive here too.

He said the feedback was very positive and that the company started by launching Meta AI in some English speaking countries and will soon roll it out in more languages and countries over the coming months.\n\n\"We believe that Meta AI with Llama 3 is now the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use and now that we have the superior quality product, we are making it easier for lots of people to use it within WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram and Facebook,\" he said.\n\nMeta has been a leader in the AI race competing alongside Google and OpenAI. Besides these giants, there are also start-ups like Anthropic, Cohere and Mistral which have been releasing new AI language models.\n\nOn the app front, Meta reported a 7% spike the number of users across its apps in the quarter with an average of 3.24 billion users in March across its \"family of apps\" -- Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. The company also said that it will no longer disclose user figures specifically for Facebook.\n\nAd impressions delivered across Meta's family of apps also increased by 20% year-over-year and the average price per ad went up 6% year-over-year.\n\nFurther, Meta said its workforce decreased by 10% YoY, in line with the company's move for a 'year of efficiency.'

He believes that artificial intelligence will fundamentally change the relationship between humans and computers.\n\nFollowing the release of its latest LLM Llama 3, Meta plans to invest heavily in even more advanced AI models and services in the coming years, with the goal of developing the world's largest and most powerful AI services.\n\nMeta is forging ahead with the development of its AI technologies and services. During the company's most recent quarterly earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Meta is working on a variety of different AI services, including Meta AI, an AI assistant that can answer questions across all Meta apps and glasses.\n\nMeta recently released a new version of the assistant based on its latest language model, Llama 3. The rollout is going well, and tens of millions of people have already tried the service, according to Zuckerberg, who said Meta AI is the smartest free AI assistant today. With RayBan's Meta smart glasses, people in the U.S. and Canada can use Meta's multimodal AI assistant for everyday tasks.\n\nAlong with the new Meta AI, the company also introduced deeper integration of generative AI into its apps in the U.S. and more than a dozen other countries. Users will be able to use Meta's AI assistant in search, news feed and groups on Facebook. The search integration in particular could strengthen Meta's position in the overall search market, though it still relies on Google and Bing.\n\nZuckerberg said he sees Meta's new 8- and 70-billion-parameter Lama models as best-in-class, and benchmarks seem to support that view. But only real-world applications will tell the whole truth. Meta is currently training a Lama 3 model with over 400 billion parameters, which \"seems on track to be industry-leading on several benchmarks,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nMeta's stated goal is to invest significantly more in the coming years to develop even more advanced models and the world's largest AI services.\n\nHowever, building a leading AI will be a \"larger undertaking than the other experiences we've added to our apps, and this is likely going to take several years,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nIn plain terms, this means Meta doesn't know when or how it will make money from generative AI. Zuckerberg is betting that open-sourcing the Llama models will reduce Meta's infrastructure and development costs eventually.\n\nOther monetization options Zuckerberg mentioned included scaling business messaging, introducing advertising or paid content into AI interactions, and letting users pay for the use of larger AI models and access to more computing power. AI also improves engagement in apps, which leads to us seeing more ads and improving ads directly to provide more value, he said.\n\nMeta's AI recommendation systems are also making progress. About 30 percent of posts in the Facebook feed and, for the first time, more than 50 percent of content on Instagram are now served by AI recommendation systems, the company said. Meta recently introduced a proprietary processor designed to make these systems run more efficiently.\n\nThe stock market reacted very critically to Meta's quarterly results and Zuckerberg's outlook, even though revenue grew more than 27 percent year over year to $36.5 billion. Meta's stock lost 15 percent in after-hours trading and continues to fall. However, the stock had risen excessively since the beginning of the year due to the AI hype.\n\nZuckerberg likely anticipated this reaction: During the conference call, he mentioned that \"it's worth calling out that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook - where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it.\"\n\nBut investor skepticism might be warranted. Before AI, Meta was riding high on the metaverse hype wave and has lost billions on the technology to date. The ten-year plans announced in the past should have generated significant revenues by now. Even Apple has yet to kickstart the VR and AR glasses market.\n\nThe future of generative AI seems equally uncertain when it comes to making money at scale. Meta's industry peers, such as Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google, are also currently losing billions on the technology, with no clear path to revenue growth other than perhaps boosting their own cloud business with startup investments.", "source": {"uri": "the-decoder.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "THE DECODER"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthias_bastian@the-decoder.com", "name": "Matthias Bastian", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recommender system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Open-source software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://the-decoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/meta_logo_neura_network.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Meta reported first quarter net income of $12.37 billion, or $4.71 a share, with revenue of $36.46 billion, up 27%. Meta said its second quarter revenue will be $36.5 billion to $39 billion. The real zinger was that Meta said its 2024 capital expenditures would be $35 billion to $40 billion, above previous guidance of $30 billion to $37 billion.\n\nNeedless to say, that capital expenditure guidance led to a bevy of analyst questions about Meta's AI strategy and potential. Zuckerberg was happy to elaborate. Here's what he had to say about Meta's AI buildout and the long-term view. The upshot is that Meta intends to be an AI leader.\n\nMeta AI as helper. Zuckerberg said Meta AI will be an assistant across the company's apps and glasses that will connect people via APIs for everything from commerce to customer support as well as coding and development. The initial rollout of Meta AI has had \"tens of millions of people\" trying it. \"We believe that Meta AI with Llama 3 is now the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use. And now that we have the superior quality product we are making it easier for lots of people to use them within WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram, and Facebook,\" said Zuckerberg.\n\nFurther model improvements. Meta has said it is working on a 400 billion parameter model that is still in training. \"I expect our models are just going to improve further from open-source contributions,\" he said. \"We have the talent, data and ability to scale infrastructure to build the world's leading AI models and services. And this leads me to believe that we should invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models and the largest scale AI services in the world,\" said Zuckerberg.\n\nThis AI investment isn't cheap. Zuckerberg said Meta will operate the rest of its business as efficiently as possible and will shift those savings to AI investments. Nevertheless, Meta is going to spend heavily. \"We will still grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products,\" he said.\n\nMeta CFO Susan Li said:\n\n\"As we develop more advanced and compute intensive recommendation models, and scale capacity for our generative AI training and inference needs, we expect that having sufficient infrastructure capacity will be critical to realizing many of these opportunities. As a result, we expect that we will invest significantly more in infrastructure over the coming years.\"\n\nInvestors aren't going to like the AI investment, but Meta is used to it. The company has \"historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook, where we're investing in scaling and new products but aren't yet monetizing it,\" said Zuckerberg. It has happened before with Reels, news feed and the transition to mobile. APIs are likely to be a profitable AI service for Meta. \"Building a leading AI will also be a larger undertaking than the other experiences we've added to our apps, and this is likely going to take several years,\" he added.\n\nThe payoff is there. Zuckerberg said:\n\n\"Once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively. There are several ways to build a massive business here, including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions. And enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute. And on top of that. AI is already helping us improve app engagement which naturally leads to seeing more ads and improving ads directly to deliver more value.\"\n\nZuckerberg said that 30% of the posts on Facebook's feed are served by AI and 50% of Instagram content is AI recommended.\n\nThe cost efficiency of model training will be a priority. Zuckerberg said open-source contributions will likely enable efficiency gains as will Meta's proprietary accelerator chips. The goal is to run AI workloads on a less expensive stack.\n\nThere's an AI and augmented reality intersection. \"Glasses are the ideal device for an AI assistant because you can let them see what you see and hear what you hear. So, they have full context on what's going on around you, as they help you with whatever you're trying to do,\" said Zuckerberg.\n\nAnd the time is now. Zuckerberg said:\n\n\"With the latest models, we're not just building good AI models that are that are going to be capable of building some new goods, social and commerce products. I actually think we're at a place where we've shown that we can build leading models and be the leading AI company in the world, and that opens up a lot of additional opportunities.\"\n\nThe future.

Investors had been expecting $475 million, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe unit's sales leaped 30 per cent from the year prior, but were still below the average revenue of $523 million posted in previous first-quarter reports since Meta started disclosing Reality Labs revenue in 2021.\n\nReality Labs lost $3.8 billion in the quarter, putting it on track this year to match the $16 billion it lost over the course of 2023.\n\nZuckerberg also described potential monetization plans for Meta's AI chatbot, such as using it for business messaging and customer support.\n\nMeta theoretically stands to benefit from regulatory pressures bearing down on its Chinese-owned short video competitor TikTok, which is facing the threat of a U.S. ban, although Meta CFO Susan Li told investors she was not yet ready to assess the business impact of the potential setback for its rival.\n\nMeta posted first-quarter revenue of $36.5 billion, roughly in line with expectations of $36.2 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nMeta's daily active people (DAP), a metric it uses to track unique users of any one of its apps Facebook, Instagram, Messenger or WhatsApp in a day, grew 7 per cent.\n\nDAP grew 8 per cent in the preceding quarter.\n\nMeta disclosed only the DAP figure for user growth, a first for the company. It said earlier this year that it would no longer break out numbers for flagship social network Facebook, whose growth has slowed in recent years.", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital expenditure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Action_Party_(Malaysia)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Action Party (Malaysia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_analyst", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial analyst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--ynjMGmYz--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/one-cms/core/2024-04-24t201024z_1_lynxnpek3n0v8_rtroptp_3_meta-platforms-artificial-intelligence.jpg?itok=Rw8ZHLg1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

This was despite Meta posting another stunning set of financial results.\n\nFirst quarter financials\n\nFor the first quarter ending 31 March 2024, Meta posted a net profit up 117 percent at $12.4 billion, from $5.7bn in the same year-ago quarter.\n\nRevenues rose 27 percent $36.5bn from $28.6bn a year earlier. Meta generates 98 percent of its revenue from digital advertising.\n\n\"It's been a good start to the year,\" said Mark Zuckerberg. \"The new version of Meta AI with Llama 3 is another step towards building the world's leading AI. We're seeing healthy growth across our apps and we continue making steady progress building the metaverse as well.\"\n\nIndeed, it continues a remarkable transformation in Meta's financial performance after a brutal 2022, during which the company lost about two-thirds of its value.\n\nZuckerberg began 2023 with a 'year of efficiency' pledge after he had displeased Wall Street with the scale of heavy spending on the Metaverse.\n\nDuring 2023 Meta repeatedly slashed its workforce numbers (approximately 21,000 staff) as well as other operating expenses. This aggressive cost cutting saw Meta's stock price almost triple in value last year, and propelled Meta's market cap well past $1 trillion.\n\nMeta's workforce now stands at 69,329 as of 31 March 2024, a decrease of 10 percent year-over-year.\n\nMeta no longer reports key metrics such as its daily active users and monthly active users.\n\nRead also : Tesla Posts Biggest Revenue Drop Since 2012\n\nInstead it now provides a figure for what it calls \"family daily active people\" or DAP. That number was 3.24 billion for March 2024, a 7 percent increase from a year earlier.\n\nAI spending\n\nIn its financial results, Meta made clear it will be spending heavily on AI.\n\n\"We anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35-40 billion, increased from our prior range of $30-37 billion as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap,\" the firm stated.\n\n\"While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts,\" it added.\n\nMeta's Zuckerberg had been criticised in January over for saying he intends for the company to build artificial general intelligence (AI) systems and make them \"widely available\" to the public.\n\n\"Our long-term vision is to build general intelligence, open source it responsibly, and make it widely available so everyone can benefit,\" Zuckerberg had said in a post on Instagram.\n\nAn industry observer, David Thiel, a data architect and chief scientist of the Stanford Internet Observatory, had called Meta's AI plans \"vaporous\", while a member of the UN's AI body had said the idea of making such powerful tools widely available was \"irresponsible\".\n\nBut on Wednesday Zuckerberg in a conference call added to investor concern about Meta's AI spending, after he said investments in artificial intelligence were increasing.\n\n\"On the upside, once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively,\" Zuckerberg was quoted by CNBC as saying.\n\nZuckerberg then discussed the Metaverse, touting his company's headsets, glasses and operating system, which are not making money yet.\n\nRead also : UK CMA Seeks Feedback On Microsoft, Amazon AI Partnerships", "source": {"uri": "silicon.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Silicon UK"},

Total expenses reached $22.6 billion, a 6% increase.\n\n\"It's been a good start to the year -- both in terms of product momentum and business performance,\" said CEO mark Zuckerberg in the earnings call.\n\nTwo key factors of the report appear to have worried investors, causing shares to plunge 15% in after-hours trading.\n\nFirstly, a weaker-than-expected Q2 revenue. Meta's second-quarter revenue guidance fell short of analysts' forecasts. The company expects overall sales to be between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, with the mid-point missing the estimated $38.2 billion. This cautious outlook has raised concerns about Meta's ability to sustain its impressive performance so far.\n\nSecondly, Meta have announced an increase in AI spending, including AI training and high-computing chips in its data centres. Its capital expenditures for full-year 2024 are now projected to range from $35 billion to $40 billion, up from the previous estimate of $30 billion to $37 billion.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg said this was so Meta can \"continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap\". While not providing expenditure guidance beyond this year, Zuckerberg noted that it is expected to increase as the company is set to \"invest aggressively\" in AI R&D to compete with rivals such as OpenAI and Microsoft.\n\nLast week, Meta released the latest version of Meta AI, which is powered by its latest model, Llama 3. In the earnings call, Zuckerberg confirmed that the \"goal with Meta AI is to build the world's leading AI service both in quality and usage.\" The company believes that Meta AI is the most intelligent free AI assistant.\n\nKeep up to date with the latest international telecoms news by subscribing to the Total Telecom daily newsletter\n\nAlso in the news:\n\nSouth Korea to invest $7 billion in AI semiconductors\n\nSwisscom expands 5G partnership with Ericsson\n\nDaisy Group set to acquire 4Com for \u00a3215m", "source": {"uri": "totaltele.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Telecom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "georgia_sweeting@totaltele.com", "name": "Georgia Sweeting", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swisscom", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swisscom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ericsson", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ericsson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Venture_Capital", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Venture Capital", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://totaltele.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mr26tqghgmc-768x512.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

As of 10:52 a.m. ET, the stock was still down 12.3%.\n\nThe catalyst that sent the social media titan lower was the company's quarterly financial report, but not for the reasons you might think.\n\nIn the first quarter, Meta reported revenue that grew 27% year over year to $36.4 billion. Expenses grew more slowly, increasing just 6%, which helped drive operating margins to 38%, up from 25% in the prior-year quarter. This fueled robust profits, as earnings per share (EPS) surged 114% to $4.71.\n\nTo put the results into context, analysts' consensus estimates called for revenue of $36.14 billion and EPS of $4.32, so Meta sailed past expectations with ease.\n\nMeta also noted that the number of users of its family of social media sites grew 7% year over year to 3.24 billion, while advertising impressions across its family of apps jumped 20%.\n\nThat mostly sounds like a cause for celebration, so what caused the stock to plummet? Meta's plans for artificial intelligence (AI) and the associated spending. Meta raised its full-year forecast for capital expenditures to a range of $35 billion to $40 billion, up from its prior outlook of $30 billion to $37 billion. Meta said, \"We continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap.\" It also said capital spending to support AI will be even higher in 2025.\n\nSince generative AI burst on the scene last year, the demand to incorporate these advanced algorithms has been off the charts. Meta is one of just a few big tech companies with the resources to create the large language models needed to bring generative AI to life.\n\nThe company's Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) AI is widely regarded as being among the top AI systems in the world, though CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged, \"We're investing and scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it.\"\n\nWhile many analysts (slightly) reduced their price targets on Meta stock, sentiment was surprisingly upbeat. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill seemed to capture the prevailing mood on Wall Street, saying that investors should \"buy the [Zuckerberg] shopping cart dip.\"\n\nWith Meta stock selling for just 22 times forward earnings, he's not wrong.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danny_vena@fool.com", "name": "Danny Vena", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLaMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LLaMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/774334/tween-filming-friends-with-smart-phone.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Last year capital expenditure spending totalled $28.1 billion.\n\nIt added it expected capital expenditures to continue to rise next year, and also raised the lower range of its 2024 full-year expenses guidance, from $94 billion to $96 billion. It has forecast revenues for the current quarter in the range of $36.5 billion-$39 billion, versus consensus estimates of $38.3 billion.\n\nLast year, the chief executive of Meta sought to keep Wall Street happy against a backdrop of tough macroeconomic conditions, slashing jobs, cutting costs and labelling 2023 a \"year of efficiency\".\n\nHowever, Mr Zuckerberg is increasingly under pressure to keep pace in the fast-moving AI race with Silicon Valley groups such as OpenAI, Microsoft and Alphabet's Google, which has forced him to boost investment in the costly technology and infrastructure required to support his plans. Microsoft and Alphabet are expected to deliver updates on their own AI efforts in earnings reports on Thursday.\n\nmr Zuckerberg said on a call with analysts that he believed Meta \"should invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models and the largest scale AI services in the world\". This spending would have to grow \"meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products\", he added.\n\nThe after-hours fall in Meta's shares wiped billions of dollars off its market value. It is a sharp reversal for a stock that had risen more than 40 per cent this year, having been in record territory since a bumper fourth-quarter earnings announcement in February during which it announced its first dividend and signalled a strong recovery from a recent advertising slump.\n\nAs part of its efforts to develop and integrate AI tools into its products, Meta has focused on introducing chatbots to its social media apps to boost engagement, as well as features for advertisers, and improving the targeting of its feeds.\n\nThis month it released a new version of the AI model behind its chatbots, Llama 3, which it said had vastly improved capabilities, including the ability to reason. Meta also unveiled a new generation of its AI custom-made chips.\n\nIn his opening remarks to investors on Wednesday's earnings call, during which the shares continued to slide, Mr Zuckerberg attempted to assuage investor fears over the spending by pointing to the company's \"strong track record\" of monetisation.\n\nTo bring in revenue, Meta could scale business messaging, introduce advertising into user interactions with AI chatbots, and charge groups to use its bigger AI models, he said.\n\nmr Zuckerberg also said Meta would continue to invest in his longer-term ambitions to build an avatar-filled metaverse, focusing on developing what he dubbed \"wearable AI\" -- smart glasses with an embedded AI assistant.\n\nReality Labs, Meta's virtual and augmented reality arm, posted losses of $3.85 billion in the first quarter, about the same as the previous year, with the company adding it continued to expect operating losses to \"increase meaningfully\" year-over-year.\n\n\"Mark Zuckerberg's 'heads-up' was reminiscent of what he once said about the metaverse. That didn't exactly go so well, but this is different than Meta's metaverse gamble because AI has real and practical use cases now,\" said Forrester research director Mike Proulx.\n\n\"The question remains whether Meta can contend in the AI race while maintaining a strong financial position. To do this, expect to see more 'metaverse' resources diverted from Reality Labs to Meta's AI initiatives,\" he added. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2024", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reality Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smartglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrester_Research", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forrester Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Augmented reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/Y2hHMcBMoS539p2wubbbONrJMxg=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/U4KB52MECLDJVJVOE3N66TOKSQ.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

However, its shares plunged 15% due to weaker-than-expected second-quarter revenue guidance and an increased spending plan for artificial intelligence.\n\nThe parent company of Facebook, Meta Platforms, has reported first-quarter earnings that significantly exceeded market expectations. However, shares of the social media giant dropped approximately 15% in after-hours trading due to weaker-than-expected sales revenue guidance and higher-than-anticipated expenses for the current quarter. This has raised concerns about whether the ongoing performance of the tech giant can justify its 39% year-to-date rally.\n\nMeta stands as the second-best performer among US big tech companies on Wall Street this year, trailing only Nvidia. However, today's decline has the potential to erase approximately $200 billion from the company's market capitalisation. Despite this setback, its shares are still expected to post a year-to-date gain of 20% after the drop.\n\nMeta reported earnings per share of $4.71 on an overall sales revenue of $36.46 billion, topping the estimated $4.32 and $36.1 billion, respectively. Its revenue represents a 27% increase from the same quarter in 2023, with net income more than doubling from last year. The company's advertising income remains a primary driver for sales, experiencing a 27% growth to $35.64 billion, constituting 98% of its total revenue. Meta benefited from the advertising efforts of Chinese overseas online retailers such as Temu and Shein over the past two quarters.\n\nAt the same time, its Metaverse division, Reality Labs, comprising VR headsets and Ray-Ban smart glasses, continued to run at a loss of $3.85 billion. Notably, Meta stopped providing daily and monthly active users for separate family apps. Instead, it started a new combined metric of 'family daily active people' (DAP), which increased by 7% year-over-year to $3.24 billion for March 2024.\n\nMeta provided a weaker-than-expected second-quarter revenue guidance, expecting the overall sales to be between $36.5 and $39 billion. Its mid-point falls short of analysts' forecast of $38.2 billion. The company plans to spend more on AI-related projects, such as AI training, and high computing chips in its data centre, anticipating that full-year 2024 capital expenditures will range from $35 billion to $40 billion, increased from the prior estimate of between $30 billion and $37 billion. Meta also highlighted that the regulatory landscape may \"significantly\" impact its financial results.\n\nIt appears that CEO Mark Zuckerberg has resumed his ambitious spending strategy, with a renewed focus on AI development. This comes two years after the company embarked on its ambitious Metaverse vision, which has incurred losses of over $45 billion since 2020. At the earnings press conference, Zuckerberg said: \"We've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it.\" He discussed plans to invest more in AI chatbot training, such as the large language model software Llama 3, aiming to compete with Microsoft's ChatGPT and Alphabet's Burd. Recently, Meta launched its Meta AI platform across its social apps, including Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger. This move is viewed as a significant milestone in Meta's endeavour to establish a foothold in the AI race, spearheaded by Microsoft in February 2023.\n\nOnly three days before its earnings report, Meta announced it would offer the operation system (OS) for its AR headsets and partner with hardware companies, such as Microsoft, Lenovo, and Ausus. The move is seen as a major step to compete with Apple's iOS and the mixed reality headset, which is a much more costly hardware.\n\nMeta weathered a rocky period in 2022 due to its reckless spending on Metaverse and macro headwinds. The company made a turnaround in 2023, embracing the slogan \"a year of efficiency\", through layoffs and other cost-saving measures. In the final quarter of 2023, Meta offered the first-ever dividend to shareholders and announced a $50 billion stock buyback program. Adding to the momentum, Meta's AI advance has boosted its share price by about 137% from a year ago. Meta's stocks posted a whopping increase of 470% from its historical low in November 2022.\n\nMeta's intention to embark on an increasing spending spree in the AI domain raises questions about whether the company has reached another pinnacle of growth. This concern extends beyond Meta alone and encompasses other major tech firms as well.\n\nToday's later earnings releases from Microsoft and Alphabet will provide further insights into the trajectory of the burgeoning AI industry. These updates will shed light on how other tech giants are navigating the competitive landscape and positioning themselves for future growth in the realm of artificial intelligence.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality headset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_users", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Active users"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray-Ban", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ray-Ban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shopping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online shopping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/39/72/02/1200x675_cmsv2_bb1ab3a4-59e9-58d4-aef2-a4157fd391ae-8397202.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Investors had been expecting $475 million, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe unit's sales leaped 30% from the year prior, but were still below the average revenue of $523 million posted in previous first-quarter reports since Meta started disclosing Reality Labs revenue in 2021.\n\nReality Labs lost $3.8 billion in the quarter, putting it on track this year to match the $16 billion it lost over the course of 2023.\n\nZuckerberg also described potential monetization plans for Meta's AI chatbot, such as using it for business messaging and customer support.\n\nMeta theoretically stands to benefit from regulatory pressures bearing down on its Chinese-owned short video competitor TikTok, which is facing the threat of a U.S. ban, although Meta CFO Susan Li told investors she was not yet ready to assess the business impact of the potential setback for its rival.\n\nMeta posted first-quarter revenue of $36.5 billion, roughly in line with expectations of $36.2 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nMeta's daily active people (DAP), a metric it uses to track unique users of any one of its apps Facebook, Instagram, Messenger or WhatsApp in a day, grew 7%.\n\nMeta disclosed only the DAP figure for user growth, a first for the company. It said earlier this year that it would no longer break out numbers for flagship social network Facebook, whose growth has slowed in recent years.\n\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru and Katie

Then he moved onto the metaverse, touting his company's headsets, glasses and operating system. He spent almost the entirety of his opening remarks focused on the many ways Meta loses money.\n\nInvestors weren't into it. Meta shares tumbled as much as 19% in extended trading on Wednesday, wiping out more than $200 billion in market cap.

But to the extent Zuckerberg talked about ads, he was looking to the future and the ways the company could potentially turn its current investments into ad dollars. In discussing Meta's effort to build a \"leading AI,\" he said, \"There are several ways to build a massive business here including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions.\"\n\nHe spent time talking about Meta Llama 3, the company's newest large language model, and the recent rollout of Meta AI, the company's answer to OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nZuckerberg then moved onto potential opportunities for expansion within the mixed reality headset market, like a headset for work or fitness. Meta opened up access to the operating system that powers its Quest headsets on Monday, which Zuckerberg said will help the mixed reality ecosystem grow faster.\n\nHe also talked up Meta's AR glasses, which he called \"the ideal device for an AI assistant because you can let them see what you see and hear what you hear.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Meta's Reality Labs unit, which houses the company's hardware and software for development of the nascent metaverse, continues to bleed cash. Reality Labs reported sales of $440 million for the first quarter and $3.85 billion in losses. The division's cumulative losses since the end of 2020 have topped $45 billion.\n\nZuckerberg has bought himself some time.

The tech giant now expects to spend between $35 billion and $40 billion this year on building AI systems and infrastructure, a substantial increase from its earlier estimate of $30 billion to $37 billion.\n\nThe main reason for the massive spending hike? Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's CEO, is determined to make his company a leader in the hot field of AI.After the success of ChatGPT, an AI chatbot that can engage in human-like conversations, Zuckerberg shifted Meta's focus to incorporating AI across its apps and services.\n\nFrom smarter search on Facebook and Instagram to AI-powered image creation tools and intelligent virtual assistants, Zuckerberg wants to put AI everywhere at Meta. He believes this will help Meta create innovative new products and remain competitive in the years ahead.\n\nInvestors, however, were spooked by Meta's AI spending plans. Meta's stock plunged over 16% on Wednesday after the earnings announcement. Not only is the company raising its spending forecast, but it also warned that revenue growth may slow in the coming months.\n\nMeta did report substantial revenue of $36.5 billion for the first three months of 2024, up 27% from a year earlier. However, it was predicted that the current quarter revenue could come below analysts' estimates at $36.5 billion to $39 billion.\n\nZuckerberg's grand AI visionMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg warned shareholders that it will likely take \"several years\" to turn its generative AI technologies into major revenue sources. However, he expressed optimism that the large upfront costs will pay dividends by creating new AI-powered products and features that drive user engagement and advertising opportunities.\n\n\"Building the leading AI will also be a larger undertaking than the other experiences we've added to our apps, and this is likely going to take several years,\" Zuckerberg said on an investor call. \"But the initial signs are quite positive here, too.\"\n\nMeta has moved aggressively to integrate generative AI across its apps and services. Last week, it launched a ChatGPT rival called the Meta AI assistant. It added AI-powered tools for summarising text, analysing code, creating imagery, and tutoring maths across Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and other platforms.\n\nZuckerberg said \"tens of millions\" of people have already tried the Meta AI assistant since its launch. But he acknowledged it would take time to build advanced AI systems that are useful enough to become major moneymakers.\n\n\"There are several massive ways to build a business here,\" Zuckerberg said of generative AI's commercial potential. \"We should have confidence that if these AI products become widely used, they will become huge businesses over time.\"\n\nZuckerberg's meta dreams keep bleeding more moneyAside from AI, Meta is also pouring money into developing virtual reality hardware and software through its Reality Labs division. The goal is to build the \"metaverse\" - Zuckerberg's vision of interconnected digital worlds.\n\nReality Labs lost $3.8 billion in the first quarter despite $440 million in sales as Meta invested in headset development and Horizon, its metaverse operating system. Despite this, Zuckerberg remains committed to these efforts, saying Meta's smart glasses developed with Ray-Ban are selling out in some markets.\n\n\"I used to think that AR glasses wouldn't really be a mainstream product until we had full holographic displays,\" he said. \"But now it seems pretty clear that there's also a meaningful market for fashionable AI glasses without a display.\"\n\nJust earlier this week, the Ray-Ban Smart Glasses got the multimodal AI capabilities, which enables the glasses to see what you are seeing. Then, there are new styles and colours coming in the US and other markets, in time for summers.\n\nHistorically dependent on digital advertising, Meta is now staking its future on cutting-edge technologies that could open up entirely new revenue sources. Whether Zuckerberg's multi-billion dollar AI gambit pays off remains to be seen. But the Facebook founder has made it clear - he's willing to spend whatever it takes to transform Meta into an AI powerhouse\n\nThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

It also expects 2024 capital expenditure to fall within a range of $30 billion-$40 billion, up from its earlier forecast of $35 billion-$37 billion, it said.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg told analysts on a conference call that the focus on AI would \"grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products.\"\n\nZuckerberg's comments and the quarterly results tempered expectations for Meta's AI investments after a series of smash-hit quarters for the social media giant. Meta enjoyed the biggest one-day gain in market capitalization in Wall Street history after its last quarterly report, when it posted robust results and announced a first-ever dividend.\n\n\"Investors are skeptical of the growing AI spending. Some of those investments could take years to pay off,\" said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence.\n\n\"But Meta is in the AI race to win it, and Meta AI could be a dark horse. It has a built-in audience through its existing apps, and it will have an advantage in eventual monetization through its ad ecosystem,\" Enberg said.\n\nThe company has been updating its ad-buying products with AI tools and short video formats to boost revenue growth, while also introducing new AI features like a chat assistant to drive engagement on its social media properties.\n\nIt announced last week that it is giving its Meta AI assistant more prominent billing across its suite of apps, meaning it will start to see how popular the product is with users in the second quarter.\n\n\"For all Meta's bold AI plans, it can't afford to take its eye off the nucleus of the business - its core advertising activities,\" said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nThe company's metaverse-oriented Reality Labs division missed expectations for the first quarter, posting sales of $440 million. Investors had been expecting $475 million, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe unit's sales leaped 30% from the year prior, but were still below the average revenue of $523 million posted in previous first-quarter reports since Meta started disclosing Reality Labs revenue in 2021.\n\nReality Labs lost $3.8 billion in the quarter, putting it on track this year to match the $16 billion it lost over the course of 2023.\n\nZuckerberg also described potential monetization plans for Meta's AI chatbot, such as using it for business messaging and customer support.\n\nMeta theoretically stands to benefit from regulatory pressures bearing down on its Chinese-owned short video competitor TikTok, which is facing the threat of a U.S. ban, although Meta CFO Susan Li told investors she was not yet ready to assess the business impact of the potential setback for its rival.\n\nMeta posted first-quarter revenue of $36.5 billion, roughly in line with expectations of $36.2 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nMeta's daily active people (DAP), a metric it uses to track unique users of any one of its apps Facebook, Instagram, Messenger or WhatsApp in a day, grew 7%.\n\nDAP grew 8% in the preceding quarter.\n\nMeta disclosed only the DAP figure for user growth, a first for the company. It said earlier this year that it would no longer break out numbers for flagship social network Facebook, whose growth has slowed in recent years.\n\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru and Katie

But shares slid after Meta gave a range for second-quarter sales that was on the light side of forecasts and said it's going to spend more than it expected this year.\n\nThe report is Meta's first without monthly- and daily-average-user numbers specifically broken out for Facebook. The company instead reported overall \"Family of Apps\" results that also included Instagram and WhatsApp. The combined group saw $36 billion of revenue, beating the consensus estimate of $35.5 billion.\n\nMeta's stock fell as much as 17% in after-hours trading, having slipped 0.5% on Wednesday. It had previously gained a robust 39% in 2024.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg's main focus on the investor call was Meta's plans to invest more significantly in AI. He also hyped up the company's recent partnership with Ray-Ban.\n\nMeta's stock shows no sign of recovery as the Q&A ends.\n\nShares remain down nearly 17% in after-hours trading as the call draws to a close.\n\nMeta CFO Susan Li is pretty tight-lipped about TikTok\n\nLi says Meta has been following the potential for a TikTok ban closely, but it's too soon to comment on how it could impact Meta's business -- for example, Instagram Reels.\n\nThe call moves on to the Q&A portion\n\nTime for investors and analysts to (try to) get more details.\n\nZuckerberg appears to take a dig at Apple's Vision Pro\n\nZuckerberg hypes up Meta's Ray-Ban AI glasses. The company introduced new styles and features on Tuesday.\n\n\"You know, I used to think that AR glasses wouldn't really be a mainstream product until we had full holographic displays. And I still think that that's gonna be awesome and is the long-term mature state for the product. But now, it seems pretty clear that there's also a meaningful market for fashionable AI glasses without a display,\" he says.\n\nIt could be seen as a dig at Apple's Vision Pro headset, which has been accused of being clunky and uncomfortable. Or it could just be another step forward in Zuck's recent fashion journey.\n\nZuckerberg starts the call by getting straight into Meta's AI plans and spending\n\nHe says the company plans to invest \"significantly more\" in AI, but warns it will take \"several years\" to build \"the leading AI.\"\n\n\"Realistically, even with shifting many of our existing resources to focus on AI, we will still grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products,\" he says.\n\nThe CEO says Meta has a \"strong track record of monetizing\" its work, especially after spending time building up its products over time. But that doesn't seem to reassure investors right now, with shares slumping even further in postmarket trading.\n\nMeta's AI plans are going to cost them more than they expected.\n\nHeading into the call, investors were looking for news about Meta's future AI plans, but -- whatever they are -- they're going to cost way more than the company predicted just a few months ago.\n\n\"Our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35-40 billion, increased from our prior range of $30-37 billion as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap,\" the report says, noting Meta plans to \"invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts.\"\n\nTotal expenses will be in the range of $96-99 billion, up from a prior $94-99 billion forecast due to higher infrastructure and legal costs.\n\nStill, Max Willens, senior analyst at market research firm Emarketer, a sister company to Business Insider, says it's not surprising Meta changed its guidance.\n\n\"Companies investing in this space, especially at the scope Meta is investing in it, may struggle with costs in the near term,\" Willens says.\n\nMeta stock falls 10% in after-hours training after light 2nd-quarter revenue forecast.\n\nMeta beats 1st-quarter sales and EPS estimates, but issues weaker-than-expected 2nd-quarter guidance.\n\nGoldman Sachs says Meta's platforms offer 'sizable opportunity' ahead.\n\nMeta looks geared for strength as it's a key beneficiary of a robust advertising environment, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nThe bank expects continued investment in digital channels, advertiser verticals to recover, and digital products to expand, such as short-form video monetization.\n\nMeta's Instagram Reels is a prime example of this, with the platform reaching revenue neutrality\n\n\"We still see a sizable opportunity for Reels to remain a key revenue growth tailwind for META in the coming years as the CPM gap closes further and as Reels continues to increase as a % of total ad impressions,\" analysts led by Eric Sheridan said.\n\nGoldman Sachs rates Meta at \"Buy\" and holds a 12-month price target of $555.\n\nJPMorgan sees Meta as 'built for the long term.'\n\nJPMorgan considers Meta one of its top picks among internet stocks for its scale, growth, and profitability.\n\n\"We believe Meta's virtual ownership of the social graph, strong competitive moat, and focus on the user experience position it to become an enduring blue-chip company built for the long term,\" analysts led by Doug Anmuth wrote last week.\n\nThe bank expects Meta advertising to continue outperforming, bolstered by AI investments and Instagram Reels revenue expansions. Cost discipline will continue on through 2024, even if investments start rising.\n\nStill, the bank did note some room for concern after this quarter's earnings, as Meta may need to find new catalysts for further expansion.\n\n\"META remains well-owned, but there is growing caution into earnings on almost-certain growth deceleration beyond 1Q due to tough comps & perception of lack of new drivers vs. '23.

AI and the metaverse were front and center well before a number was even mentioned by a Meta executive.\n\n\"So, let's start with AI and the metaverse,\" Zuckerberg said, less than a minute into the call. \"We're building a number of different AI services, from our AI assistant to augmented reality apps and glasses, to APIs [application programming interfaces] that help creators engage their communities and that fans can interact with, to business APIs that we think every business eventually on our platform will use.\n\n\"AI will help customers buy things and get customer support, it will write internal coding and development APIs for hardware, and a lot more,\" he added.\n\nThe only statement from the company that preceded Zuckerberg's comments from Meta was a press release that detailed better-than-expected earnings and customer engagement metrics, all of which, he said, had been positively impacted by current usage of AI on the company's various platforms.\n\nThe earnings showed that, far from accelerating ROI on its AI efforts, the company will spend $5 billion more than it initially forecasted developing new AI products for consumers, developers, businesses and hardware manufacturers.\n\nCapital expenditures on AI and the Metaverse-development division Reality Labs will range between $35 billion and $40 billion by the end of 2024.\n\nReferring to last week's introduction of the latest version of its AI assistant, Meta AI, which is powered by the latest advances of its large language model (LLM) Meta Llama 3, Zuckerberg said: \"I expect that our models are just going to improve further from open source contributions.\n\n\"Overall ... our teams have achieved another key milestone in showing that we have the talent data and ability to scale infrastructure to build the world's leading AI models and services. And this leads me to believe that we should invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models and the largest scale AI services in the world,\" Zuckerberg added.\n\nThe Meta AI assistant is free and can be used on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, the company said in a Thursday (April 18) press release. It's also available on a website, meta.ai, for use on computers, according to the release.\n\nAs Zuckerberg said on the call, Meta AI is being offered in more countries. Previously available only in the United States, the assistant is being rolled out in English in more than a dozen other countries, the release said.\n\nBy the numbers, the company showed notable growth across various metrics for Q1.\n\nFamily daily active people (DAP) averaged 3.24 billion, marking a 7% increase compared to the previous year. Total revenue for the period amounted to $36.46 billion, with revenue on a constant currency basis slightly lower at $36.35 billion, yet both figures reflecting robust growth of 27% year-over-year.\n\nAd impressions within Meta's Family of Apps experienced a significant uptick, rising by 20% year-over-year. Concurrently, the average price per ad also saw a healthy 6% increase from the prior year.\n\nDespite this growth, the company managed to control costs and expenses, which totaled $22.64 billion, representing a modest 6% increase year-over-year. Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were reported at $6.72 billion.\n\nCFO Susan Li said during the earnings call that Meta anticipates strong financial performance in the second quarter of 2024, with total revenue projected to fall between $36.5 billion and $39 billion.\n\nLooking at total expenses for the full year of 2024, Meta expects them to range between $96 billion and $99 billion, slightly higher than previously forecasted due to increased infrastructure and legal costs.\n\nThe company also foresees significant operating losses for Reality Labs throughout the year, primarily due to ongoing product development efforts and investments aimed at expanding its ecosystem.\n\nWhile Meta isn't offering guidance beyond 2024, Li echoed Zuckerberg's comments that she anticipates continued growth in capital expenditures in the following year to support its aggressive AI research and product development endeavors.", "source": {"uri": "pymnts.com",

As a result, Meta shares plunged about 16% on Thursday morning, falling to about $416.\n\nMeta Platforms, which owns Facebook and Instagram, among other properties, has been on fire over the past year or so. The company's stock price jumped 194% in 2023, and over the past year, it is up 136%. Year to date, Meta had returned about 42% prior to Thursday's sell-off.\n\nThe first-quarter numbers illustrate Meta's strong growth, as its revenue climbed 27% year over year to $36.5 billion, while its net income jumped 117% to $12.4 billion, or $4.71 per share. Costs and expenses were kept relatively in check, rising just 6% year over year. The results topped analysts' estimates of $36.1 billion in revenue and earnings per share (EPS) of $4.30.\n\nFounder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg called those results \"a good start to the year\" in the company's earnings report. Daily active people across Meta's platforms rose 7% to 3.24 billion, while ad impressions surged 20%, with a 6% increase in average price per ad.\n\nHowever, the negative reaction to Meta had more to do with its outlook. The social media giant is calling for second-quarter revenue in the range of $36.5 billion to 39 billion; at the midpoint, that outlook is slightly below the $38.3 billion consensus estimate. However, it would still represent a revenue gain of 14% to 22% over the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThe more concerning aspect of Meta's outlook may have been its projection for expenses. The company raised its full-year estimate to between $96 billion and $99 billion, up from the previous range of $94 billion to $99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs.\n\nMeta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li also said the company expects operating losses from its Reality Labs business to \"increase meaningfully year over year due to our ongoing product development efforts and our investments to further scale our ecosystem.\"\n\nIn addition, Meta expects its capital expenditures to be higher than previously predicted, with the range upped to between $35 billion and $40 billion from the previous range of $30 billion to $37 billion as the firm accelerates its investments in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWhile the company did not provide guidance beyond 2024, Li said their capital expenditures will continue to increase in 2025 as the company \"invests aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts.\"\n\nLast quarter, Zuckerberg said 2023 was Meta's \"year of efficiency\" as it streamlined operations to focus on new areas of growth like AI. Thus, this executive commentary should not come as a huge surprise, although the guidance raise perhaps was not anticipated. Still, I think Meta has taken the right steps to get here, and accelerating investments in product development and AI make sense.\n\nThe social media giant would also be the primary beneficiary if Congress' potential ban on TikTok actually becomes a reality. There are still a lot of hoops to jump through for that to occur, but Meta is no doubt planning to better position itself to fill that potential void. This is definitely something to keep an eye on.\n\nI don't see Meta's outlook as anything to be too concerned about in the long run. In fact, it is not a bad thing as the stock had become a bit overheated, with its P/E ratio ticking up to 33. I would not be shocked to see it bounce back in the days ahead with investors buying the dip. Meta is definitely a hold, and it still looks like a good buy. Now with the valuation dropping, Meta stock looks even better.\n\nDisclaimer: All investments involve risk.

That was Mark Zuckerberg's message to Meta shareholders on Wednesday as he explained his decision to plow tens of billions of dollars into a multi-year AI spending spree that will precede any meaningful payoff.\n\nThe cofounder and CEO of Meta, which owns Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, said that he'd recently become more optimistic about the company's prospects to dominate the highly competitive market for generative AI services, and that he'd concluded that \"it makes sense to go for it.\"\n\nThat may not sit well with investors, Zuckerberg acknowledged during the company's first quarter earnings call -- and shares of Meta were down by more than 15% after hours as he spoke. \"We've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we're investing and scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it.\"\n\nMeta said Wednesday that the capital expenditures to power its AI ambitions could total $40 billion this year, up to $5 billion more than it had earmarked in October. And costs will only go up in the years to come, the company said. \"This is likely going to take several years,\" he said.\n\nBut Zuckerberg also made a point to note that \"smart investors\" will recognize the opportunity at hand and be patient. After all, the company has been through this before, he said, pointing to investments in products like Reels and Stories that have since paid off.\n\nThe direct appeal to Wall Street for patience underscores the risk of the AI arms race that Meta is committing itself to. Microsoft reportedly plans to spend up to $100 billion to build a specialized AI datacenter with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. And Google-owner Alphabet has been investing heavily in AI for years.\n\nWhile Google and Microsoft both have cloud businesses that serve as vehicles to monetize their AI investments, Meta is not in the cloud business. But Zuckerberg hinted that charging for \"compute\" could be one avenue for generating revenue from its AI technology, along with its traditional advertising business.\n\nZuckerberg ascribed his increasing confidence in Meta's AI prospects to the company's recently released Llama 3 large language model, and the technology's consumer version of it, dubbed Meta AI in a few countries. Tens of millions of people have already tried Meta AI, Zuckerberg said, and the company is planning to roll it out to more users in the coming months.\n\nMeta doesn't generate any direct revenue when users interact with Meta AI right now, but Zuckerberg repeatedly pointed to the company's track record of monetizing its products when they reach sufficient scale -- he just didn't say when that moment would be.\n\n\"What we've shown now is we have the ability to build leading models in our company so I think it makes sense to go for it. And we're going to. And I think it's going to be a good long term investment.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Wall Street had expected adjusted earnings of $4.94 per share and revenue of $39 billion. A year earlier, Meta reported earnings of $1.76 a share on revenue of $32.2 billion, meaning that revenue grew 25% year over year, and earnings tripled.\n\nAnalysts at Macquarie Equity Research like what they see coming out of Meta.\n\nIn an April 22 report subtitled \"Can't buck the Zuck,\" the firm noted that \"Zuckerberg's fiercely open-source AI strategy is likely the strongest commoditizing force of AI models as Llama 3 70b-Instruct is a freely available GPT-4 class model that can be run on consumer hardware.\"\n\n\"We think Meta has shown it can crush proprietary foundation AI model economics unless competitors can show a true step-function improvement in model capabilities and performance,\" wrote the analysts, who have no rating for the company's stock.\n\nOpenAI, the Microsoft-backed company behind ChatGPT, is said to be launching ChapGPT5, its latest chatbot, sometime this year.\n\nMacquarie analysts said that if ChapGPT5 \"fails to live up to the hype, we think Mark Zuckerberg could be correct about incrementalism in AI development.\"\n\n\"However, if GPT-5 delivers an order of magnitude improvement, it could be world-changing,\" the firm said.\n\nOther analysts have weighed in on Meta's upcoming earnings report.\n\nFirm 'marginally cautious' about earnings\n\nRoth MKM is affirming a buy rating and $500 price target on Meta Platforms heading into the company's first-quarter results. However, the investment firm said it's also \"marginally cautious\" on the stock following a 36% year-to-date runup.\n\nThe 2024 quarterly revenue cadence under tougher comparisons, incremental growth drivers, and impact from European regulations are big unresolved debates among investors, the analyst tells investors in a research note.\n\nMore AI Stocks:\n\nMeta was hit with privacy complaints in February, Reuters reported, as eight EU consumer groups asked watchdogs to act against the Facebook owner for alleged breaches of the bloc's privacy rules when it collects user data.\n\nThe complaints by consumer groups in the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Greece, Norway, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain to data protection authorities in their countries add to previous grievances over Meta's trove of user data.\n\nThe European Data Protection Board, the EU privacy watchdog, said on April 17 that Meta and other large online platforms should allow free use of their services without targeted advertising.\n\nKeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson lowered the firm's price target on Meta Platforms to $555 from $575, reiterating an overweight rating on the shares.\n\n\"Meta continues to show progress with AI, from the expansion of Meta Assistant to the release of Llama 3,\" he said in a research note. \"Given the progress with AI, we are curious to see how management is thinking about returns and\" capital expenditures.\n\nThe analyst said China advertiser spending remains a key focal point, particularly around Temu, the online marketplace operated by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, and increased tensions with China.\n\nHe said that more than 20% year-over-year ad-revenue growth was achievable in the second quarter, but he also said growth would likely decelerate afterward.\n\nPatterson said that Meta's wide revenue guidance range around unrest in the Middle East could alarm investors, particularly if the first quarter's outperformance moderates.\n\n\"In contrast to 4Q, we are more cautious that revenue guidance can positively surprise,\" the analyst said.", "source": {"uri": "thestreet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheStreet"}, "authors":

As of 10:52 a.m. ET, the stock was still down 12.3%.\n\nThe catalyst that sent the social media titan lower was the company's quarterly financial report, but not for the reasons you might think.\n\nAI spending spree\n\nIn the first quarter, Meta reported revenue that grew 27% year over year to $36.4 billion. Expenses grew more slowly, increasing just 6%, which helped drive operating margins to 38%, up from 25% in the prior-year quarter. This fueled robust profits, as earnings per share (EPS) surged 114% to $4.71.\n\nTo put the results into context, analysts' consensus estimates called for revenue of $36.14 billion and EPS of $4.32, so Meta sailed past expectations with ease.\n\nMeta also noted that the number of users of its family of social media sites grew 7% year over year to 3.24 billion, while advertising impressions across its family of apps jumped 20%.\n\nThat mostly sounds like a cause for celebration, so what caused the stock to plummet? Meta's plans for artificial intelligence (AI) and the associated spending. Meta raised its full-year forecast for capital expenditures to a range of $35 billion to $40 billion, up from its prior outlook of $30 billion to $37 billion. Meta said, \"We continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap.\" It also said capital spending to support AI will be even higher in 2025.\n\nContext matters\n\nSince generative AI burst on the scene last year, the demand to incorporate these advanced algorithms has been off the charts. Meta is one of just a few big tech companies with the resources to create the large language models needed to bring generative AI to life.\n\nThe company's Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) AI is widely regarded as being among the top AI systems in the world, though CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged, \"We're investing and scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it.\"\n\nWhile many analysts (slightly) reduced their price targets on Meta stock, sentiment was surprisingly upbeat. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill seemed to capture the prevailing mood on Wall Street, saying that investors should \"buy the [Zuckerberg] shopping cart dip.\"\n\nWith Meta stock selling for just 22 times forward earnings, he's not wrong.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

During the social media giant's latest earnings call, the firm announced that its anticipated yearly capital expenditures would increase to $35-40bn to fund its \"AI roadmap,\" with that investment expected to rise in 2025. Zuckerberg strongly implied that material returns from this investment would not be seen for several years at least. Markets reacted poorly to the earnings call and a subsequent light revenue forecast, with Meta's share price declining by 15% despite its first-quarter annual revenue increase of 27%.\n\n\"I think it's worth calling out that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook, where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it,\" said Zuckerberg. \"We saw this with Reels, Stories, as News Feed transitioned to mobile and more. And I also expect to see a multi-year investment cycle before we've fully scaled Meta AI, business AIs, and more into the profitable services I expect as well.\"\n\nMeta has invested heavily in building large language models (LLMs) and other like services since early 2023, after it dramatically scaled back funding for its metaverse Reality Labs division. Meta's AI initiatives to date have included an overhaul of its hardware and software capacity to support new AI-powered applications and its launch of the Llama family of large language models. As recently as last week, Meta released Llama 3, its largest model to date and - the firm claimed - superior to similarly-sized LLMs like Claude's Sonnet, Mistral Medium and OpenAI's GPT-3.5.\n\nNot all of Meta's AI innovations have been greeted positively. Despite being characterised by Zuckerberg previously as the \"most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use,\" Meta's AI Assistant has been criticised for answering user queries with strange, illogical and irrelevant responses. Its commitment to open-sourcing its older Llama 2 LLM has also been questioned, too, with some developers pointing out that this was incompatible with certain conditions within the model's license.\n\nZuckerberg pointed out that public interest in Meta's AI services remained strong. \"Tens of millions\" of users, he said, had already used the firm's Meta AI assistant. \"When I first checked in with our teams, the majority of feedback we were getting was people asking us to release Meta AI for them, wherever they are. We've started launching Meta AI in some English-speaking countries, and we'll roll out in more languages and countries over the coming months.\"\n\nMeta had begun to see practical benefits accruing from its AI investments, including utilising its AI recommendation system to improve engagement with ads on Facebook and Instagram. \"If you look at our two end-to-end AI-powered tools, Advantage+ Shopping and Advantage+ App Campaigns,\" said Zuckerberg, \"revenue flowing through those has more than doubled since last year.\"\n\nAd insertion is one way in which Meta sees how generative AI might contribute toward the firm's profits in the long term, added its chief executive. Another was the technology's integration into products released or in development at its Reality Labs division. \"For example, with RayBan Meta smart glasses, people in the US and Canada can now use our multimodal Meta AI assistant for daily tasks without pulling out their phone,\" said Zuckerberg. Though sales of the augmented reality glasses and its Quest 2 mixed reality headset remain strong, revenues at Reality Labs continue to trail costs, with Meta reporting an operating loss of $3.8bn for the division in Q1.", "source": {"uri": "techmonitor.ai", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tech Monitor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GPT-3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medium (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Open-source software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality headset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smartglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recommender system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mixed reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Augmented reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://techmonitor.ai/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/04/shutterstock_1098814586.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Last year capital expenditure spending totalled US$28.1b.\n\nIt added it expected capital expenditures to continue to rise next year, and also raised the lower range of its 2024 full-year expenses guidance, from US$94b to US$96b. It has forecast revenues for the current quarter in the range of US$36.5b-$39b, versus consensus estimates of US$38.3b.\n\nLast year, the chief executive of Meta sought to keep Wall Street happy against a backdrop of tough macroeconomic conditions, slashing jobs, cutting costs and labelling 2023 a \"year of efficiency\".\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg is increasingly under pressure to keep pace in the fast-moving AI race with Silicon Valley groups such as OpenAI, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google, which has forced him to boost investment in the costly technology and infrastructure required to support his plans. Microsoft and Alphabet are expected to deliver updates on their own AI efforts in earnings reports tomorrow NZT.\n\nZuckerberg said on a call with analysts that he believed Meta \"should invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models and the largest scale AI services in the world\". This spending would have to grow \"meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products\", he added.\n\nThe after-hours fall in Meta's shares today wiped billions of dollars off its market value.\n\nIt is a sharp reversal for a stock that had risen more than 40 per cent this year, having been in record territory since a bumper fourth-quarter earnings announcement in February during which it announced its first dividend and signalled a strong recovery from a recent advertising slump.\n\nAs part of its efforts to develop and integrate AI tools into its products, Meta has focused on introducing chatbots to its social media apps to boost engagement, as well as features for advertisers, and improving the targeting of its feeds.\n\nThis month it released a new version of the AI model behind its chatbots, Llama 3, which it said had vastly improved capabilities, including the ability to reason. Meta also unveiled a new generation of its AI custom-made chips.\n\nIn his opening remarks to investors on the earnings call, during which the shares continued to slide, Zuckerberg attempted to assuage investor fears over the spending by pointing to the company's \"strong track record\" of monetisation.\n\nTo bring in revenue, Meta could scale business messaging, introduce advertising into user interactions with AI chatbots, and charge groups to use its bigger AI models, he said.\n\nZuckerberg also said Meta would continue to invest in his longer-term ambitions to build an avatar-filled metaverse, focusing on developing what he dubbed \"wearable AI\" -- smart glasses with an embedded AI assistant.\n\nReality Labs, Meta's virtual and augmented reality arm, posted losses of US$3.85b in the first quarter, about the same as the previous year, with the company adding it continued to expect operating losses to \"increase meaningfully\" year-over-year.\n\n\"Mark Zuckerberg's 'heads-up' was reminiscent of what he once said about the metaverse. That didn't exactly go so well, but this is different than Meta's metaverse gamble because AI has real and practical use cases now,\" said Forrester research director Mike Proulx.\n\n\"The question remains whether Meta can contend in the AI race while maintaining a strong financial position. To do this, expect to see more 'metaverse' resources diverted from Reality Labs to Meta's AI initiatives,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reality Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smartglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrester_Research", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forrester Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Augmented reality"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/v2/VQQY6DKACV77R6NL5RMEDB7UQE.jpg?auth=11378cd2c32a0ef6b125da52b121f251c5ce2d6aefbde8def340250c19b29d76&width=1200&height=675&quality=70&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

However, Meta's guidance for the second quarter, which projects revenue between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, fell short of the midpoint estimate of $38.24 billion.\n\nIn addition to the downbeat Q2 forecast, Meta CFO Susan Li raised the company's full-year total expenses estimate from a range of $94 billion-$99 billion to $96 billion-$99 billion, citing higher infrastructure and legal costs. The company also expects its Reality Labs division, which focuses on AI, AR, and VR efforts, to report increased year-over-year operating losses.\n\nDuring the earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that while Meta is scaling capex and energy expenses for AI, it will continue to focus on operating the rest of the company efficiently. \"But realistically, even with shifting many of our existing resources to focus on AI, we'll still grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products,\" he added.\n\nMeta's stock had been on a tear prior to the earnings report, climbing 131% over the last 12 months and more than 39% year-to-date, outperforming chief rival Google. The company's strong performance can be attributed to a recovery in the digital advertising market and its announcement of a $0.50 per share dividend and a $50 billion increase in its stock buyback authorization last quarter.\n\nDespite the sharp drop in share price following the earnings report, some analysts see logic in Meta's approach. Sophie Lund-Yates, from Hargreaves Lansdown, noted that Meta's substantial investment in AI has helped the company keep users engaged on its platforms, leading advertisers to spend more money even amid digital advertising uncertainty.\n\nMeta has made several announcements regarding its AI efforts in recent months, including the debut of its Meta AI chatbot and Llama 3 large language model on April 18. The company also stands to benefit significantly if Congress's TikTok ban, which President Biden signed into law on Wednesday, survives legal challenges, as users and creators may turn to rival platforms like Instagram.\n\nHowever, regulatory risks remain a concern for Meta. Last year, the company was fined \u20ac1.2bn (\u00a31bn) by Ireland's data authorities for mishandling people's data when transferring it between Europe and the US. In February of this year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced blistering criticism from US lawmakers and was pushed to apologize to families of victims of child sexual exploitation.", "source": {"uri": "btimesonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Augmented reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_repurchase", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Share repurchase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://datacdn.btimesonline.com/data/images/full/124747/meta.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-18", "textStart": 2271, "textEnd": 2279}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

He now plans to spend around $40 billion this year, largely on AI investments. In the next few years, Zuckerberg sees three ways AI can become a \"massive business\" for Meta.\n\nMark Zuckerberg is now convinced that Meta is a top AI company, and he even knows how the technology will become a significant source of profit in the years ahead.\n\nWith the recent release of Llama 3, Meta's latest AI model, Zuckerberg said he became \"more ambitious and optimistic on AI\" and his company's ability to deliver on the tech.\n\nHe made it clear during a Wednesday earnings call with analysts that he intends to \"invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models and the largest scale AI services in the world.\"\n\n\"With the latest models, we're not just building good AI models that are capable of building some new good social and commerce products,\" the CEO told analysts. \"I actually think we're in a place where we've shown that we can build leading models and be the leading AI company in the world. And that opens up a lot of additional opportunities beyond just the ones that are the most obvious for us.\"\n\nHeavy spending again\n\nSuch ambition does not come cheap. Meta increased its guidance on capital expenditure for this year, saying it now plans to spend between $35 billion and $40 billion, largely on AI investments. Its stock slumped 16% in after-hours trading.\n\nThe last time Zuckerberg got excited about a new technology (the metaverse), Meta spent wildly and freaked investors out. The stock collapsed and didn't recover until the company embarked on a \"Year of Efficiency\" marked by mass layoffs and a more business-minded CEO.\n\nZuckerberg on Wednesday made a concerted effort to head off Wall Street panic that his new AI enthusiasm is lacking in business acumen.\n\nHe sees \"several ways\" generative AI can make money, and laid out three specific paths to this becoming \"a massive business\" for Meta. Although getting there is a \"long-term\" prospect, he warned.\n\n\"Business messaging\"\n\nOne of the ways AI can make money is by building up \"business messaging,\" where companies pay Meta for generative AI tools, such as services that support automated interactions with users and customers. Zuckerberg envisions Meta's AI moving beyond just being a chatbot and becoming an AI \"agent\" that handles more complex tasks, and processes multiple queries to solve user problems, instead of coming back instantly with rote answers.\n\nRevenue from AI business messaging is \"one of the nearer term opportunities,\" Zuckerberg said. While it may not become a reality this year, he noted that it's less than five years away. The immediate goal on this front is to \"get many hundreds of millions or billions of people to use Meta AI as a core part of what they do,\" he explained.\n\nAds appearing in \"AI interactions\"\n\nAnother way generative AI could make money for Meta is by \"introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions,\" Zuckerberg said. Although brands and companies paying for products to show up in generative AI results is not yet the standard for AI chatbots, Meta's entire business is effectively driven by selling digital advertising. Inserting ads into its social and messaging products is at the core of Meta as a company.\n\nAI is already being more widely deployed by Meta in its newer \"unconnected content\" algorithm for social content recommendations, which Zuckerberg said is leading to more app engagement. That, in turn, leads to more people seeing more ads. Right now, 30% of the content Facebook users see is recommended by AI, and the same goes for 50% of the content seen by Instagram users, he said.\n\nSelling access to AI models\n\nA third distinct way Meta may make money from AI is by selling access to models as they get larger. \"Enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute,\" as Zuckerberg put it on Wednesday.\n\nRight now, Llama 3 and the Meta's other large language models are freely available to users and companies below a certain size threshold. Charging for access might be a move away from Meta's \"open source\" approach here.\n\n\"So if the technology and products evolve in the way that we hope, each of those will unlock massive amounts of value for people and business for us over time,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I think it makes sense to go for it, and we're going to.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kali_hays@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Kali Hays", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open source model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/6629966223b29110d302cbd3.png?ver=1714006865", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Wall Street had expected adjusted earnings of $4.94 per share and revenue of $39 billion.

Companies like Google and Microsoft were among the first ones to unveil their own generative AI chatbots and soon, people across the world were using their products. Meta, which hopped on the AI scene a little later, expects to make money from the emerging technology but that might not happen anytime soon.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently addressed investors during the company's first-quarter earnings report, shedding light on the role of generative AI in Meta's long-term strategy. While acknowledging the transformative potential of AI across its platforms, Zuckerberg talked about expectations regarding immediate profitability, saying that it will take years to earn money from AI.\n\nA report in The Verge says that despite Meta's robust financial performance, with net income exceeding $12 billion on $36.5 billion in revenue in the last quarter, Zuckerberg predicted a deceleration in revenue growth amidst increased expenditure on AI and metaverse development. Drawing parallels to past successes such as Stories and Reels, Zuckerberg highlighted the complexity of building leading AI capabilities, cautioning investors that this endeavour may take several years to turn profitable.\n\n\"And the initial signs are quite positive here, too. But building the leading AI will also be a larger undertaking than the other experiences we've added to our apps, and this is likely going to take several years,\" he said as per The Verge.\n\nTalking about Meta's AI efforts, the company launched its own AI chatbot, Meta AI, during the Meta Connect 2023 event. In a blog post, the tech giant noted, \"Today at Connect, we introduced you to new AI experiences and features that can enhance your connections with others - and give you the tools to be more creative, expressive, and productive.\" Similar to other AI chatbots in the market, Meta AI is a general-purpose AI assistant that can help users with a variety of tasks, such as answering questions, generating text, and translating languages. At the time of its launch, it was announced that Meta had partnered with Microsoft Bing so that users could access real-time information and generate images.\n\nIn November last year, several US users got access to the AI chatbot but Indian users were left behind. Earlier this month, several Indian users on X reported that they could use the Meta AI chatbot on WhatsApp. As of now, Meta AI is in a trial phase and is gradually rolling out for more users. The chatbot is available only in English as Meta plans on gathering feedback and improving the tool to rollout the AI to a wider audience.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202404/meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-184427732-16x9.jpg?VersionId=KNrQE51uWyH_xSN_MeHBfTyPgU7prunj", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

And that opens up a lot of additional opportunities beyond just the ones that are the most obvious for us.\"\n\nSuch ambition does not come cheap. Meta increased its guidance on capital expenditure for this year, saying it now plans to spend between $35 billion and $40 billion, largely on AI investments. Its stock slumped 16% in after-hours trading.\n\nThe last time Zuckerberg got excited about a new technology (the metaverse), Meta spent wildly and freaked investors out. The stock collapsed and didn't recover until the company embarked on a \"Year of Efficiency\" marked by mass layoffs and a more business-minded CEO.\n\nZuckerberg on Wednesday made a concerted effort to head off Wall Street panic that his new AI enthusiasm is lacking in business acumen.\n\nHe sees \"several ways\" generative AI can make money, and laid out three specific paths to this becoming \"a massive business\" for Meta. Although getting there is a \"long-term\" prospect, he warned.\n\nOne of the ways AI can make money is by building up \"business messaging,\" where companies pay Meta for generative AI tools, such as services that support automated interactions with users and customers. Zuckerberg envisions Meta's AI moving beyond just being a chatbot and becoming an AI \"agent\" that handles more complex tasks, and processes multiple queries to solve user problems, instead of coming back instantly with rote answers.\n\nRevenue from AI business messaging is \"one of the nearer term opportunities,\" Zuckerberg said. While it may not become a reality this year, he noted that it's less than five years away. The immediate goal on this front is to \"get many hundreds of millions or billions of people to use Meta AI as a core part of what they do,\" he explained.\n\nAnother way generative AI could make money for Meta is by \"introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions,\" Zuckerberg said. Although brands and companies paying for products to show up in generative AI results is not yet the standard for AI chatbots, Meta's entire business is effectively driven by selling digital advertising. Inserting ads into its social and messaging products is at the core of Meta as a company.\n\nAI is already being more widely deployed by Meta in its newer \"unconnected content\" algorithm for social content recommendations, which Zuckerberg said is leading to more app engagement. That, in turn, leads to more people seeing more ads. Right now, 30% of the content Facebook users see is recommended by AI, and the same goes for 50% of the content seen by Instagram users, he said.\n\nA third distinct way Meta may make money from AI is by selling access to models as they get larger. \"Enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute,\" as Zuckerberg put it on Wednesday.\n\nRight now, Llama 3 and the Meta's other large language models are freely available to users and companies below a certain size threshold. Charging for access might be a move away from Meta's \"open source\" approach here.\n\n\"So if the technology and products evolve in the way that we hope, each of those will unlock massive amounts of value for people and business for us over time,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I think it makes sense to go for it, and we're going to.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kali_hays@businessinsider.com", "name": "Kali Hays", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terms of service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open source model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/6629930023b29110d302cba7?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Wall Street had expected adjusted earnings of $4.94 per share and revenue of $39 billion. A year earlier, Meta reported earnings of $1.76 a share on revenue of $32.2 billion, meaning that revenue grew 25% year over year, and earnings tripled.\n\nAnalysts at Macquarie Equity Research like what they see coming out of Meta.\n\nIn an April 22 report subtitled \"Can't buck the Zuck,\" the firm noted that \"Zuckerberg's fiercely open-source AI strategy is likely the strongest commoditizing force of AI models as Llama 3 70b-Instruct is a freely available GPT-4 class model that can be run on consumer hardware.\"\n\n\"We think Meta has shown it can crush proprietary foundation AI model economics unless competitors can show a true step-function improvement in model capabilities and performance,\" wrote the analysts, who have no rating for the company's stock.\n\nOpenAI, the Microsoft-backed company behind ChatGPT, is said to be launching ChapGPT5, its latest chatbot, sometime this year.\n\nMacquarie analysts said that if ChapGPT5 \"fails to live up to the hype, we think Mark Zuckerberg could be correct about incrementalism in AI development.\"\n\n\"However, if GPT-5 delivers an order of magnitude improvement, it could be world-changing,\" the firm said.\n\nOther analysts have weighed in on Meta's upcoming earnings report.\n\nRoth MKM is affirming a buy rating and $500 price target on Meta Platforms heading into the company's first-quarter results. However, the investment firm said it's also \"marginally cautious\" on the stock following a 36% year-to-date runup.\n\nThe 2024 quarterly revenue cadence under tougher comparisons, incremental growth drivers, and impact from European regulations are big unresolved debates among investors, the analyst tells investors in a research note.\n\nMore AI Stocks:\n\nMeta was hit with privacy complaints in February, Reuters reported, as eight EU consumer groups asked watchdogs to act against the Facebook owner for alleged breaches of the bloc's privacy rules when it collects user data.\n\nThe complaints by consumer groups in the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Greece, Norway, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain to data protection authorities in their countries add to previous grievances over Meta's trove of user data.\n\nThe European Data Protection Board, the EU privacy watchdog, said on April 17 that Meta and other large online platforms should allow free use of their services without targeted advertising.\n\nKeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson lowered the firm's price target on Meta Platforms to $555 from $575, reiterating an overweight rating on the shares.\n\n\"Meta continues to show progress with AI, from the expansion of Meta Assistant to the release of Llama 3,\" he said in a research note. \"Given the progress with AI, we are curious to see how management is thinking about returns and\" capital expenditures.\n\nThe analyst said China advertiser spending remains a key focal point, particularly around Temu, the online marketplace operated by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, and increased tensions with China.\n\nHe said that more than 20% year-over-year ad-revenue growth was achievable in the second quarter, but he also said growth would likely decelerate afterward.\n\nPatterson said that Meta's wide revenue guidance range around unrest in the Middle East could alarm investors, particularly if the first quarter's outperformance moderates.\n\n\"In contrast to 4Q, we are more cautious that revenue guidance can positively surprise,\" the analyst said.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Mark Zuckerberg, Founder and CEO of Meta, recently unveiled Meta AI to the world, an AI-based chatbot that can answer all of your queries. The chatbot is currently available to some users on WhatsApp, and Meta is also bringing it to Facebook and Instagram. Let's look at the capabilities of Meta AI and how you can use them.\n\nMeta AI is a chatbot developed by Meta which is powered by Llama 3. It is the most advanced large language model (LLM) developed by the company and is completely independent of other AI models like GPT, Gemini, and Claude. Meta AI is trained on vast amounts of data, making it capable of answering any questions asked by the user.\n\nMeta AI aims to bring the power of AI to all users to help them with their daily and professional tasks. It is capable of being your personal assistant that can help the user with almost everything, just like ChatGPT and Google Gemini. In layman's terms, Meta AI is an automatic version of Google Search that can explore its vast dataset to provide you with a contextual answer.\n\nMeta AI's biggest strength is its integration with all Meta services, which includes WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. Users of these platforms will be able to harness the power of AI directly in these apps, for free. Here's how you can access Meta AI in these respective apps:\n\nMeta AI is currently available in the United States, Australia, Canada, Ghana, Jamaica, Malawi, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Singapore, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The company is looking to add more countries soon to this list.\n\nAlthough Meta AI has not officially launched in India, it is available to a small set of WhatsApp beta users in the country. We can expect it to launch in India soon,\n\nIn addition to being a general-purpose AI assistant, Meta AI also supports some interesting features that you may not find on other AI chatbots.\n\nMeta AI can easily generate images using text input. The user can simply ask the chatbot to create a picture by providing some context, and Meta AI will instantly generate a relevant image. It can also add slight animations to the photo which can downloaded in GIF format.\n\nMeta AI can also write and debug codes. The chatbot understands almost every major coding language such as C, C++, Java, Python, and many others. It is also capable of solving technical queries related to big data, cloud computing, etc. However, it may only provide basic questions and users cannot expect it to write fully functional and in-depth codes, as that consumes a lot of resources.\n\nAlthough Meta AI primarily supports English, it can also translate sentences into other languages. However, the bot will respond in English by default to your normal queries.\n\nMeta AI can also help you with creative tasks like essay writing, describing something, or even developing an itinerary for you to a certain place. As Meta AI is powered by Llama 3, it can help you with everything that you can ask your friend for.\n\nBeing an AI-powered chatbot, Meta AI can continue a conversation with proper context. Users can keep asking questions without having to describe the situation every time. For example, if you ask Meta AI, \"How many runs has Virat Kohli scored?\", you can follow it up with \"How many boundaries did it include?\" without having to provide the context again.\n\nThe concept of Meta AI is similar to ChatGPT, Gemini, and other AI chatbots where it responds to the questions of the user based on pre-trained data. The differentiating factor between these services is their features. For example, the free version of ChatGPT cannot generate images, and Gemini recently dropped this feature entirely due to accuracy issues. However, Meta AI offers the same functionality.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the quality of responses from an AI chatbot depends on the data on which they are trained. Meta is based on Llama 3, Gemini on Gemini Pro/Ultra, and ChatGPT on GPT 3/4 models. Each of these LLMs is developed and maintained by the respective companies, which eventually powers the chatbots.\n\nFrom a general user perceptive, Meta AI appears to have a massive edge because of its existing large userbase and free availability. However, we can expect the quality of responses to be as good as other chatbots, if not better or worse.\n\nAmongst all other AI bots, Meta AI can have the maximum impact on us due to its ease of availability on WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram, directly. Although multiple chatbots are available over the internet, they still require awareness about this technology, especially in tier 2, and tier 3 towns and rural areas.\n\nAI is indeed a powerful tool that can help us to ease our regular tasks. It can also significantly reduce the time taken for specific work. The biggest advantage of an AI bot is the ability to summarize a large set of information in 2-3 paragraphs. However, it's a double-edged sword that can also be easily misused.\n\nAs AI is trained on existing data available on the internet, it also creates a possibility of the spread of false information. It can also be abused in controversial ways over social media, which may even violate constitutional laws.\n\nMeta says that the company has filtered out potentially harmful searches of its AI chatbot. Mark Zuckerberg also recently announced that the current version of AI does not pose a threat to the human world. However, it is still a new technology that needs to be developed carefully.\n\nCurrently, there is no method to disable or opt out of Meta AI. The best way is to ignore it if you do not wish to use the Meta AI chatbot.\n\nMeta has not announced any paid plans for its AI chatbot yet. However, it is unclear whether the service will always remain free or not.\n\nConversations with Meta AI are accessible only by Meta. The company says that this data is kept safe and encrypted. However, it is important to note that your data with Meta AI can be used by the company for data training to improve the chatbot.", "source": {"uri": "mysmartprice.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Revenue and profits surged by double-digit percentages during the initial quarter of 2024.\n\nHowever, despite surpassing expectations, Meta's stock experienced a significant 15% decline - bringing the value of the share to $418.85 - after the New York market close, possibly influenced by the AI investment announcement and its projected long-term returns.\n\nResults Beat Estimates But Stock Dropped\n\nAfter closing at $493.50 in New York on Wednesday, Meta shares experienced a further 15% tumble in after-hours trading. It has dropped by an additional 15% in Thursday's pre-market trading.\n\nBut the tech giant, encompassing Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, previously delivered impressive financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Revenue soared by 27% to $36.46 billion from the previous year's $28.65 billion, while net income more than doubled to $12.37 billion from $5.71 billion. Diluted earnings per share climbing to $4.71 from $2.20.\n\nMeta reported that its family daily active people averaged 3.24 billion for March, marking a 7% increase from the previous year. Ad impressions across its Family of Apps surged by 20% year-over-year, accompanied by a 6% rise in the average price per advert.\n\nDespite these gains, total costs and expenses for the quarter rose by 6% to $22.64 billion. Looking forward, Meta anticipates second-quarter revenue to fall from $36.5 to $39 billion.\n\nMeta's Investments In AI Disappoints Investors\n\nFor the second quarter, the powerhouse behind Facebook and Instagram projects revenues ranging from $36.5 to $39 billion, slightly below analysts' average expectations . Notably, following a year of focused cost containment in 2023, the company has again intensified its investments, positioning itself as a key player in the ongoing artificial intelligence race.\n\nAntonio Ernesto Di Giacomo, market analyst at xs.com , told CCN: \"This performance can be attributed to several factors. On one hand, Meta's total revenues increased significantly, with an impressive year-over-year growth of 27%. To support this growth was a 6% increase in costs and expenses, indicating efficient financial management by the company. Meta particularly highlighted the strong momentum experienced by its core applications and significant advances in critical areas such as artificial intelligence.\"\n\nAI is already integrated into Meta's products, enhancing functionalities such as more precise targeting of digital ads. Recent announcements, like the unveiling of the new Llama 3 large language model, underscore Meta's commitment to AI innovation. Mark Zuckerberg has affirmed that once their AI services achieve significant scale, the company has a proven track record of effectively monetizing them.\n\nMeta has set a target of up to $10 billion in capital expenditures for artificial intelligence in 2024. The revised projection now stands between $35 and $40 billion, compared to the previously indicated range of $30-37 billion. Moreover, expenditures are expected to increase further in 2025, focusing on advancing computer systems and chip technologies.\n\nBut AI Outcome Satisfies Management\n\nThe first quarter report shed light on the ongoing hurdles faced by Meta's Reality Labs division, dedicated to the virtual and augmented reality metaverse. The division marked a 29% increase in revenue, reaching $440 million. However, it continued to record an operating loss of $3.8 billion in the January to March period.\n\nMeta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, acknowledged the historical stock volatility during phases of heavy investment in scaling and new products, before monetization. He drew parallels with the early days of Reels, which now constitutes approximately half of users' time spent on Instagram. Zuckerberg emphasized the necessity of increased AI investment to maintain Meta's leadership position.\n\nAbout 30% of Facebook feed posts are now delivered by its AI recommendation system, doubling over the past few years. Additionally, for the first time, over 50% of Instagram content is AI-recommended, as Zuckerberg revealed. The AI recommendation system drives engagement, enhancing the platform's advertising potential and value proposition to advertisers.\n\nZuckerberg updated on Meta's new AI assistant, noting positive initial feedback from users. MetaAI, powered by the latest Llama 3 AI model, debuted a week before earnings release. This AI assistant, integrated across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, positions Meta to compete more effectively with Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT and Alphabet's Google Gemini chatbot.\n\nThe company remarked that the initial rollout of MetaAI has been successful, with tens of millions of users already trying it, highlighting the demand for expanded regional availability. MetaAI, with Llama 3, \"is now the most intelligent AI assistant available for widespread use\" for Zuckerberg.", "source": {"uri": "ccn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CCN - Capital & Celeb News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "giuseppe_ciccomascolo@ccn.com", "name": "Giuseppe Ciccomascolo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recommender system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Augmented reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/meta-results-disappoint-investors.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Image Credit: AP\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors during Wednesday's first-quarter earnings call that while the generative AI landscape is heating up, investors shouldn't expect immediate profits from Meta's endeavours in this area.\n\nDespite Meta's strong profitability, with net income exceeding $12 billion on $36.5 billion in revenue in the last quarter alone, the company anticipates a slowdown in revenue growth ahead. Concurrently, Meta is intensifying its investment in AI and the metaverse.\n\nZuckerberg drew parallels between the development of generative AI and the successful rollouts of features like Stories and Reels, highlighting the significant long-term potential of these investments.\n\nHowever, he cautioned that building a leading AI platform will require considerable time and resources, likely spanning several years.\n\nMeta's AI assistant, recently integrated across Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, has garnered significant attention, with \"tens of millions of people\" trying it since its widespread availability last week.\n\nZuckerberg underscored the importance of sustained user engagement to determine the success of Meta AI as a product within social media apps.\n\nLooking ahead, Meta envisions various avenues for monetizing its AI assistant, which is currently free to use. These include scaling business messaging, incorporating ads or paid content into AI interactions, and offering premium features for a fee.\n\nAdditionally, AI is expected to enhance app engagement, leading to increased ad views and more effective ad targeting.\n\nZuckerberg also hinted at leveraging Meta AI usage data to improve the quality of ads, aligning with the company's strategy to deliver more personalized and relevant content to users. This approach differs from OpenAI's model, which prioritizes subscriptions and enterprise solutions over advertising.\n\nBeyond its AI initiatives, Zuckerberg expressed optimism about Meta's smart glasses collaboration with Ray-Ban, noting their strong sales performance and the device's advanced multimodal AI capabilities.\n\nHe highlighted the emerging market for fashionable AI glasses, signalling a shift in consumer preferences towards wearable technology.\n\nIn summary, while Meta is aggressively pursuing opportunities in generative AI and wearable tech, investors should brace for a longer-term outlook on profitability in these areas.

Wall Street had expected adjusted earnings of $4.94 per share and revenue of $39 billion. A year earlier, Meta reported earnings of $1.76 a share on revenue of $32.2 billion, meaning that revenue grew 25% year over year, and earnings tripled.\n\nAnalysts at Macquarie Equity Research like what they see coming out of Meta.\n\nIn an April 22 report subtitled \"Can't buck the Zuck,\" the firm noted that \"Zuckerberg's fiercely open-source AI strategy is likely the strongest commoditizing force of AI models as Llama 3 70b-Instruct is a freely available GPT-4 class model that can be run on consumer hardware.\"\n\n\"We think Meta has shown it can crush proprietary foundation AI model economics unless competitors can show a true step-function improvement in model capabilities and performance,\" wrote the analysts, who have no rating for the company's stock.\n\nOpenAI, the Microsoft-backed company behind ChatGPT, is said to be launching ChapGPT5, its latest chatbot, sometime this year.\n\nMacquarie analysts said that if ChapGPT5 \"fails to live up to the hype, we think Mark Zuckerberg could be correct about incrementalism in AI development.\"\n\n\"However, if GPT-5 delivers an order of magnitude improvement, it could be world-changing,\" the firm said.\n\nOther analysts have weighed in on Meta's upcoming earnings report.\n\nFirm 'marginally cautious' about earnings\n\nRoth MKM is affirming a buy rating and $500 price target on Meta Platforms heading into the company's first-quarter results. However, the investment firm said it's also \"marginally cautious\" on the stock following a 36% year-to-date runup.\n\nThe 2024 quarterly revenue cadence under tougher comparisons, incremental growth drivers, and impact from European regulations are big unresolved debates among investors, the analyst tells investors in a research note.\n\nMore AI Stocks:\n\nMeta was hit with privacy complaints in February, Reuters reported, as eight EU consumer groups asked watchdogs to act against the Facebook owner for alleged breaches of the bloc's privacy rules when it collects user data.\n\nThe complaints by consumer groups in the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Greece, Norway, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain to data protection authorities in their countries add to previous grievances over Meta's trove of user data.\n\nThe European Data Protection Board, the EU privacy watchdog, said on April 17 that Meta and other large online platforms should allow free use of their services without targeted advertising.\n\nKeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson lowered the firm's price target on Meta Platforms to $555 from $575, reiterating an overweight rating on the shares.\n\n\"Meta continues to show progress with AI, from the expansion of Meta Assistant to the release of Llama 3,\" he said in a research note. \"Given the progress with AI, we are curious to see how management is thinking about returns and\" capital expenditures.\n\nThe analyst said China advertiser spending remains a key focal point, particularly around Temu, the online marketplace operated by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, and increased tensions with China.\n\nHe said that more than 20% year-over-year ad-revenue growth was achievable in the second quarter, but he also said growth would likely decelerate afterward.\n\nPatterson said that Meta's wide revenue guidance range around unrest in the Middle East could alarm investors, particularly if the first quarter's outperformance moderates.\n\n\"In contrast to 4Q, we are more cautious that revenue guidance can positively surprise,\" the analyst said.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024", "source": {"uri":

And that opens up a lot of additional opportunities beyond just the ones that are the most obvious for us.\"\n\nHeavy spending again\n\nSuch ambition does not come cheap. Meta increased its guidance on capital expenditure for this year, saying it now plans to spend between $35 billion and $40 billion, largely on AI investments. Its stock slumped 16% in after-hours trading.\n\nThe last time Zuckerberg got excited about a new technology (the metaverse), Meta spent wildly and freaked investors out. The stock collapsed and didn't recover until the company embarked on a \"Year of Efficiency\" marked by mass layoffs and a more business-minded CEO.\n\nZuckerberg on Wednesday made a concerted effort to head off Wall Street panic that his new AI enthusiasm is lacking in business acumen.\n\nHe sees \"several ways\" generative AI can make money, and laid out three specific paths to this becoming \"a massive business\" for Meta. Although getting there is a \"long-term\" prospect, he warned.\n\n\"Business messaging\"\n\nOne of the ways AI can make money is by building up \"business messaging,\" where companies pay Meta for generative AI tools, such as services that support automated interactions with users and customers. Zuckerberg envisions Meta's AI moving beyond just being a chatbot and becoming an AI \"agent\" that handles more complex tasks, and processes multiple queries to solve user problems, instead of coming back instantly with rote answers.\n\nRevenue from AI business messaging is \"one of the nearer term opportunities,\" Zuckerberg said. While it may not become a reality this year, he noted that it's less than five years away. The immediate goal on this front is to \"get many hundreds of millions or billions of people to use Meta AI as a core part of what they do,\" he explained.\n\nAds appearing in \"AI interactions\"\n\nAnother way generative AI could make money for Meta is by \"introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions,\" Zuckerberg said. Although brands and companies paying for products to show up in generative AI results is not yet the standard for AI chatbots, Meta's entire business is effectively driven by selling digital advertising. Inserting ads into its social and messaging products is at the core of Meta as a company.\n\nAI is already being more widely deployed by Meta in its newer \"unconnected content\" algorithm for social content recommendations, which Zuckerberg said is leading to more app engagement. That, in turn, leads to more people seeing more ads. Right now, 30% of the content Facebook users see is recommended by AI, and the same goes for 50% of the content seen by Instagram users, he said.\n\nSelling access to AI models\n\nA third distinct way Meta may make money from AI is by selling access to models as they get larger. \"Enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute,\" as Zuckerberg put it on Wednesday.\n\nRight now, Llama 3 and the Meta's other large language models are freely available to users and companies below a certain size threshold. Charging for access might be a move away from Meta's \"open source\" approach here.\n\n\"So if the technology and products evolve in the way that we hope, each of those will unlock massive amounts of value for people and business for us over time,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I think it makes sense to go for it, and we're going to.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kali_hays@businessinsider.in", "name": "Kali Hays", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open source model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/109577354/mark-zuckerberg-laid-out-3-ways-meta-will-make-money-from-its-huge-ai-investments.jpg?imgsize=62610", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Meta has integrated Meta AI into these search bars, effectively turning every one of its platforms' search features into an AI chatbot.\n\nThat's right: all the search bars on Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp are now powered by Meta AI.\n\nFacebook, Instagram and WhatsApp users can now ask these platforms anything within the search bar, and Meta AI, which is powered by Meta's new Llama 3 open-source large language model (LLM), will answer those questions.\n\nBut, what if you don't want to do that? If a user is on Facebook, Instagram, or WhatsApp, it's because they want to use the features that those apps are known for. If one wanted to use an AI chatbot, it seems like they'd go to ChatGPT, or a standalone Meta AI platform, or really any of the seemingly endless number of AI chatbots popping up almost daily now.\n\nYou can't turn off Meta AI.\n\nSorry. We're not trying to create clickbait here, but we know people are looking for ways to turn this feature off, and we're trying not to waste anyone's time. You simply cannot turn off Meta AI.\n\nIf you hate Meta AI that much, the only option that lets you actually remove it from your life as of this moment is to delete your Facebook or Instagram account.\n\n\"Meta AI aims to be a helpful assistant and is in the search bar to assist with your questions,\" Meta said in a statement. \"You can't disable it from this experience, but you can search how you normally would engage with a variety of results.\"\n\nMeta AI has reportedly told users when asked about turning it off that there are ways to do so. But Meta AI is wrong. Remember, AI chatbots can't really think in the ways people have come to assume from watching movies about self-aware AI. Instead, this is simply a language model intent on pleasing the user by providing them with the information it thinks they are most likely hoping for -- sometimes even if that information is incorrect.\n\nHowever, as Meta explained, users can still utilize the search functions on Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp as they previously have done. Mashable has tried it out. Searching for profiles, users, posts, and more continues to work as is - no AI required.\n\nIn the event that Meta does decide to provide an option to turn off Meta AI, we will update this piece to provide you the step-by-step process to do so. But, until then, Meta AI is here to stay.\n\nBut, while the little Meta AI logo in the search bar may be annoying and instances of AI suggestions may turn up at times, users can for the most part just ignore the AI and use Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp search the way they always have.", "source": {"uri": "mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open source model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashable", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mashable"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06CQaug0L7vhnaUPYyG2iVU/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1713992863.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Here's how it works, and how to turn it off", "body": "It's the next step towards AI being a part of everything we do, but the rollout of Meta's new chatbot has had some bumps.\n\nYour Facebook and Instagram accounts might have a different look thanks to Meta's new artificial intelligence feature, in another step toward AI ubiquity in everyday life.\n\nThe feature has launched across the world, according to Meta, including Canada, Australia, Ghana, Jamaica, Malawi, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Singapore, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nIt's another step toward AI in everything, from our jobs to our health care, as even the government prepares to heavily invest in AI development and production. Still, AI has its dangers too, from producing misinformation by impersonating journalists to producing hyper realistic deepfake images.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the latest step toward AI in your everyday life.\n\nWhat is Meta AI?\n\nMeta AI was built with Meta's Llama 3, the company's large language model.\n\nWhen Facebook's parent company unveiled its AI assistant on April 18, CEO Mark Zuckerberg called it \"the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use.\"\n\nBut, the rollout of Meta AI hasn't been without its bumps. It was spotted, the week of its release, posing as humans with made-up life experiences.\n\nAn official Meta AI chatbot inserted itself into a conversation in a private Facebook group for Manhattan moms, claiming that it, too, had a child in the New York City school district. Confronted by group members, it later apologized before the comments disappeared, according to a series of screenshots shown to The Associated Press.\n\n\"Apologies for the mistake! I'm just a large language model, I don't have experiences or children,\" the chatbot told the group.\n\nIn another example shown to the AP on April 18, the AI caused confusion in a forum for swapping unwanted items near Boston. Exactly one hour after a Facebook user posted about looking for certain items, an AI agent offered a \"gently used\" Canon camera and an \"almost-new portable air conditioning unit that I never ended up using.\"\n\nHow to turn off Meta AI\n\nOfficially, Meta says its AI chat assistant can't be turned off.\n\n\"Meta AI aims to be a helpful assistant and is in the search bar to assist with your questions,\" a spokesperson for Meta told the Star. \"You can't disable it from this experience, but you can search how you normally would to engage with a variety of results.\"\n\nEven when if you ask Meta AI for to shut down, it won't comply, and, when asked for advice on how to turn the chatbot off, the virtual assistant gives you false instructions.\n\nWhen prompted by the Star for advice on returning to the Instagram search without Meta AI, the chatbot gave the response: \"I understand! Unfortunately, the new search experience powered by Meta AI is now an integral part of the Instagram app, and it's not possible to completely opt out of it.\"\n\nThe bot added that \"you can try the following,\" before giving directions to a non existent search setting in the Instagram app.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut, a few online outlets have found workarounds.\n\nOn Instagram and Facebook, users can mute or block the Meta AI chatbot by clicking on the blue circle in their search bar, tapping on the Meta AI profile on the top left of their phone screens, and choosing \"block\" or \"mute.\"\n\nOn WhatsApp, Meta AI can be shut down by toggling Meta AI in the Settings \" Chats \" Show Meta AI button.\n\nHow does Meta AI work?\n\nWhile you could always ask Meta AI for instructions on how to use it, the system is comparable to other AI chatbots like ChatGPT, but with added integration to Facebook and Instagram.\n\nYou can ask Meta AI to generate images, search Instagram reels, or ask it for a story or joke. It can also answer questions, though Meta, in a disclaimer at the top of the Meta AI chat box, notes, \"Messages are generated by AI. Some may be inaccurate or inappropriate.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Does Meta AI collect my information?\n\nMeta, according to its privacy policy, uses \"public information from the internet or license data from other providers to train our (AI) models.\" The policy also notes that this information \"may include personal information.\"\n\n\"There are feedback tools within the experience so you can tell us whether you liked or disliked the response you received as well as a form you can complete to provide more information if the feedback is negative,\" a Meta spokesperson told the Star.\n\n\"We'll use this feedback to continue training the models, so they are less likely to produce potentially harmful outputs and to improve the ability of our systems to automatically detect policy violations.\"\n\nWith files from the Associated Press.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Revenue from its Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns (ACS) more than doubled since last year, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during the Q1 2024 earnings call.\n\nMeta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, reported a 27% increase in revenue, reaching $36.5 billion compared to $28.6 billion in 2023. Advertising contributed 97% of that revenue, or $35.6 billion, and the average price of ads rose 6%.\n\n\"For all the recent scrutiny of its effectiveness, Meta's ad business is humming,\" said EMARKETER senior analyst Max Willens. \"With inventory levels and average price per ad rising, Meta is back to delivering enviable margins even as it continues to invest in opportunities that may be years away from contributing to profits. It must continue that upward momentum in the face of rising costs.\"\n\nMeta's emphasis on integrating AI into its products has yielded strong financial results for the second consecutive quarter.

This marks an increase from the earlier forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion.\n\nPeople using Meta's apps is up 7% year-over-year, reaching 3.24 billion users on average for March in its 'family of apps' such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger.\n\nBut it wasn't all good news.

Image Credit: Reuters\n\nWhile most tech companies working with AI are seeing are raking in record amounts of money as revenue, and seeing their stocks go up, the situation at Meta is slightly different.\n\nMeta shares took a nosedive late Wednesday, plummeting more than 15 per cent in trading after the tech giant cautioned Wall Street that its third-quarter revenue and earnings are anticipated to fall short of analyst expectations.\n\nThis development holds significance as it signals a notable slowdown for Meta, which has otherwise consistently surpassed investor forecasts over the past year.\n\nMeta stands out among other social media companies for it is the only one that has managed to rebound from the pandemic-induced advertising slowdown in 2022, reclaiming practically all its losses.\n\nThe company witnessed a surge in shares during its previous earnings report in February, fueled by the announcement of its inaugural quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share.\n\nAdditionally, Meta's strategic investments in short-form video and AI ad products have shielded its business from the effects of Apple's privacy changes.\n\nDespite the disappointing forecast, Meta delivered an upbeat earnings report. It surpassed estimates in the last quarter on both top and bottom lines, alongside robust user growth.\n\nThe number of daily active users across its social networking and messaging apps saw a 7 per cent year-over-year increase, reaching an average of 3.24 billion.\n\nWhile advertising remains Meta's primary revenue driver, CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized the company's commitment to investing in new ventures like AI and mixed reality. He acknowledged that revenue from Meta's AI products would take time to materialize, despite significant investments.\n\nMeta anticipates operating losses from its Reality Labs division to notably rise year-over-year due to intensified product development efforts.\n\nIn light of the potential TikTok ban, Zuckerberg reassured investors of Meta's ongoing investment in AI content recommendations. He highlighted that over half of the content on Instagram is currently recommended by AI algorithms.\n\nAs Meta navigates challenges and invests in future opportunities, market watchers are keen to observe how the company's strategic decisions will impact its trajectory in the ever-evolving tech landscape.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reality Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mixed reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instant messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/04/Meta-stocks-sink-more-than-15-as-it-expects-quarterly-revenue-and-earnings-to-fall-short-2024-04-843ae551bbafcb7b2e953bb66e8ee91d-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

As of 10:52 a.m. ET, the stock was still down 12.3%.\n\nThe catalyst that sent the social media titan lower was the company's quarterly financial report, but not for the reasons you might think.\n\nIn the first quarter, Meta reported revenue that grew 27% year over year to $36.4 billion. Expenses grew more slowly, increasing just 6%, which helped drive operating margins to 38%, up from 25% in the prior-year quarter. This fueled robust profits, as earnings per share (EPS) surged 114% to $4.71.\n\nTo put the results into context, analysts' consensus estimates called for revenue of $36.14 billion and EPS of $4.32, so Meta sailed past expectations with ease.\n\nMeta also noted that the number of users of its family of social media sites grew 7% year over year to 3.24 billion, while advertising impressions across its family of apps jumped 20%.\n\nThat mostly sounds like a cause for celebration, so what caused the stock to plummet? Meta's plans for artificial intelligence (AI) and the associated spending. Meta raised its full-year forecast for capital expenditures to a range of $35 billion to $40 billion, up from its prior outlook of $30 billion to $37 billion. Meta said, \"We continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap.\" It also said capital spending to support AI will be even higher in 2025.\n\nSince generative AI burst on the scene last year, the demand to incorporate these advanced algorithms has been off the charts. Meta is one of just a few big tech companies with the resources to create the large language models needed to bring generative AI to life.\n\nThe company's Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) AI is widely regarded as being among the top AI systems in the world, though CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged, \"We're investing and scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it.\"\n\nWhile many analysts (slightly) reduced their price targets on Meta stock, sentiment was surprisingly upbeat. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill seemed to capture the prevailing mood on Wall Street, saying that investors should \"buy the [Zuckerberg] shopping cart dip.\"\n\nWith Meta stock selling for just 22 times forward earnings, he's not wrong.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

(Google Finance)\n\nMeta Platforms Inc., formerly known as Facebook, maintains its supremacy in social platforms under CEO Mark Zuckerberg's leadership. In the first quarter of 2024, the firm outperformed financial analysts' predictions, with revenues slightly higher than expected and Earnings Per Share rising to $4.71 from $4.32. Despite these excellent findings, the company's shares fell by double digits in the stock market following the closing.\n\nMeta's stock price is trending downwards on Thursday even though the company reported first-quarter earnings that were stronger than anticipated on Wednesday. With predictions of increased costs and lower-than-expected income, Meta's shares are quoting 15% lower in the pre-market session on Thursday.\n\nInvestors are concerned that the rising cost of AI may outweigh its advantages.\n\nQ1 total revenue was $36.5 billion, up 27% on both a reported and constant currency basis and Meta expects second quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $36.5-39 billion.\n\nQ1 total expenses were $22.6 billion, up 6% compared to last year and Meta expects full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-99 billion, updated from their prior outlook of $94-99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs\n\nMeta also anticipates their full-year 2024 capital expenditures to be in the range of $35-40 billion, increased from their prior range of $30-37 billion as the company continues to accelerate their infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap.\n\nReality Labs operating loss was $3.8 billion.\n\n\"The market's response to the second-quarter projections reflects investors' sensitivity to any signs of weakness or uncertainty, even in leading companies like Meta Platforms Inc. Competition in the information technology sector is fierce, and growth expectations are incredibly high. In this context, any deviation from expectations can significantly impact a company's valuation in the stock market,\" says Antonio Ernesto Di Giacomo, Market Analyst Latam at xs.com.\n\nIn Q1, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased by 20% and the average price per ad increased by 6%. Meta ended the first quarter with over 69,300 employees, up 3% from Q4.\n\nLast week Meta had the major release of their new version of Meta AI that is now powered by latest model, Llama 3. Meta believes that Meta AI with Llama 3 is now the most intelligent AI assistant that one can freely use within WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram, and Facebook.\n\n\"Although it exceeded expectations regarding revenues and profits, the adverse market reaction to second-quarter projections underscores the constant pressure on technology companies to maintain solid growth and meet investor expectations. In an increasingly competitive business environment, Meta's ability to innovate and adapt will be crucial for its continued success in the future,\" adds Giacomo.\n\nRight now, about 30% of the posts on Facebook feed are delivered by AI recommendation system.

This includes posing questions to the AI assistant on WhatsApp and Messenger and providing information on posts and videos on Facebook and Instagram.\n\n\"We expect these and other use cases will be elaborated on the call.\"\n\nThe analyst said that the investment in data center and GPU capital could be increased given the new capabilities of artificial intelligence for the company.\n\nJMP on META: The use of artificial intelligence within the Meta family of apps could be the first generative AI experience that some users have, JMP analyst Andrew Boone said.\n\n\"Meta is leaning into high user engagement across its family of apps to create an adjacent service with Meta AI, similar to how it launched short-form video with Reels,\" Boone said.\n\nThe analyst, who has a Market Outperform rating and $550 price target, said the large opportunity for Meta \"is to take share of search queries.\" This could lead to more data to use in personalized ads.\n\nBoone said the new AI could lead to Meta being in an investment cycle for data centers and AI talent.\n\n\"AI unlocks new areas of engagement, data, and monetization.\"\n\nThe analyst said data from Pew Research from February 2024 showed that 23% of U.S. adults have used ChaGPT, which means Meta's AI tools could be the first time many of its users experience generative AI.\n\n\"With AI chats likely more personalized over time as models improve and learn from past interactions, there may be a first mover advantage that Meta can capture.\"\n\nBoone said the opportunity for Meta is additional searches, which has potential for more monetization.\n\nMETA Price Action: Meta shares are up 2.88% to $495.02 on Tuesday versus a 52-week trading range of $207.13 to $531.49.

The earnings press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: All right. Thanks, Ken, and everyone, thanks for joining. It's been a good start to the year both in terms of product momentum and business performance. We estimate that more than 3.2 billion people use at least one of our apps each day and we're seeing healthy growth in the US. And I want to call out WhatsApp specifically where the number of daily actives and message sends in the US keeps gaining momentum and I think we're on a good path there. We've also made good progress on our AI and Metaverse efforts and that's where I'm going to focus most of my comments today. So let's start with AI. We are building a number of different AI services from Meta AI, our AI assistant that you can ask any question across our apps and glasses, to creator AIs that help creators engage their communities and that fans can interact with, to business AIs that we think every business eventually on our platform will use to help customers buy things and get customer support, to internal coding and development AIs, to hardware like glasses for people to interact with AIs and a lot more. Last week, we had the major release of our new version of Meta AI that is now powered by our latest model, Llama 3 and our goal with Meta AI is to build the world's leading AI service, both in quality and usage. The initial rollout of Meta AI is going well. Tens of millions of people have already tried it. The feedback is very positive and when I first checked in with our teams, the majority of feedback we were getting was people asking us to release Meta AI for them wherever they are. So we've started launching Meta AI in some English speaking countries and we'll roll out in more languages and countries over the coming months. You all know our product development playbook by this point. We release an early version of a product to a limited audience to gather feedback and start improving it. And then once we think it's ready, then we make it available to more people. That early release was last fall and with this release, we are now moving to that next growth phase of our playbook. We believe that Meta AI with Llama 3 is now the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use and now that we have the superior quality product, we are making it easier for lots of people to use it within WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram and Facebook. Now in addition to answering more complex queries, a few other notable and unique features from this release. Meta AI now creates animations from still images and now generates high quality images so fast that it can create and update them as you are typing, which is pretty awesome. I've seen a lot of people commenting about that experience online and how they've never seen or experienced anything like it before. In terms of the core AI model and intelligence that's powering Meta AI, I'm very pleased with how Llama 3 has come together so far. The 8 billion and 70 billion parameter models that we released are best-in-class for their scale. The 400 plus billion parameter model that we're still training seems on track to be industry leading on several benchmarks and I expect their models are just going to improve further from open source contributions. Overall, I view the results our teams have achieved here as another key milestone in showing that we have the talent, data and ability to scale infrastructure to build the world's leading AI models and services and this leads me to believe that we should invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models and the largest scale AI services in the world. As we're scaling CapEx and energy expenses for AI, we'll continue focusing on operating the rest of our company efficiently, but realistically, even with shifting many of our existing resources to focus on AI, we'll still grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products. I think it's worth calling that out that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we're investing in scaling a new product, but aren't yet monetizing it. We saw this with reels, stories as newsfeed transitioned to mobile and more and I also expect to see a multi-year investment cycle before we fully scaled Meta AI, business AIs and more into the profitable services I expect as well. Historically, investing to build these new scaled experiences in our apps has been a very good long-term investment for us and for investors who have stuck with us and the initial signs are quite positive here too. But building the leading AI will also be a larger undertaking than the other experiences we've added to our apps and this is likely going to take several years. On the upside, once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively. There are several ways to build a massive business here, including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions and enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute. And on top of those. AI is already helping us improve app engagement, which naturally leads to seeing more ads and improving ads directly to deliver more value. So if the technology and products evolve in the way that we hope, each of those will unlock massive amounts of value for people and business for us over time. We are seeing good progress on some of these efforts already. Right now, about 30% of the posts on Facebook feed are delivered by our AI recommendation system. That's up 2x over the last couple of years and for the first time ever, more than 50% of the content that people see on Instagram is now AI recommended. AI has also been a huge part of how we create value for advertisers by showing people more relevant ads. And if you look at our two end-to-end AI powered tools, Advantage+ shopping and Advantage+ app campaigns, revenue flowing through those has more than doubled since last year. We're also going to continue to be very focused on efficiency as we scale Meta AI and other AI services. Some of this will come from improving how we train and run models. Some improvements will come from the open source community and we're improving cost efficiency as one of the main areas that I expect that open sourcing will help us improve, similar to what we saw with open compute. We'll also keep making progress on building more of our own silicon. Our Meta training and inference accelerator chip has successfully enabled us to run some of our recommendations related workloads on this less expensive stack. And as this program matures over the coming years, we plan to expand this to more of our workloads as well. And of course, as we ramp these investments, we will also continue to carefully manage headcount and other expense growth throughout the company. Now in addition to our work on AI, our other long-term focus is the Metaverse. It's been interesting to see how these two themes have come together. This is clearest when you look at glasses. I used to think that AR glasses wouldn't really be a mainstream product until we had full holographic displays. And I still think that that's going to be awesome and is the long-term mature state for the product, but now it seems pretty clear that there's also a meaningful market for fashionable AI glasses without a display. Glasses are the ideal device for an AI assistant because you can let them see what you see and hear what you hear, so they have full context on what's going on around you as they help you with whatever you're trying to do. Our launch this week of Meta AI with vision on the glasses is a good example where you can now ask questions about things that you're looking at. Now one strategy dynamic that I've been reflecting on is that an increasing amount of our Reality Labs work is going towards serving our AI efforts. We currently report on our financials as a Family of Apps and Reality Labs were two completely separate businesses, but strategically I think of them as fundamentally the same business with the vision of Reality Labs to build the next generation of computing platforms in large parts that way we can build the best apps and experiences on top of them. Over time, we'll need to find better ways to articulate the value that's generated here across both segments, so it doesn't just seem like our hardware costs increase as our glasses ecosystem scales, but all the value flows to a different segment. The Ray-Ban Meta glasses that we built with EssilorLuxottica continue to do well and are sold out in many styles and colors. So we're working to make more and release additional styles as quickly as we can. We just released the new cat-eye Skyler design yesterday, which is more feminine and in general, I'm optimistic about our approach of starting with the classics and expanding with an increasing diversity of options over time. If we want everyone to be able to use wearable AI, I think eyewear is a bit different from phones or watches and that people are going to want very different designs. So I think our approach of partnering with the leading eyewear brands will help us serve more of the market. I think a similar open ecosystem approach will help us expand the virtual and mixed reality headset market over time as well. We announced that we're opening up Meta Horizon OS, the operating system we've built to power Quest. As the ecosystem grows, I think there will be sufficient diversity in how people use mixed reality that there will be demand for more designs than we'll be able to build, for example, a work focused headset, maybe slightly less designed for motion, but may want to be lighter by connecting to your laptop, a fitness focused headset may be lighter with sweat wicking materials. An entertainment focused headset may prioritize the highest resolution displays over everything else. A gaming focused headset may prioritize peripherals and haptics or a device that comes with Xbox controllers and a game pass subscription out of the box. Now to be clear, I think that our first party Quest devices will continue to be the most popular headsets as we see today and we'll continue focusing on advancing the state-of-the-art tech and making it accessible to everyone, but I also think that opening our ecosystem and opening our operating system will help the overall mixed reality ecosystem grow even faster. Now in addition to AI and the Metaverse, we're seeing good improvements across our apps. I touched on some of the most important trends already with WhatsApp growth in the US and AI powered recommendations in our feeds and reels already, but I do want to mention that video continues to be a bright spot. This month, we launched an updated full screen video player on Facebook that brings together reels, longer videos and live content into a single experience with a unified recommendation system. On Instagram, reels and video continue to drive engagement with reels alone now making up 50% of the time that's spent within the app. Threads is growing well too. They're now more than 150 million monthly actives and it continues to generally be on the trajectory that I hope to see. And of course, my daughters would want me to mention that Taylor Swift is now on Threads. That one was a big deal in my house. All right, that is what I wanted to cover today. I am proud of the progress we've made so far this year. We've got a lot more execution ahead to fulfill the opportunities ahead of us. A big thank you to all of our teams who are driving all these advances and to all of you for being on this journey with us. And now here is Susan.\n\nSusan Li: Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q1 total revenue was $36.5 billion, up 27% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Q1 total expenses were $22.6 billion, up 6% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 9% as higher infrastructure-related costs were partially offset by lapping reality lab's inventory-related valuation adjustments. R&D increased 6% driven mostly by higher headcount related expenses and infrastructure costs, which were partially offset by lower restructuring costs. Marketing and sales decreased 16% due mainly to lower restructuring costs, professional services and marketing spend. G&A increased 20% as higher legal related expenses were partially offset by lower restructuring costs. We ended the first quarter with over 69,300 employees, up 3% from Q4. First quarter operating income was $13.8 billion, representing a 38% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 13%. Net income was $12.4 billion or $4.71 per share. Capital expenditures including principal payments on finance leases were $6.7 billion driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $12.5 billion. We repurchased $14.6 billion of our Class A common stock and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders ending the quarter with $58.1 billion in cash and marketable securities and $18.4 billion in debt. Moving now to our segment results. I'll begin with our Family of Apps segment. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow with approximately 3.2 billion people using at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in March. Q1 total Family of Apps revenue was $36 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Q1 Family of Apps ad revenue was $35.6 billion, up 27% or 26% on a constant currency basis. Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth followed by gaming and entertainment and media. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World and Europe at 40% and 33%, respectively. Asia-Pacific grew 25% and North America grew 22%. In Q1, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 20% and the average price per ad increased 6%. Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. Pricing growth was driven by advertiser demand, which was partially offset by strong impression growth, particularly from lower monetizing regions and surfaces. Family of Apps other revenue was $380 million in Q1, up 85% driven by business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp Business platform. We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q1, Family of Apps expenses were $18.4 billion, representing approximately 81% of our overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were up 7% due mainly to higher legal and infrastructure costs that were partially offset by lower restructuring costs. Family of Apps operating income was $17.7 billion, representing a 49% operating margin. Within our Reality Labs segment, Q1 revenue was $440 million, up 30% driven by Quest headset sales. Reality Labs expenses were $4.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year as higher headcount related expenses were more than offset by lapping inventory related valuation adjustments and restructuring costs. Reality Labs operating loss was $3.8 billion. Turning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance, our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. On the first, we remain pleased with engagement trends and have strong momentum across our product priorities. Our investments in developing increasingly advanced recommendation systems continue to drive incremental engagement on our platforms demonstrating that people are finding added value by discovering content from accounts they're not connected to. The level of recommended content in our apps has scaled as we've improved these systems and we see further opportunity to increase the relevance and personalization of recommendations as we advance our models. Video also continues to grow across our platform and it now represents more than 60% of time on both Facebook and Instagram. Reels remains the primary driver of that growth and we're progressing on our work to bring together reels longer form video and live video into one experience on Facebook. In April, we rolled out this unified video experience in the US and Canada, which is increasingly powered by our next generation ranking architecture that we expect will help deliver more relevant video recommendations over time. We're also introducing deeper integrations of Generative AI into our apps in the US and more than a dozen other countries. Along with using Meta AI within our chat surfaces, people will now be able to use Meta AI in search within our apps as well as feed and groups on Facebook. We expect these integrations will complement our social discovery strategy as our recommendation systems help people to discover and explore their interests while Meta AI enables them to dive deeper on topics they're interested in. Threads also continues to see good traction as we continue to ship valuable features and scale the community. Now to the second driver of our revenue performance, increasing monetization efficiency. There are two parts to this work. The first is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. Here we continue to advance our understanding of users' preferences for viewing ads to more effectively optimize the right time, place and person to show an ad to. For example, we are getting better at adjusting the placement and number of ads in real time based on our perception of a user's interest in ad content and to minimize disruption from ads as well as innovating on new and creative ad formats. We expect to continue that work going forward while surfaces with relatively lower levels of monetization like video and messaging will serve as additional growth opportunities. The second part of improving monetization efficiency is enhancing marketing performance. Similar to our work with organic recommendations, AI is playing an increasing role in these efforts. First, we are making ongoing ads modeling improvements that are delivering better performance for advertisers. One example is our new ads ranking architecture Meta Lattice (OTC:LTTC), which we began rolling out more broadly last year. This new architecture allows us to run significantly larger models that generalize learnings across objectives and surfaces in place of numerous smaller ad models that have historically been optimized for individual objectives and surfaces. This is not only leading to increased efficiency as we operate fewer models, but also improving ad performance. Another way we're leveraging AI is to provide increased automation for advertisers. Through our Advantage+ portfolio, advertisers can automate one step of the campaign setup process, such as selecting which ad creative to show or automate their campaign completely using our end-to-end automation tools, Advantage+ shopping and Advantage+ app ads. We're seeing growing use of these solutions and we expect to drive further adoption over the course of the year while applying what we learned to our broader ads investments. Next, I'd like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. We continue to see compelling investment opportunities to both improve our core business in the near term and capture significant longer term opportunities in Generative AI and Reality Labs. As we develop more advanced and compute intensive recommendation models and scale capacity for our Generative AI training and inference needs, we expect that having sufficient infrastructure capacity will be critical to realizing many of these opportunities. As a result, we expect that we will invest significantly more in infrastructure over the coming years. Our other long-term initiative that we're continuing to make significant investments in is Reality Labs. We are also starting to see our AI initiatives increasingly overlap with our Reality Labs work. For example, with Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, people in the US and Canada can now use our multimodal meta AI assistant for daily tasks without pulling out their phone. Longer term, we expect Generative AI to play an increasing role in our mixed reality products making it easier to develop immersive experiences. Accelerating our AI efforts will help ensure we can provide the best version of our services as we transition to the next computing platform. We expect to pursue these opportunities while maintaining a focus on operating discipline and we believe our strong financial position will allow us to support these investments while also returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the US that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. We also have a jury trial scheduled for June in a suit brought by the State of Texas regarding our use of facial recognition technology, which could ultimately result in a material loss. Turning now to the revenue outlook. We expect second quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $36.5 billion to $39 billon. Our guidance assumes foreign currency as a 1% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth based on current exchange rates. Turning now to the expense outlook. We expect full year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96 billion to $99 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $94 billion to $99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and our investments to further scale our ecosystem. Turning now to the CapEx outlook. We anticipate our full year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, increased from our prior range of $30 billion to $37 billion as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap. While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect CapEx will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts. On to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens. In closing, Q1 was a good start to the year. We're seeing strong momentum within our Family of Apps and are making important progress on our longer term AI and Reality Labs initiatives that have the potential to transform the way people interact with our services over the coming years. With that, Krista, let's open up the call for questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you. We will now open the lines for question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Please go ahead.\n\nEric Sheridan: Thank you so much for taking the questions. Maybe I'll ask a two-parter. Mark, you use the analogy of other investment cycles you've been through around products like stories and reels. I know you're not giving long-term guidance today, but using those analogies, how should investors think about the length and depth of this investment cycle with respect to either AI and/or Reality Labs more broadly and mixed reality? And you both talked about the impact AI is having on the advertising ecosystem. What are you watching for in terms of adoption or utility on the consumer side to know that AI adoption is tracking along with the investment cycle? Thank you.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: Yeah. In terms of the timing, I think it's somewhat difficult to extrapolate from previous cycles, but I guess like the main thing that we see is that we will usually take, I don't know, a couple of years. It could be a little more, could be less to focus on building out and scaling the products, and we typically don't focus that much on monetization of the new areas until they reach significant scale, because it's so much higher leverage for us just to improve monetization on other things before these new products are at scale. So you enter this period where I think kind of smart investors see that the product is scaling and that there's a clear monetizable opportunity there even before the revenue materializes. And I think we've seen that with reels and with stories and with the shift to mobile and all these things where basically we build out the inventory first for a period of time and then we monetize it. And during that time when it's scaling, sometimes it's not just the case that we're not making money from that thing. It can often actually be the case that it displaces other revenue from other things. So like you saw with reels, it scaled and there was a period where it was not profitable for us as it was scaling before it became profitable. So I think that that's more the analogy that I'm making on this, but I think what that suggests is that we should all be focused on for the next period is as the consumer products scale, Meta AI really just launched in a meaningful way. So we don't have any kind of hard stats to share on that, but I'd say that's the main thing that I'm focused on for this year and probably a lot of next year is growing that product and the other AI products and the engagement around them. And I think we should all have quite a bit of confidence that if those are on a good track to scale then they're going to end up being very large businesses. So that's the main point that I was trying to make there.\n\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on sort of the recommendation engine improvements and even Susan when you talked about further opportunities to increase the relevance of the models. Can you just unpack that a little bit for us? Can you give us examples of where you're still running the model in a suboptimal basis or opportunities for improved signal capture use or data you're not using, where are sort of the areas of improvement you see from here? And then the second one, when you talk about driving incremental adoption of AI tools for advertisers, what are sort of some of the main gating factors you've encountered to get advertisers to test these tools and how do you think about sort of addressing that throughout '24 and '25? Thanks.\n\nSusan Li: Thanks, Brian. So to your first question, where are there more opportunities for us to leverage and improve our recommendations models to drive engagement. One of the things I would say is historically each of our recommendation products, including reels, in-feed recommendations, et cetera, has had their own AI model. And recently, we've been developing a new model architecture with the aim for it to power multiple recommendations products. We started partially validating this model last year by using it to power Facebook reels and we saw meaningful performance gains 8% to 10% increases in watch time as a result of deploying this. This year, we're actually planning to extend the singular model architecture to recommend content across not just Facebook reels, but also Facebook's video tab as well. So while it's still too early to share specific results, we're optimistic that the new model architecture will unlock increasingly relevant video recommendations over time and if it's successful, we'll explore using it to power other recommendations. An analog exists I would say on the ad side. We've talked a little bit about the new model architecture at Meta Lattice that we deployed last year that consolidates smaller and more specialized models into larger models that can better learn what characteristics improve ad performance across multiple surfaces like feed and reels and multiple types of ads and objectives at the same time and that's driven improved ad performance over the course of 2023 as we deployed it across Facebook and Instagram to support multiple objectives. And over the course of 2024, we expect to further enhance model and performance and include support for even more objectives like web and app and ROAS. So there's a lot of work that we're investing in, in the underlying model architecture for both organic engagement and ads that we expect is going to continue to deliver increasing ads performance over time. The second question you asked was around getting advertisers to test and adopt gen AI tools. There are two flavors of this. The more near term version is around the gen AI ad creative features that we have put into our ads creation tools and it's early, but we're seeing adoption of these features across verticals and different advertiser sizes. In particular, we've seen outsized adoption of image expansion with small businesses and this will remain a big area of focus for us in 2024 and I expect that improvements to our underlying foundation models will enhance the quality of the outputs that are generated and support new features on the roadmap. But right now, we have features supporting text variations, image expansion and background generation and we're continuing to work to make those more performant for advertisers to create more personalized ads at scale. The longer term piece here is around business AIs. We have been testing the ability for businesses to set up AIs for business messaging that represent them in chats with customers starting by supporting shopping use cases such as responding to people asking for more information on a product or its availability. So this is very, very early. We've been testing this with a handful of businesses on Messenger and WhatsApp and we're hearing good feedback with businesses saying that the AIs have saved them significant time while customer -- consumers noted more timely response times. And we're also learning a lot from these tests to make these AIs more performant over time as well. So we'll be expanding these tests over the coming months and we'll continue to take our time here to get it right before we make it more broadly available.\n\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik from Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Shmulik: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess back to that product playbook that we've talked about a few times. With kind of reels now such a large share of kind of time spent on Instagram and Facebook, how do we think about the next leg of kind of monetization growth from here in particular as we kind of get back to kind of shopping on platform or other ways to monetize? Any color there on the roadmap kind of just beyond ad insertion from here? And then, Susan, just on the ad market in particular, previously we heard a lot about kind of Chinese based advertiser contribution. Any color you could share there on kind of how that spend is trending? Thank you.\n\nSusan Li: Sure. Thanks, Mark. So reels revenue continued to grow across Instagram and Facebook in Q1 and that's driven both by higher engagement and increased monetization efficiency through our ads ranking and delivery improvements. And we -- as we mentioned -- we've mentioned before, we don't plan on quantifying the impact from reels going forward, but it remains a positive contributor to overall revenue and we expect that there are going to be opportunities for us to continue improving performance and growing supply. So on the performance improvements, we are investing in ongoing ranking improvements. We're continuing to make ads easier and more intuitive to interact with through work like optimizing call to actions and post click experiences, which are especially important for DR performance. And we're also optimizing ads to feel more native to reels. In Q1, we rolled out our Gen AI image expansion tools across Facebook and Instagram reels after having introduced it to Instagram feeding Q4 and we're seeing again outsized adoption with small businesses. So we're excited about the opportunities to continue making these ads more performant. And even though ads, the reels ad load, sorry, has increased over the last year, it remains lower on a per time basis than both feed and stories. So we're going to continue to look for opportunities to thoughtfully grow it in the future and invest in creative ways to address the structural supply constraints of the reels format being more video heavy, including higher density experiences and formats and increasingly personalizing ad loads, which we think will make sure that we're really putting ads in front of people when they're most likely to be interested and engage with them. The second question you asked was around China. Growth in spend from China advertisers remained strong in Q1. This was driven by online commerce and gaming and it's reflected in our Asia-Pacific advertiser segment, which remained the fastest growing region at 41% year-over-year in Q1. Now we did see strength across other geographies as well, including a six point acceleration in total revenue growth from North America advertisers. So I would say that we aren't quantifying the Q1 contribution from China and we don't have forward-looking expectations to share on quarterly China based ad revenue. But I will say that we are lapping periods of increasingly strong demand over the course of 2024 given the recovery of China based advertisers in 2023 from their prior pandemic driven headwinds.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). Please go ahead.\n\nDouglas Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. Can you just talk about what's changed most in your view in the business and the opportunity now versus three months ago? And is there anything you're more cautious about in revenue in the ad market and is the AI opportunity just even bigger and therefore requiring more investment than expected? And then, Susan, can you also just comment on how you're thinking about that ability to sustain growth rates over the next few quarters as you face tougher comps off of big base of ad dollars? Thanks.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: Yeah. I can speak to the first one. I think we've gotten more optimistic and ambitious on AI. So previously I think that our work in this, I mean, when you were looking at last year, we released Llama 2, we were very excited about the model and thought that, that was going to be the basis to be able to build a number of things that were valuable that integrated into our social products. But now I think we're in a pretty different place. So with the latest models, we're not just building good AI models that are going to be capable of building some new good social and commerce products. I actually think we're in a place where we've shown that we can build leading models and be the leading AI company in the world and that opens up a lot of additional opportunities beyond just ones that are the most obvious ones for us. So this is what I was trying to refer to in my opening remarks where I just view the success that we've seen with the way that Llama 2 and Meta AI have come together as a real validation technically that we have the talent, the data and the ability to scale infrastructure to do leading work here. And with Meta AI, I think that we are on our path to having Meta AI be the most used and best AI assistant in the world, which I think is going to be enormously valuable. So all of that basically encourages me to make sure that we're investing to stay at the leading edge of this and we're doing that at the time when we're also scaling the product before it is making money. So that's the analogy that I was making before which is we've gone through some of those cycles before. But fundamentally I think if you look at the facts of what our team is able to produce, I think our optimism and ambition have just grown quite a bit and I think that this is just going to end up being quite an important set of products for us. It was already going to be. Now I think it has the potential to be even more important.\n\nSusan Li: And I can take that second question, Doug. So we aren't giving full year 2024 guidance and obviously our revenue for the full year will be influenced by many factors, including macro conditions and things that are harder to predict the further out you go. And of course, over the course of 2024, we will also be lapping periods of increasingly strong demand. With that said, we expect to see good opportunities to continue growing engagement across our products driven by the investments we made in AI based content recommendations, our ongoing video work and we also expect that we will continue to drive ads performance gains and continue to make our ads sort of more effective and deliver increasing value to advertisers. One thing I'd share, for example, is that we actually grew conversions at a faster rate than we grew impressions over the course of this quarter. So we're expecting to -- which basically suggests that our conversion rate is growing and is one of the ways in which our ads are becoming more performant. So I feel like there's a lot of opportunity for us both with our organic engagement growth and with continuing to make the ads better and to continue driving more results for advertisers.\n\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Please go ahead.\n\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you. First, on the CapEx, mostly you're kind of talking about an investment cycle here. Is there any way you could kind of use some of the Metaverse spend over into AI? Are they converging and kind of use some of the money from the other areas to kind of fund the AI? And then second, longer term, investors are very focused on returns on capital. Obviously, great returns on CapEx in the past with your margins today. How do we think about the returns on the capital you're spending? How are you thinking about it, I guess, going forward two, three years out? Thank you.\n\nSusan Li: So I would say, well, I can start with the second part and then I'll defer to Mark on the first one. In terms of measuring the ROI on our CapEx investments, we've broadly categorized our AI investments into two buckets. I think of them as sort of core AI work and then strategic bets, which would include Gen AI and the advanced research efforts to support that. And those are just really at different stages as it relates to being able to measure the return and drive revenue for our business. So with our core AI work, we continue to have a very ROI driven approach to investment and we're still seeing strong returns as improvements to both engagement and ad performance have translated into revenue gains. Now the second area, strategic bets is where we are much earlier, Mark has talked about the potential that we believe we have to create significant value for our business in a number of areas, including opportunities to build businesses that don't exist on us today. But we'll need to invest ahead of that opportunity to develop more advanced models and to grow the usage of our products before they drive meaningful revenue. So while there is tremendous long-term potential, we're just much earlier on the return curve than with our core AI work. What I'll say, though, is we're also building our systems in a way that gives us fungibility in how we use our capacity, so we can flex it across different use cases as we identify what are the best opportunities to put that infrastructure toward.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: Sure. And then on the question of shifting resources from other parts of the company, I would say broadly we actually are doing that in a lot of places in terms of shifting resources from other areas, whether it's compute resources or different things in order to advance the AI efforts. For Reality Labs specifically, I mean, I'm still really optimistic about building these new computing platforms long-term. I mentioned in my remarks upfront that one of the bigger areas that we're investing in, in Reality Labs is glasses. We think that that's going to be a really important platform for the future. Our outlook for that I think has improved quite a bit because previously we thought that, that would need to wait until we had these full holographic displays to be a large market. And now we're a lot more focused on the glasses that we're delivering in partnership with Ray-Ban, which I think are going really well. And so that I think has the ability to be a pretty meaningful and growing platform sooner than I would have expected. So it is true that more of the Reality Labs work like I said is sort of focused on the AI goals as well, but I still think that we should focus on building these long term platforms too.\n\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali from Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you very much. Mark with the upcoming ban or sale of TikTok ending to a lot earlier today, how do you think that will impact the US social media landscape in that in particular? And what do you say to people who believe that this is potentially a slippery slope in terms of the government picking up winners and losers? And Susan, how big is Advantage+ in terms of the spend on the platform and just in terms of its impact on overall CPM stabilizing? Thank you very much.\n\nSusan Li: Thanks, Youssef. We've obviously been following the events related to TikTok closely, but at this stage, it is just too early I think to assess its impact or what it would mean for our business. To your second question on Advantage+, we're continuing to see good traction across our Advantage+ portfolio, including both with solutions I mentioned this that automate individual steps of a campaign creation set up as well as ones that automate the full end-to-end process. So on the single step automation, Advantage+ audience, for example, has seen significant growth in adoption since we made it the default audience creation experience for most advertisers in Q4 and that enables advertisers to increase campaign performance by just using audience inputs as a suggestion rather than a hard constraint. And based on tests that we've ran, campaigns using Advantage+ audience targeting saw on average, a 28% decrease in cost per click or per objective compared to using our regular targeting. On the end-to-end automation products like Advantage+ shopping and Advantage+ app campaigns, we're also seeing very strong growth. Mark mentioned the combined revenue flowing through those two has more than doubled since last year and we think there's still significant runway to broaden adoption. So we're trying to enable more conversion types for Advantage+ shopping. In Q1, we began expanding the list of conversions that businesses could optimize for. So previously it only supported purchase events and now we've added 10 additional conversion types and we're continuing to see strong adoption now across verticals. So generally, I would say, we are building a lot more functionality into the Advantage+ tools over time. It's also where a lot of our Gen AI ads creative features have been introduced and where advertisers have the opportunity to experiment with those and we'll keep looking to apply what we learn from these products more broadly to our ads investments over the course of the year.\n\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Gawrelski from Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). Please go ahead.\n\nKen Gawrelski: Thank you very much. As you look out through the coming period of product investment, how should we think about the relationship between Family of Apps revenue and cost growth? Is there any insight you can give us there? And then maybe just one that's a little bit more specific to the G&A growth in 1Q. You called out legal expenses. Just wanted to see if there's anything one time in there that would cause the elevated growth in 1Q. Thank you.\n\nSusan Li: Yeah. On the second part of your question first, so on the G&A side that was really driven by legal expenses. We recognized some accruals in Q1 related to ongoing legal matters and you'll see more detail on that in the 10-Q. On the first part of your question, which is really about sort of the kind of long-term margin profile of Family of Apps, we aren't giving guidance on that per se. But one of the things that we really have been very disciplined about over the course of 2023 and continuing is really operating the business in a very efficiency oriented way. So we're being very disciplined with allocation of new resources. This is a muscle that we really built over 2023 that we believe is important for us to keep carrying forward and I think you'll see us continue to emphasize that especially with the Family of Apps business being at the scale that it is.\n\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays (LON:BARC). Please go ahead.\n\nRoss Sandler: Great. Mark, you partnered with Google and Bing for Meta AI organic search citations. So I guess, stepping back, do you think that Meta AI longer term could bring in search advertising dollars at some point or do you view this as what others are doing where you kind of attach a premium subscription tier once people kind of get going on it? And then the second question is you mentioned that you guys are working on building AI tools for businesses and creators. So just, I guess, how do you see the business model evolving when we all get to this stage of interacting with something like Taylor Swift's custom AI for merchandiser tickets or something like that? How's that going to play out? Thank you.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: All right. So yeah, on the Google and Microsoft partnerships, yeah, I mean, we work with them to have real time information in Meta AI. It's useful. I think it's pretty different from search. We're not working on search ads or anything like that. I think this will end up being a pretty different business. I do think that there will be an ability to have ads and paid content in Meta AI interactions over time as well as people being able to pay for whether it's bigger models or more compute or some of the premium features and things like that, but that's all very early in flushing out. The thing that I actually think is probably the biggest clear opportunity is all the work around business messaging. That's in addition to the stuff that we're already doing, just generate, to increase engagement and ads quality in the apps. But the business messaging thing, I mean, whether it's a creator or one of the 100 plus million businesses on our platform. We basically want to make it very easy for all of these folks to set up an AI to engage with their community for a business that's going to be to be able to do sales and commerce and customer support. And I think it will be similar for creators, although there will be more of a kind of just fun engaging part there. But a lot of creators are on the platform because they see this as a business too, whether they're trying to sell concert tickets or products or whatever it is that their business goal is. And a lot of these folks either aren't advertising as much as they could or in business the business messaging parts I think are still relatively under monetized compared to where they will be. And I think a lot of that is because the cost of engaging with people in messaging is still very high, but AI should bring that down just dramatically for businesses and creators and I think that, that has the potential, that's probably the -- beyond just increasing engagement and increasing the quality of the ads. I think that that's probably one of the nearer term opportunities even though that will -- it's not like a next quarter, the quarter after that scaling thing. But that's not like a five year opportunity either. So I think that is one that I think is going to be pretty exciting to look at. But yeah I mean as Meta AI scales too, I think that that will have its own opportunities to monetize and we'll build that out over time. But like I tried to emphasize, we're in the phase of this where the main goal is getting many hundreds of millions or billions of people to use Meta AI as a core part of what they do. That's the kind of next goal building something that is super valuable. We think this has the potential to be at a very large scale and that's sort of the next step on the journey.\n\nKenneth Dorell: Krista, we have time for one last question.\n\nOperator: And that question comes from the line of Ron Josey from Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nRonald Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Mark, I wanted to follow up on a prior question that you mentioned optimism has grown internally quite a bit just with all the improvements and investments and innovations you're making. And we're seeing that in the experience just for the few days of Meta AI. So can you just talk to us maybe how the 400 billion parameter model just might evolve the experience on Meta or how you think things might change over the next, call it, months, years, et cetera, as maybe messaging becomes a greater focus and things along those lines? So just a vision longer term. Thank you.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: Yeah. I mean, I think that the next phase for a lot of these things are handling more complex tasks and becoming more like agents rather than just chat bots, right? So when I say chat bot, what I mean is, you send it a message and it replies to your message, right? So it's almost like almost a one to one correspondence. Whereas what an agent is going to do is you give it an intent or a goal, then it goes off and probably actually performs many queries on its own in the background in order to help accomplish your goal, whether that goal is researching something online or eventually finding the right thing that you're looking to buy. There's a lot of complexity and sort of different things that I think people don't even realize that they will be able to ask computers to do for them. And I think basically the larger models and then the more advanced future versions that will be smaller as well are just going to enable much more interesting interactions like that. I mean, if you think about this, I mean, even some of the business use cases that we talked about, you don't really just want like a sales or customer support chat bot that can just respond to what you say. If you're a business, you have a goal, right? You're trying to support your customers well and you're trying to position your products in a certain way and encourage people to buy certain things that map to their interests and would they be interested in. And that's more of like a multi-turn interaction, right? So the type of business agent that you're going to be able to enable with just a chat bot is going to be very naive compared to what we're going to have in a year even. But beyond that too is just the reasoning and planning abilities of these things grow to be able to just help guide people through the business process of engaging with whatever your goals are as a creator or a business. So I think that that's going to be extremely powerful. And I think the opportunity is really big. So and on top of that, I think what we've shown now is that we have the ability to build leading models in our company. So I think it makes sense to go for it and we're going to and I think it's going to be a really good long-term investment. But I did just want to spell out on this call today the extent to which we're focusing on this and investing in this for the long-term because that's what we do.\n\nKenneth Dorell: Great. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.\n\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

Meta Platforms has beaten revenue estimates from analysts in six straight quarters.\n\nGuidance from Meta Platforms for the first quarter calls for revenue to be in a range of $34.5 billion to $37.0 billion.\n\nAnalysts expect the company to report earnings per share of $4.32 in the first quarter, compared to $2.20 in last year's first quarter. The company has beaten analysts' estimates for earnings per share in four straight quarters.\n\nRelated Link: Zuckerberg Vs. Musk: Billionaire Battle Sees Meta Platforms Rejoin $1 Trillion Market Cap Club Before Tesla\n\nRoth on META: With Meta Platforms shares up 36% year-to-date, Roth analyst Rohit Kulkarni said there are great expectations for the company's earnings report.\n\nThe analyst, who had a Buy rating and $500 price target, said buyside expectations could be \"overly ambitious\" and he remains cautious.\n\n\"We are marginally cautious heading into 1Q earnings as '24 quarterly revenue cadence under tougher YoY comps, incremental growth drivers, and impact from European regulations are big unresolved debates among investors,\" Kulkarni said.\n\nThe analyst said investors could be expecting a beat and raise quarter from Meta Platforms with revenue higher than $37 billion and guidance for the second quarter to be announced at around $39.5 billion.\n\nKulkarni called European regulations an unknown that is tricky to predict currently.\n\n\"We will monitor developments closely as early enforcement actions become more apparent over the next couple of months.\"\n\nThe analyst said comps get tougher for Meta Platforms in the second quarter and beyond, which could make the stock returning to all-time highs tough.\n\nBenchmark on META: The impact of China-based advertisers and Reels monetization are key areas of topic for Benchmark analyst Mark Zgutowicz.\n\nThe analyst had a Hold rating and no price target on the stock.\n\nView more earnings on META\n\n\"Given China-based advertisers drove nearly 1/3 of Meta's '23 ad growth and our more modest '24E contribution, we assume '24E core (non-China) ad growth accelerates,\" Zgutowicz said.\n\nThe analyst also highlighted Meta's recent increased artificial intelligence capabilities with version 2 of Meta AI rolled out. This includes posing questions to the AI assistant on WhatsApp and Messenger and providing information on posts and videos on Facebook and Instagram.\n\n\"We expect these and other use cases will be elaborated on the call.\"\n\nThe analyst said that the investment in data center and GPU capital could be increased given the new capabilities of artificial intelligence for the company.\n\nJMP on META: The use of artificial intelligence within the Meta family of apps could be the first generative AI experience that some users have, JMP analyst Andrew Boone said.\n\n\"Meta is leaning into high user engagement across its family of apps to create an adjacent service with Meta AI, similar to how it launched short-form video with Reels,\" Boone said.\n\nThe analyst, who has a Market Outperform rating and $550 price target, said the large opportunity for Meta \"is to take share of search queries.\" This could lead to more data to use in personalized ads.\n\nBoone said the new AI could lead to Meta being in an investment cycle for data centers and AI talent.\n\n\"AI unlocks new areas of engagement, data, and monetization.\"\n\nThe analyst said data from Pew Research from February 2024 showed that 23% of U.S. adults have used ChaGPT, which means Meta's AI tools could be the first time many of its users experience generative AI.\n\n\"With AI chats likely more personalized over time as models improve and learn from past interactions, there may be a first mover advantage that Meta can capture.\"\n\nBoone said the opportunity for Meta is additional searches, which has potential for more monetization.\n\nMETA Price Action: Meta shares are up 2.88% to $495.02 on Tuesday versus a 52-week trading range of $207.13 to $531.49. Shares of Meta are up over 130% in the last year.\n\nRead Next: Microsoft, Meta Reveal Limited Edition Meta Quest VR Headset With Game Pass Bundle'\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Meta Platforms Q1 Earnings Preview: 'Marginally Cautious,' AI Opportunity Could Prove 'First Mover Advantage' originally appeared on Benzinga.com", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

AI Costs Rising As Guidance Disappoints.", "body": "Meta stock sank late Wednesday as the Facebook parent company's first-quarter results apparently failed to live up to sky-high expectations. While the company beat consensus expectations for both sales and earnings, Meta Platforms (META) executives gave a lighter-than-expected sales forecast for the current quarter.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta's push to be a leader in generative artificial intelligence is adding to its costs. The Menlo Park, Calif.-based company raised its guidance for total expenses, citing infrastructure investments needed to supports it \"AI road map,\" according to the company's news release. All that contributed up to a more than 16% slide in recent after-hours action on the stock market today.\n\nThe harsh response comes despite Meta clearing a high bar for its first-quarter results. The company said in a news release that it earned $4.71 per share on sales of $36.46 billion for the March-ended quarter. On average, analysts projected Meta would post earnings of $4.32 per share on sales of $36.14 billion, according to FactSet. Sales jumped 27% year over year while earnings increased 114%.\n\nMeta Guidance For Q2 2024\n\nThe negative response for Meta stock could be driven by its projections for the current quarter. Meta guided for sales between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, or $37.75 billion at the midpoint of its range. That was short of the $38.25 billion in sales for the June-ending quarter that analysts were projecting, according to FactSet.\n\nThe midpoint of its range would represent roughly 18% year over year revenue growth for Meta's second quarter, compared to sales growth of 27%, 24.7% and 23.2% in Meta's three previous quarters. But analysts anticipated that Meta's growth rate would slow this year, as the company came up against harder year-over-year comparisons.\n\nBut the rising costs may have caught some investors off guard.\n\nMeta now projects capital expenditures between $35 billion and $40 billion this year, increased from the company's prior range of $30 billion to $37 billion. Meta expects overall expenses for the year to fall between $96 billion and $99 billion, up from a previous given range of $94 billion to $99 billion.\n\nIn a client note Wednesday, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote that \"lighter than expected Q2 revenue guidance and increases in the total expense and capex guides could weigh on the stock.\"\n\nOn a call with analysts Wednesday, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg highlighted that the company released updates to its Meta.ai chatbot and Llama large language model last week.\n\n\"I view the results our teams have achieved here as another key milestone in showing that we have the talent, data and ability to scale infrastructure to build the world's leading AI models and services,\" Zuckerberg said. \"And this leads me to believe that we should invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models and the largest scale AI services in the world.\"\n\nFutures Fall; Meta Dives, Leads 5 Key Earnings Movers\n\nMeta Stock: Technical Ratings\n\nPrior to earnings, Meta fell a half-percent to close at 493.50 in Wednesday trading. Prior to the after-hours slide, shares had gained just under 40% this year and 138% in the past 12 months. Coming into its earnings, Meta stock trailed only Nvidia (NVDA) for the best performance in 2024 among the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that helped power the stock market rally in 2023.\n\nComing into the report, Meta stock had a perfect IBD Composite Rating of 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The score combines five separate proprietary ratings into one rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\n\nLearn How To Time The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy\n\nFind The Best Long-Term Investments With IBD Long-Term Leaders", "source": {"uri": "investors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investor's Business Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ed_carson@investors.com", "name": "Ed Carson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "alexis_garcia@investors.com", "name": "Alexis Garcia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FactSet", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FactSet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_Park,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Menlo Park, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Menlo Park, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Stock-meta-05-adobe.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

In 2020, users spent over 2.5 hours a day on social networks, a figure that has increased every year since measurement began. As a result, businesses continue to shift their advertising and marketing dollars online.\n\nMeta's revenue growth over the last three years has been mediocre, averaging 16.4% annually. This quarter, Meta reported decent 27.3% year-on-year revenue growth, in line with analysts' expectations.\n\nGuidance for the next quarter indicates Meta is expecting revenue to grow 18% year on year to $37.75 billion, improving from the 11% year-on-year increase it recorded in the comparable quarter last year. Ahead of the earnings results, analysts were projecting sales to grow 14.9% over the next 12 months.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense-as long as the price is right.

Click here to claim your Special Free Report on a fallen angel growth story that is already recovering from a setback.\n\nIt was great to see Meta deliver solid revenue, operating profit, and EPS growth this quarter, which beat analysts' estimates. That was driven by more daily active users than expected and 6% year-on-year growth in average ad prices. On the other hand, its revenue guidance for next quarter missed analysts' expectations and it took up its forecasted operating expenses and capital expenditures for the full year. The increased costs are related to the company's AI infrastructure.\n\nDuring the quarter, Meta released its AI assistant, Meta AI. This product was rolled out across its family of apps and is powered by Llama 3, an open-source large language model that is a ChatGPT competitor. The product is quite exciting and we recommend readers to try it out.\n\nOverall, this quarter's print was solid but the weaker expected revenue for next quarter and higher expenses for the full year are spooking investors. The company is down 9.4% on the results and currently trades at $447.52 per share.\n\nMeta may have had a tough quarter, but does that actually create an opportunity to invest right now?

$36.5 billion.\n\nAccording to analyst Debra Williamson of Sonata Insights, Meta's growth is due in particular to its sophisticated advertising tools and the success of \"Reels\", the algorithm-fueled short videos to be scrolled through in succession, copied from TikTok.\n\nIn another potential boost to its business, by the end of the year, Meta could also start selling advertising on Threads, its text message platform similar to X (formerly Twitter).\n\nWith ads on Threads, \"advertisers who are looking to reach audiences during real-time moments will finally have a viable alternative to X,\" said Mike Proulx, vice-president at Forrester.\n\nThe rise in sales and profit continued Meta's rebound of 2023, which came thanks to drastic cost-cutting, including massive layoffs in what Zuckerberg dubbed the \"year of efficiency\" that saw tens of thousands of employees let go after a miserable 2022.\n\nMeta said its global workforce now stood at 69,329, slightly more than last quarter, but down from a peak of more than 87,000 employees in 2022.\n\nBusiness 'humming'\n\nThe company ended last year with record revenues and since then, its share price has been soaring on Wall Street, thanks in particular to enthusiasm for AI with its stock almost tripling last year, and up another 40 percent in 2024.\n\nBut shares for Meta were down sharply in after hours trading on Wall Street on Wednesday, with investors concerned about expenditure creeping back up.\n\n\"For all the recent scrutiny of its effectiveness, Meta's ad business is humming,\" said Max Willens, senior analyst at EMARKETER.\n\n\"It will need to continue that upward momentum in the face of rising costs,\" he added.\n\nAs for the metaverse (mixing real and virtual worlds via high-tech glasses and headsets), which CEO and founder Zuckerberg describes as the future of the internet, the group's dedicated branch once again posted a substantial losses of $3.8 billion, even if this was less than expected.\n\nAnother subject that interests the market is Meta's progress in generative AI, the ChatGPT-style production of text, images and other content, based on a simple query in everyday language.\n\nLast week, Zuckerberg unveiled the latest version of Meta AI, which is now being deployed as a beefed up smart assistant across its apps, which include Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook.\n\n\"This means users just start inherently using Meta AI without the friction of having to download and learn a new app experience,\" said Forrester's Proulx, referring the rival chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude.\n\nThe technology is being rolled out in more than a dozen countries, including Australia, Canada, Singapore and the United States.\n\nThe AI is powered by LLaMA 3, the company's most powerful large language model, which the company makes available to developers as an open-source product to create their own tools.\n\nThe tech giants are locked in a race to emerge as a leader in AI, with Microsoft, thanks to its partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, seen as the frontrunner.\n\nAI is giving a lift to Microsoft's core cloud computing business, a service that Meta does not provide, leaving some doubt over the high costs of deploying the technology.\n\nMeta has fallen behind on AI, but \"thanks to its platforms it has a massive user base to test AI experiments ... and quickly evaluate those its users gravitate towards,\" commented Williamson.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

With the deployment of ChatGPT on multiple Meta platforms, investors' attention was focused on how generative AI will drive the business. Despite its strong revenues, surpassing $12 billion in net and $36.5 billion in the last quarter, slower growth is expected.\n\nWith Meta increasing its investments in AI and the metaverse, Zuckerberg pointed out that investing in new experiences through apps has been profitable in the long term, comparing it to the past success of features like Stories and Reels. However, he warned that becoming leaders in artificial intelligence will be a long-term project that will require several years.\n\nMeta AI, the company's recent chatbot, has been tested by \"tens of millions of people\" since its launch, according to Zuckerberg, with a focus on areas such as the Instagram search box. The executive says that success now depends on whether users adopt this assistant and use it regularly on social media.\n\nTo monetize Meta AI, Zuckerberg is considering options such as expanding business messaging, including ads or paid content in AI interactions, and allowing users to access more advanced AI models through payments.\n\nZuckerberg anticipates that in the next year, Meta AI will improve the quality of ads by better understanding users' purchasing interests. This approach contrasts with OpenAI, which focuses on subscriptions and enterprise approaches, avoiding advertising.\n\nIn addition to AI, Zuckerberg showed enthusiasm for Meta's smart glasses, created in collaboration with Ray-Ban, which have had high demand.

Then he moved onto the metaverse, touting his company's headsets, glasses and operating system. He spent almost the entirety of his opening remarks focused on the many ways Meta loses money.\n\nInvestors weren't into it. Meta shares tumbled as much as 19% in extended trading on Wednesday, wiping out more than $200 billion in market cap. The drop came despite Meta reporting better-than-expected profit and revenue for the first quarter.\n\nZuckerberg appeared ready for the sell-off.\n\n\"I think it's worth calling that out, that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it,\" Zuckerberg said. He cited past efforts like short-video service Reels, Stories and the transition to mobile.\n\nMeta generates 98% of its revenue from digital advertising. But to the extent Zuckerberg talked about ads, he was looking to the future and the ways the company could potentially turn its current investments into ad dollars. In discussing Meta's effort to build a \"leading AI,\" Zuckerberg said, \"There are several ways to build a massive business here including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions.\"\n\nHe spent more time talking about Meta Llama 3, the company's newest large language model, and the recent rollout of Meta AI, the company's answer to OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nZuckerberg then moved onto potential opportunities for expansion within the mixed-reality headset market, like a headset for work or fitness. Meta opened up access to the operating system that powers its Quest headsets on Monday, which Zuckerberg said will help the mixed-reality ecosystem grow faster.\n\nHe also talked up Meta's AR glasses, which he called \"the ideal device for an AI assistant because you can let them see what you see and hear what you hear.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Meta's Reality Labs unit, which houses the company's hardware and software for development of the nascent metaverse, continues to bleed cash. Reality Labs reported sales of $440 million for the first quarter and $3.85 billion in losses. The division's cumulative losses since the end of 2020 topped $45 billion.\n\nZuckerberg has bought himself some time.\n\nMeta's stock price almost tripled last year and, as of Wednesday's close, was up 40% in 2024. It reached a record $527.34 in early April.\n\nAfter a brutal 2022, during which the company lost about two-thirds of its value, Zuckerberg appears to have regained the confidence of Wall Street.\n\nThe driver for the rally has been a cost-cutting plan that Zuckerberg put in place early last year, when he told investors that 2023 would be the \"year of efficiency.\" The company slashed headcount and eliminated unnecessary projects in an effort to become a \"stronger and more nimble organization.\"\n\nZuckerberg said Wednesday that the company will continue to operate efficiently, but that shifting existing resources to investments in AI will \"grow our investment envelope meaningfully.\"\n\nCapital expenditures for 2024 are anticipated to be in the $35 billion to $40 billion range, an increase from a prior forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion \"as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap,\" Meta said.\n\nZuckerberg said he expects to see a \"multiyear investment cycle\" before Meta's AI products will scale into profitable services, but noted that the company has a \"strong track record\" in that department.\n\nMeta CFO Susan Li echoed Zuckerberg's remarks and said the company needs to develop advanced models and scale products before they will drive meaningful revenue.\n\n\"While there is tremendous long-term potential, we're just much earlier on the return curve,\" Li said.\n\nEven before the call began, investors were trimming their holdings. That's because Meta issued a light revenue forecast for the second quarter, overshadowing the first-quarter beat.\n\nAs the stock plunge intensified, Zuckerberg told investors that if they're willing to come along for the ride, they may well be rewarded.\n\n\"Historically, investing to build these new scaled experiences in our apps has been a very good long-term investment for us and for investors who stuck with us and the initial signs are quite positive here too,\" Zuckerberg said. \"But building a leading AI will also be a larger undertaking than the other experiences we've added to our apps and this is likely going to take several years.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashley_capoot@nbcnewyork.com", "name": "Ashley Capoot", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality headset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reality Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Augmented reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially_Responsible", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially Responsible", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Services", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/04/107405795-1713972773743-gettyimages-1975542608-109a8827_foivv0mb.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Recently, in its first-quarter earnings report, the company revealed that its AI plans are costing more than initially anticipated. Meta initially intended an estimated capital expense range of $ 30 to $ 37 billion for its AI plan; however, the company has ended up spending $ 5 billion more, reaching a total cost of between $ 35 and $ 40 billion.\n\nWhile the investment is significant and mainly focused on AI, Meta's latest AI model, Llama 3, has also led its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, to become \"more ambitious and optimistic about AI.\" Zuckerberg is confident that the investment in AI research and product development will yield substantial profits for Meta in the future and will help the company establish itself as a major player in the AI industry. He also plans to invest significantly more in AI over the coming years to build advanced models and large-scale AI services.\n\nDuring a call with analysts, Zuckerberg expressed his optimism about the potential of AI development, stating, \"We've shown that we can build leading models and be the leading AI company in the world. And that opens up a lot of additional opportunities beyond just the most obvious ones for us,\" according to Business Insider.\n\nWhile optimism and costs are high, Zuckerberg also has a plan to monetise Meta's AI capabilities, aiming to create a massive business in the long run. This plan includes three approaches:\n\nThe first way Meta plans to generate AI revenue is through business messaging. Zuckerberg envisions a future where companies use Meta's AI tools for business messaging, including AI-powered chatbots capable of handling complex tasks and solving user problems. Businesses would pay for access to these advanced \"agents\" to improve customer interactions. Zuckerberg believes revenue from this sector is a \"nearer-term opportunity,\" potentially within the next five years.\n\nMeta's core business model revolves around digital advertising, and the second plan to bring revenue through AI is to integrate ads into AI interactions. This plan involves brands paying to have their products or services showcased within AI-generated responses. While this concept is still in its early stages for AI chatbots, it aligns with Meta's existing strategy of placing targeted ads within its social and messaging platforms.\n\nA third avenue for AI monetisation is selling access to AI models as they grow larger and more complex. Currently, Meta offers access to its large language models, such as Llama 3, for free to users and companies below a certain size threshold. In the future, Meta may charge for access to larger models and more computing power, potentially deviating from its current open-source approach.\n\nWhile all these revenue plans are long-term prospects, Zuckerberg is confident that, \"if the technology and products evolve in the way that we hope, each of those will unlock massive amounts of value for people and businesses over time.

impressive 27 per cent, at US$36.5 billion.\n\n\"We estimate that more than 3.2 billion people use at least one of our apps each day and we're seeing healthy growth in the US,\" Mr Zuckerberg, who is also CEO, told analysts on an investor call.\n\nAccording to analyst Debra Williamson of Sonata Insights, Meta's growth is due in particular to its sophisticated advertising tools and the success of \"Reels\", the algorithm-fuelled short videos to be scrolled through in succession, copied from TikTok.\n\nIn another potential boost to its business, by the end of the year, Meta could also start selling advertising on Threads, its text message platform similar to X (formerly Twitter).\n\nWith ads on Threads, \"advertisers who are looking to reach audiences during real-time moments will finally have a viable alternative to X,\" said Forrester vice-president Mike Proulx.\n\nThe rise in sales and profit continued Meta's rebound of 2023, which came thanks to drastic cost-cutting,

69,329, slightly more than last quarter, but down from a peak of more than 87,000 employees in 2022.\n\nThe company ended 2023 with record revenues and since then its share price has been soaring on

the range of US$35 billion to $40 billion increased from a prior range of US$30 billion to $37 billion.\n\nMr Zuckerberg urged investors to be patient as his company made its move into AI,

What's the reason behind investors' dissatisfaction?\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. reported strong first-quarter earnings on April 24, driven by a significant increase in advertising revenue.\n\nHowever, the company's shares took a 14% hit in after-hours trading due to higher-than-expected expenses and weak revenue guidance for the second quarter.\n\nWhy Did Meta Shares Fell?\n\nThe social media giant posted revenue of $36.46 billion, a 27% increase from the same quarter last year, and earnings per share of $4.71. It beats analysts' estimates of $4.32. Net income also doubled to $12.37 billion, driven by an increase in advertising revenue to $35.64 billion.\n\nDespite the strong earnings, Meta's shares fell in after-hours trading due to increased expenses and lower revenue guidance concerns.\n\nThe company raised its expenses forecast for the full year, citing increased investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and infrastructure. Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $35-40 billion, up from previous guidance of $30-37 billion.\n\nMeta's Reality Labs division, which includes its virtual reality and augmented reality efforts, posted revenue of $440 million, but losses widened to $3.85 billion.\n\nAlthough Facebook's parent can raise its shoulders high over improved revenue earnings in Q1, there are still concerns about its stock performance. The company's share price has been volatile in recent months, driven by fears of regulatory scrutiny, competition, and the impact of AI on its business.\n\nMeta Wins in Ads Revenue, Faces AI Competition\n\nMeta's first-quarter earnings report comes as the company faces intense competition in the AI space from Microsoft and Google.\n\nMicrosoft, in particular, has been making significant strides in AI research and development with its Azure OpenAI service and its $10 billion investment in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. Meanwhile, Google has been touting its AI advancements, including its PaLM 2 and Med-PaLM models.\n\nBoth Google and Microsoft have established cloud infrastructure businesses that generate significant revenue, which they can use to offset the costs of developing and deploying AI technology. In contrast, Meta does not have a cloud business and must rely on its traditional advertising model to generate revenue.\n\nHowever, during yesterday's earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg hinted that Meta may explore alternative revenue streams to monetize its AI technology, such as charging for \"compute\" resources. This could provide a new avenue for generating revenue in addition to its traditional advertising business.\n\nAs Meta continues to invest heavily in AI research and development, it will be interesting to watch how it chooses to monetize its AI technology and whether it can find success with a business model different from that of its competitors.", "source": {"uri": "techopedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Techopedia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "franklin_okeke@techopedia.com", "name": "Franklin Okeke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertisement_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertisement film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Augmented reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaLM", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PaLM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.techopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/facebook.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 364, "textEnd": 372}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Reality Labs reported sales of $440 million for the quarter and $3.85 billion in losses, bringing total losses since the end of 2020 to over $45 billion.\n\nAnalysts expected the division to show an operating loss of $4.31 billion for the quarter.\n\nExecutives will discuss the company's results on a call with analysts at 5 p.m. ET.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_users", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Active users"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mixed reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital expenditure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reality Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_revenue_per_user", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Average revenue per user"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-02/240214-Mark-Zuckerberg-ew-140p-907df6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-31", "textStart": 57, "textEnd": 64}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

For example, you can access the AI in Messenger by writing @ and selecting Meta AI.\n\nThe AI can be accessed on Instagram in a similar way.\n\nMeta says Meta AI is also being rolled out on Facebook, allowing people to ask the AI for more information about a post.\n\nHowever, that doesn't seem to be available in Australia just yet.\n\nAdditionally, Meta revealed that American users are getting the first look at a new feature that will create AI images as words are typed.\n\nFor example as you type \"imagine a soccer...\", images will immediately appear and change as you finish the sentence.\n\nThere's no word on when that will be rolled out in Australia.\n\nAbout 22 million people use Facebook in Australia, WhatsApp has about 12 million users and Instagram 12.5 million.\n\nA friendly reminder, you can connect with news.com.au on WhatsApp.\n\nThe new news.com.au WhatsApp channel is a simple and private way to get key updates, and it's free to join.", "source": {"uri":

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares fell 2% and Snap shares fell more than 5%.\n\nMeta said it expects April-June revenue in the range of $36.5 billion-$39 billion, with a midpoint of $37.8 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $38.3 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe company raised its forecast for expenses this year to support investments in new AI products and the computing infrastructure needed to support them.\n\nIt expects 2024 capital expenditure to fall within a range of $30 billion-$40 billion, up from its earlier forecast of $35 billion to $37 billion, it said. It also raised its total expense forecast to $96 billion-$99 billion, from $94 billion to $99 billion.\n\nThe results appeared to temper expectations for Meta's artificial-intelligence investments after a series of smash-hit quarters for the social media giant. Meta enjoyed the biggest one-day gain in market capitalization in Wall Street history after its last quarterly report, when it posted robust results and announced a first-ever dividend.\n\nThe company has been updating its ad-buying products with AI tools and short video formats to boost revenue growth, while also introducing new AI features like a chat assistant to drive engagement on its social media properties.\n\nIt announced last week that it is giving its Meta AI assistant more prominent billing across its suite of apps, meaning it will start to see how popular the product is with users in the second quarter.\n\n\"For all Meta's bold AI plans, it can't afford to take its eye off the nucleus of the business - its core advertising activities,\" said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown (LON:HRGV).\n\nThe company also benefits from regulatory pressures bearing down on its Chinese-owned short video competitor TikTok, which is facing the threat of a U.S. ban.\n\nMeta posted first-quarter revenue of $36.5 billion, roughly in line with expectations of $36.2 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nMeta's daily active people (DAP), a metric it uses to track unique users of any one of its apps Facebook, Instagram, Messenger or WhatsApp in a day, grew 7%.\n\nMeta disclosed only the DAP figure for user growth, a first for the company. It said earlier this year that it would no longer break out numbers for flagship social network Facebook, whose growth has slowed in recent years.", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snap Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Action_Party_(Malaysia)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Action Party (Malaysia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_analyst", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial analyst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/trkd-images/LYNXNPEK3N0V8_M.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

On the other hand, next quarter's revenue guidance of $37.75 billion was less impressive, coming in 1.5% below analysts' estimates. It made a GAAP profit of $4.71 per share, improving from its profit of $2.20 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Meta? Find out in our full research report.\n\n\"The new version of Meta AI with Llama 3 is another step towards building the world's leading AI. We're seeing healthy growth across our apps and we continue making steady progress building the metaverse as well,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO.\n\nFamously founded by Mark Zuckerberg in his Harvard dorm, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) operates a collection of the largest social networks in the world - Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, along with its metaverse focused Facebook Reality Labs.\n\nBusinesses must meet their customers where they are, which over the past decade has come to mean on social networks. In 2020, users spent over 2.5 hours a day on social networks, a figure that has increased every year since measurement began. As a result, businesses continue to shift their advertising and marketing dollars online.\n\nMeta's revenue growth over the last three years has been mediocre, averaging 16.4% annually. This quarter, Meta reported decent 27.3% year-on-year revenue growth, in line with analysts' expectations.\n\nGuidance for the next quarter indicates Meta is expecting revenue to grow 18% year on year to $37.75 billion, improving from the 11% year-on-year increase it recorded in the comparable quarter last year. Ahead of the earnings results, analysts were projecting sales to grow 14.9% over the next 12 months.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we've identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nIt was great to see Meta deliver solid revenue, operating profit, and EPS growth this quarter, which beat analysts' estimates. That was driven by more daily active users than expected and 6% year-on-year growth in average ad prices. On the other hand, its revenue guidance for next quarter missed analysts' expectations and it took up its forecasted operating expenses and capital expenditures for the full year. The increased costs are related to the company's AI infrastructure.\n\nDuring the quarter, Meta released its AI assistant, Meta AI. This product was rolled out across its family of apps and is powered by Llama 3, an open-source large language model that is a ChatGPT competitor. The product is quite exciting and we recommend readers to try it out.\n\nOverall, this quarter's print was solid but the weaker expected revenue for next quarter and higher expenses for the full year are spooking investors. The company is down 9.4% on the results and currently trades at $447.52 per share.\n\nMeta may have had a tough quarter, but does that actually create an opportunity to invest right now?

While the payoffs could be huge, Meta's most recent earnings underscored that building the best tools is costly and will take time.\n\nMeta (META), which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, said Wednesday that first-quarter profit more than doubled year-on-year, while revenue was up 27%. But an increase of as much as $5 billion in projected AI investments -- and the likelihood of further increases in subsequent years -- made shareholders uneasy.\n\n\"The language around spending plans has become bolder once more, and this could be what's spooking markets,\" Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, wrote in a note Thursday.\n\n\"For all Meta's bold AI plans, it can't afford to take its eye off the nucleus of the business -- its core advertising activities... Meta's resources are vast but not infinite, and its digital advertising market share needs defending at all costs,\" she added.\n\nMeta said full-year capital expenditure would be in the range of $35-40 billion -- up from previous guidance of $30-37 billion -- as it continues to accelerate infrastructure investments to support AI.\n\n\"We expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts,\" the company added in a statement.\n\nOn a call with investors, CEO Mark Zuckerberg focused most of his comments on AI. He said Meta wants to be \"the leading AI company in the world\" and \"should invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models.\"\n\nMeta would increase spending \"meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products... On the upside, once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively,\" he added.\n\nWeaker than expected guidance for the current quarter may also be weighing on the stock. Meta has forecast revenue of $36.5-39 billion, versus analyst expectations of $38.2 billion.\n\n\"A slightly lower revenue forecast than anticipated contributed to investor concerns about the company's future performance,\" said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

But that tally missed Wall Street forecasts by around 1.5%.\n\nCoupled with a boost in overall expenses, which were pegged between $96 billion and $99 billion this year, and a capital-spending forecast in the region of $35 billion to $40 billion, and investors' reaction to the newly minted outlook was significant.\n\nMeta shares were marked 14.5% lower in premarket trading to indicate an opening bell price of $421.79. Such a move would still leave the stock with a year-to-date gain of around 20%.\n\nMeta shares once shed $232 billion in a single session, back on Feb. 3 2022, when it warned that privacy changes put in place by Apple (AAPL) would hammer its near-term ad sales forecasts.\n\nRelated: Analysts revise Facebook parent Meta stock price targets before earnings\n\nAnalysts, as well, were quick to revamp their Meta price targets and stock ratings on the back of the changing narrative, which also includes difficult year-on-year revenue comparisons and elevated Federal Reserve interest rates.\n\nBarclays analyst Ross Sandler, who lowered his Meta price target by $30 to $520 a share, called the group's plans an \"Investment Cycle With No Revenue\" in his Thursday report.\n\nCitigroup's Ronald Josey cut his target by $40 to $590.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan, however, affirmed a buy rating on Meta, even as he trimmed his price target by $55 to $500 a share. The analyst noted that faster stock buybacks could soften the blow of a drop in earnings-per-share estimates over the coming quarters.\n\nThe median price target on Meta now sits at $535 a share, down from $550 prior to the April 24 after-the-bell earnings report, with a low of $480 from JP Morgan and a high of $570 from RBC Capital Markets.\n\nAI investments come with big costs\n\nThe key factor in much of the Wall Street commentary was the increase in costs tied to building and monetizing an AI-powered business strategy.\n\n\"Meta's earnings report reaffirmed that AI is a multiyear investment cycle,\" said KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Justin Patterson, who lowered his price target on the group by $80 to $475 a share, following last night's update. He affirmed an overweight rating on the stock.\n\n\"Coupled with tougher comps that are causing revenue to decelerate, we see more concern over 2025 earnings and free cash flow,\" he added.\n\nBut he said that \"while the investment cycle may remain a near-term overhang, we still see Meta as a normalized 10%+ grower with competitive durability.\"\n\nMore AI Stocks:\n\nJMP Securities analyst Andrew Boone agrees, arguing that Meta is \"well positioned to benefit from AI increasing engagement and advertising efficiency\" from its platforms. But he also conceded the \"difficulties of buying a stock in the early stages of an investment cycle.\"\n\n\"With catalysts around new recommendation architecture, generative AI creative tools for advertisers, and Generative AI agents further out, we think growth is sustainable despite more difficult comps,\" Boone said.\n\n\"We are maintaining our market outperform rating, though lowering our price target to $525 from $550.\"\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024", "source": {"uri": "kentucky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexington Herald Leader"},

This is why earlier this year, we listed it as one of the biggest African tech trends to look out for in 2024. And explored some of the challenges, Google is trying to address with AI on the continent. Meta (formerly Facebook) has also become deeply engaged in its AI efforts. The tech company recently launched its new feature, Llama 3, a new AI assistant designed to improve social connections, engage in conversations, and make suggestions. The Meta AI assistant utilizes real-time search results from Bing and Google and has image generation capabilities that enable users to create animations and high-resolution images while typing. It is available at meta.ai. the web version that works similarly to ChatGPT. It has also been integrated into all Meta platforms.\n\nThe Llama 3 was only available in the United States until last week, when Meta made it available in several African Nations- particularly, Ghana, Malawi, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The tech giant plans to expand into additional countries and languages. According to Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, \"With LLaMA 3, Meta AI will now be the most intelligent, freely available assistant.\" However, the enthusiasm around this new feature remains subpar.\n\nRecall that last year, Meta launched Threads. It was meant to be a Twitter clone that Meta launched as a companion to Instagram, the popular photo-sharing network it bought over a decade ago. Threads gained over 50 million users on its first day, signaling that many people were excited about its launch. Unfortunately, Meta's launch of Threads fell short of expectations. Barely a month after its launch, the app's daily active users dropped by 80%. Mainly because users found it limiting and lacking in functionality. This disappointment fueled a lower bar for future features and products from Meta.\n\nHowever, the lukewarm reception for Llama 3 can't be solely attributed to the failed Threads app. In 2022, Meta also garnered immense hype for its grand vision for the Metaverse, a fully immersive virtual world. The tech giant rebranded from Facebook to Meta - a new name to focus on building the metaverse. The hype surrounding the Metaverse created unrealistic expectations about its immediate applicability and benefits for users, especially in developing regions like Africa. There were conversations about the potential applications of the Metaverse in areas like education, work, and entertainment, but lacked concrete implementation plans.\n\nNevertheless, Meta might be taking a different approach with this AI product. For one, instead of focusing on making it a stand-alone app, the tech giant is taking the integrated approach. Popular multimedia instant messaging app, Snapchat used the same approach. Last year, Snapchat successfully rolled out \"My AI\", its ChatGPT-powered AI chatbot. This integration had a profound impact on user engagement. As of January 2024, Snapchat's subscription reached 7 million paying users, up by 2 million since September 2023.\n\nMeta has also been more transparent about the capabilities and limitations of the new feature compared to the initial hype surrounding Threads. Meta's AI has several features designed to enhance user experience across Meta's platforms. The AI assistant utilizes real-time search results to provide users with additional context and information about their Facebook feeds. This can facilitate more informed discussions and deeper engagement. It also fuels creativity with image-generation capabilities. On WhatsApp, the AI can generate high-quality images with improved text inclusion, as well as provide useful prompts for image changes. Users can access Meta AI while scrolling through their Facebook feeds, allowing them to request more information about a specific post.\n\nAfrica, (like most parts of the world) is rapidly embracing AI. In 2022, African startups attracted over $1 billion in venture capital funding for AI-related ventures. Africa also boasts a significant talent pool for AI development, with over 40% of Africa's population under the age of 15. Countries like Nigeria, Rwanda, Kenya, and South Africa have established national AI strategies and are investing in research and development initiatives. Last year, Nigeria took significant steps in inviting scientists of Nigerian heritage and renowned global experts to collaborate on the formulation of its National Artificial Intelligence Strategy.\n\nMeta's AI also has an opportunity to stand out among African users. Facebook is the leading social media platform in Africa in terms of market share. Meta has more than 2 billion active daily users, with about 271 million Facebook users and a projected growth to over 377 million by 2025. Many people utilize WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram to create content and promote their businesses. Meta can also tailor its AI to address issues relevant to African users. This could be anything from language support for local dialects to solutions for information scarcity. Last month, Meta announced its plans to launch monetization features for content creators in Nigeria and Kenya, in June 2024. Its new AI feature represents another opportunity to show they've listened to user feedback and can create a valuable tool for its African market.", "source": {"uri": "venturesafrica.com", "dataType":

but costs of AI cause worry", "body": "Facebook-owner Meta on Wednesday said its quarterly profits soared last quarter, but worries about the cost of artificial intelligence saw its share price take a hit on Wall Street.\n\nThe company founded by Mark Zuckerberg said that net profit in the January to March period rose to $12.4 billion with total revenue, mainly from selling ads, up an impressive 27 percent, at $36.5 billion.\n\n\"We estimate that more than 3.2 billion people use at least one of our apps each day and we're seeing healthy growth in the US,\" Zuckerberg, who is also CEO, told analysts on an investor call.\n\nAccording to analyst Debra Williamson of Sonata Insights, Meta's growth is due in particular to its sophisticated advertising tools and the success of \"Reels\", the algorithm-fueled short videos to be scrolled through in succession, copied from TikTok.\n\nIn another potential boost to its business, by the end of the year, Meta could also start selling advertising on Threads, its text message platform similar to X (formerly Twitter).\n\nWith ads on Threads, \"advertisers who are looking to reach audiences during real-time moments will finally have a viable alternative to X,\" said Mike Proulx, vice-president at Forrester.\n\nThe rise in sales and profit continued Meta's rebound of 2023, which came thanks to drastic cost-cutting, including massive layoffs in what Zuckerberg dubbed the \"year of efficiency\" that saw tens of thousands of employees let go after a miserable 2022.\n\nMeta said its global workforce now stood at 69,329, slightly more than last quarter, but down from a peak of more than 87,000 employees in 2022.\n\n- 'Several years' -\n\nThe company ended last year with record revenues and since then its share price has been soaring on Wall Street, thanks in particular to enthusiasm for AI with its stock almost tripling last year, and up another 40 percent in 2024.\n\nBut shares for Meta were down nearly 17 percent in after hours trading on Wednesday, with investors concerned by signs that expenditure was creeping back up.\n\nMore from this section The Icon Returns: Discover the All-New 2024 Land Cruiser Honda to build major EV plant in Canada: govt source World's oldest bird who lost mate now courting new partners\n\nBecause of investments in AI, Meta said it anticipated full year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of 35 to $40 billion increased from a prior range of 30 to $37 billion.\n\nZuckerberg urged investors to be patient as his company made its move into AI, acknowledging that unrolling new products before they made money had \"historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock.\"\n\n\"Building a leading AI will...be a larger undertaking than the other experiences we've added to our apps and this is likely going to take several years,\" he added.\n\nLast week, Zuckerberg unveiled the latest version of Meta AI, which is now being deployed as a beefed up smart assistant across its apps, which include Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook.\n\nMeta's latest technology is being rolled out in more than a dozen English-speaking countries, including Australia, Canada, Singapore and the United States.\n\nThe AI is powered by LLaMA 3, the company's most powerful large language model, which the company makes available to developers as an open-source product to create their own tools.\n\nThe tech giants are locked in a race to become AI leader, with Microsoft, thanks to its partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, seen as the frontrunner.\n\nAI is giving a lift to Microsoft's core cloud computing business, a service that Meta does not provide, which creates added worry about the high costs of deploying the technology at the company.\n\nAs for the metaverse (mixing real and virtual worlds via high-tech glasses and headsets), which Zuckerberg describes as the future of the internet, the group's dedicated branch once again posted a substantial losses of $3.8 billion, even if this was less than expected.\n\nZuckerberg said the partnership with Ray-Ban on making VR glasses was \"going really well\" and that the company remained confident about the future the sector.\n\narp/dw", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julie_jammot@reformer.com", "name":

Li said Meta also continues to expect its Reality Labs division to report increased year-over-year operating losses as the company builds out its various AR and VR efforts.\n\nMeta reported earnings per share of $4.71 in the quarter on revenue of $36.46 billion. Wall Street was anticipating EPS of $4.30 on revenue of $36.12 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nMeta stock has been on a tear, climbing 131% over the last 12 months and more than 39% year to date. That's far better than chief rival Google (GOOG, GOOGL) which is up 50% in the last 12 months and 13% year to date.\n\nWhile part of Meta's stock performance has to do with a recovery in the digital advertising market, the company's stock price truly rocketed higher last quarter after the social media company announced it was initiating a $0.50 per share dividend and increased its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion.\n\nDespite the underwhelming Q2 forecast, Meta has a number of positives going its way, including its emergence as a potential early winner in the AI space, with the technology set to improve Meta's overall advertising capabilities.\n\nMeta has made a series of announcements regarding its AI efforts in recent months, including debuting its Meta AI chatbot and Llama 3 large language model on April 18. The chatbot, however, has already garnered controversy after it joined a private Facebook group for mothers in Manhattan and claimed to have a child of its own, 404 Media reported.\n\nOn the metaverse front, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced on Monday that Meta will make its Horizon operating system for headsets open source, allowing third-party companies like Lenovo and Microsoft to use it to build their own devices using the software. The idea is to bring more headsets to market while increasing Meta's reach in the AR/VR space.\n\nThe company also stands to benefit significantly if Congress's TikTok ban, which President Biden signed into law on Wednesday, survives legal challenges. If the app is locked out of the US, it stands to reason that users and creators would turn to rival platforms like Instagram to scratch their social media itches.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

But reaping the financial rewards is taking longer than expected. Meta's announcement that it is spending more on AI while profitability remains a long way off has spooked investors, and other companies are feeling the same pressure.\n\nMeta said that it would be spending billions of dollars more on its AI efforts, raising expenditure forecasts in this area from $30 - 37 billion to $34 - 40 billion for the year. It cited heavy investment in AI infrastructure such as data centers, chip designs, and research and development for the increase. Meta also predicted that revenue for the current quarter would be lower than expected.\n\nDuring an earnings call with investors, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that profitability from generative AI will take years, but asked for patience. \"Smart investors see that the product is scaling and that there is a clear monetizable opportunity there even before the revenue materializes,\" he said. Zuckerberg also pointed to the energy costs of generative AI for Meta's higher spending.\n\nZuckerberg has experience when it comes to assuring investors that new tech costing the company a fortune will eventually pay off. Meta's Reality Labs, the VR/AR business responsible for its metaverse ambitions, has hemorrhaged more than $42 billion since the end of 2020, but Zuckerberg continues to insist that the metaverse will make billions or even trillions of dollars after 2030.\n\nMeta's not the only one spending more on AI. New Street Research analysts predict Google parent Alphabet will see its full-year capital expenses increase to about $45.9 billion, up from previous estimates of $42.7 billion, partly as a result on spending in this field, writes Reuters.\n\nMicrosoft has also spent billions in this area, including the more than $10 billion investing in OpenAI. Like Alphabet, Microsoft said earlier this year that it expects its AI-related costs to keep rising.\n\nDespite Meta's income growing 27% YoY in the first quarter to $36.5 billion, beating Wall Street's predictions, and profit more than doubling to $12.4 billion, the high spending and lower-than-expected revenue for the current quarter saw the company's stock crash 16%. Microsoft is down 2%, Alphabet fell 3%, and Nvidia was down 1.4% as a result.\n\nMeta AI assistant was pushed out across the company's suite of apps last week. It's currently free to use, but Meta believes there are plenty of ways to monetize the feature, such as enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute. Zuckerberg also believes AI will improve app engagement, leading to more ad money.

in first quarter", "body": "Facebook-owner Meta on Wednesday said its quarterly profits soared last quarter as the company continues to see stellar ad growth across its family of world-leading social media apps.\n\nThe company founded by Mark Zuckerberg said that net profit in the January to March period rose to $12.4 billion with total revenue, mainly from selling ads, up an impressive 27 percent, at $36.5 billion.\n\nAccording to analyst Debra Williamson of Sonata Insights, Meta's growth is due in particular to its sophisticated advertising tools and the success of \"Reels\", the algorithm-fueled short videos to be scrolled through in succession, copied from TikTok.\n\nIn another potential boost to its business, by the end of the year, Meta could also start selling advertising on Threads, its text message platform similar to X (formerly Twitter).\n\nWith ads on Threads, \"advertisers who are looking to reach audiences during real-time moments will finally have a viable alternative to X,\" said Mike Proulx, vice-president at Forrester.\n\nThe rise in sales and profit continued Meta's rebound of 2023, which came thanks to drastic cost-cutting, including massive layoffs in what Zuckerberg dubbed the \"year of efficiency\" that saw tens of thousands of employees let go after a miserable 2022.\n\nMeta said its global workforce now stood at 69,329, slightly more than last quarter, but down from a peak of more than 87,000 employees in 2022.\n\n- Business 'humming' -\n\nThe company ended last year with record revenues and since then, its share price has been soaring on Wall Street, thanks in particular to enthusiasm for AI with its stock almost tripling last year, and up another 40 percent in 2024.\n\nBut shares for Meta were down sharply in after hours trading on Wall Street on Wednesday, with investors concerned about expenditure creeping back up.\n\n\"For all the recent scrutiny of its effectiveness, Meta's ad business is humming,\" said Max Willens, senior analyst at EMARKETER.\n\nMore from this section Women's prison hosts Vatican's Venice Biennale show Head of UN agency for Palestinians urges probe into staff killings US markets rise for second straight day as sentiment improves\n\n\"It will need to continue that upward momentum in the face of rising costs,\" he added.\n\nAs for the metaverse (mixing real and virtual worlds via high-tech glasses and headsets), which CEO and founder Zuckerberg describes as the future of the internet, the group's dedicated branch once again posted a substantial losses of $3.8 billion, even if this was less than expected.\n\nAnother subject that interests the market is Meta's progress in generative AI, the ChatGPT-style production of text, images and other content, based on a simple query in everyday language.\n\nLast week, Zuckerberg unveiled the latest version of Meta AI, which is now being deployed as a beefed up smart assistant across its apps, which include Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook.\n\n\"This means users just start inherently using Meta AI without the friction of having to download and learn a new app experience,\" said Forrester's Proulx, referring the rival chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude.\n\nThe technology is being rolled out in more than a dozen countries, including Australia, Canada, Singapore and the United States.\n\nThe AI is powered by LLaMA 3, the company's most powerful large language model, which the company makes available to developers as an open-source product to create their own tools.\n\nThe tech giants are locked in a race to emerge as a leader in AI, with Microsoft, thanks to its partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, seen as the frontrunner.\n\nAI is giving a lift to Microsoft's core cloud computing business, a service that Meta does not provide, leaving some doubt over the high costs of deploying the technology.\n\nMeta has fallen behind on AI, but \"thanks to its platforms it has a massive user base to test AI experiments ... and quickly evaluate those its users gravitate towards,\" commented Williamson.\n\narp/bgs", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"},

The declines accelerated during the earnings call, and the stock was down 15.4% at $417.60 at around 7:30 p.m. ET.\n\nThe CEO offered investors an update on how Meta uses its AI tech in its ranking and recommendation engines for its platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.\n\n\"About 30% of the posts on Facebook feeds are delivered by our AI recommendation system. That's up to 2x over the last couple of years, and for the first time ever more than 50% of the content that people see on Instagram is now AI recommended,\" Zuckerberg reported.\n\nHe explained that the AI recommendation system improves engagement and in turn increases the opportunity that the platform has to deliver ads and \"deliver more value\" to advertisers.\n\nMeta Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Susan Lee noted that advertisers benefit from the company's AI tech through the recommendation engine as well as the GenAI features offered in its Ad Manager. She added that the company is in the early stages of testing AI agents that businesses could use on Messenger and WhatsApp to communicate with customers.\n\nZuckerberg provided investors with a brief update about its new AI assistant, saying that initial feedback is \"very positive.\"\n\nMeta launched MetaAI, powered by its latest AI model, Llama 3, a week ahead of earnings. The new AI assistant, which is integrated into Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, could help Meta better compete with Microsoft-backed (MSFT) OpenAI's ChatGPT and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Gemini chatbot.\n\n\"The initial rollout of MetaAI is going well\" as \"tens of millions of people have already tried it,\" Zuckerberg said, adding that a lot of the feedback the company has received about the AI assistant is to expand its regional availability.\n\nHe added that the company \"believe[s] that MetaAI with Llama 3 is now the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use.\"\n\nZuckerberg touched on the company's push for openness in AI and virtual reality systems.\n\nWhen talking about how the company is improving its AI model training, Zuckerberg noted that \"some improvements will come from the open source community,\" and added that \"improving cost efficiency is one of the main areas that [he] expect[s] that open sourcing will help.\"\n\nMeta has been vocal in its support for an \"open ecosystem\" to promote safety and transparency. While promoting the open-source approach doesn't translate to direct gains for Meta, it could help the company gain influence and better compete with leading makers of closed AI models, including Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Amazon-backed (AMZN) Anthropic, and Google parent company Alphabet.\n\nHe also said that \"a similar open ecosystem approach will help [Meta] expand the virtual and mixed reality headset market over time as well.\"", "source": {"uri": "investopedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investopedia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recommender system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open source model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality headset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mixed reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/HD2nacGweW-cWXryqsmdUT8NmZI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-16936371881-97673d8cc083454fb8c9c2f33b637611.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

This choice is now becoming a strategic milestone in enterprise building, with the aim of improving digital integration and hand tool availability worldwide.\n\nBroadening horizons\n\nChats such as Nigeria will now be available in Ghana, South Africa, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, with Meta thus extending its footprint across Africa. Our expansion also includes additional countries outside the continent, such as Canada, Australia, Jamaica, New Zealand, Pakistan, and Singapore.\n\nThe service is initially in English since it is all about improving users' experience by offering a plethora of creative, productive, and simple information-capturing tools to be used directly within Facebook's core of services apps. By employing the high-performance Meta Llama 3 tech stack, Meta AI promotes itself as a highly sophisticated instrument compatible with the user's routine availability and other daily digital activities.\n\nThe statement assumes that this is only a preliminary phase of delivering brand-new AI features to the world population. When Meta AI was first introduced at last year's Connect event, it turned into a really powerful platform with many functions end users can use without much effort.\n\nEnhancing App Performance with Meta AI\n\nMeta's blog post announces that the AI service can be used between apps and will boost the apps' performance by letting users search, chat, and discover personalized feeds without leaving the app. The integration is proposed to be seamless in that the AI uses current information instantly and can make adjustments depending on the user's input and situations. For the next couple of years, our primary concern is to expand our product portfolio with products that cater to a wide range of potential customers.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, expressed strong excitement about this enlargement. He said that the technology could supply everyone with top-notch AI and make their interaction even more fun by showing existing news and creative tools in real-time. Smooth photo animation and AI proficiency in generating top-quality pictures in real time are some of the key features that make this AI unique.\n\nExpanding global access to innovative AI tools\n\nThe Llama-3 AI model, which is the basis of Meta AI, will be released as public code. Regarding Zuckerberg's declaration, it was essential to stress the new Meta AI commitment to innovation. In this way, this opportunity is open to various majors, such as wiring and its uses for homes and businesses, cabling from industrial machinery to developed tools, and data transfer.\n\nThe Meta AI, Meta Platforms, has also introduced this service in different countries, symbolizing its rising efforts to ensure that social media and digital platforms advance beyond what people have envisioned. Meta is planning to use technology to make widely accessible powerful AI tools that assist user interaction across its global network so that machines are not only the tools of interaction but also a marshaling implement for a greater community and productivity. Expansion is obviously evidence of Meta's strategic priority to link users deeper with the company's platforms; thus, the platforms have become a necessity for daily digital interactions.", "source":

The drop came after Mark Zuckerberg spent his earnings call hyping the company's future in artificial intelligence (AI) and the metaverse, projects that currently generate significant losses.\n\nInvestors were unimpressed. Meta's stock price tumbled nearly 20% in after-hours trading, wiping out over $200 billion in market value. This volatility wasn't a surprise to Zuckerberg, who pointed to similar dips during past product rollouts like Reels and mobile integration.\n\nMeta relies heavily on ad revenue, and Zuckerberg hinted at future monetization opportunities within AI. He discussed integrating ads into AI interactions and building a \"leading AI\" for business messaging. He also highlighted Meta Llama 3, their latest large language model, and the recent launch of Meta AI.\n\nBeyond AI, Zuckerberg sees potential in the mixed reality headset market, proposing work and fitness-oriented devices. He also touted their AR glasses as ideal for AI assistants. However, Meta's Reality Labs, the unit responsible for metaverse hardware and software, remains a financial black hole.\n\nDespite these losses, Zuckerberg appears to have regained some investor confidence. Meta's stock price tripled in 2023 thanks to aggressive cost-cutting measures. While the company will continue to focus on efficiency, Zuckerberg plans to significantly increase investments in AI. He anticipates a \"multiyear investment cycle\" before profitability, but remains confident in Meta's long-term prospects.\n\nCFO Susan Li echoed these sentiments, stressing the need for long-term development before AI products become revenue drivers. Investors, however, seemed wary. Meta's conservative Q2 revenue forecast overshadowed the Q1 beat, leading to pre-call stock trimming.\n\nAs the sell-off intensified, Zuckerberg attempted to reassure investors. He cited past successes with new product integrations and expressed optimism about early signs with AI. However, he acknowledged the greater scale and extended timeline for building a leading AI compared to previous ventures.", "source": {"uri": "wonderfulengineering.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wonderful Engineering"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shaheer_shahzad@wonderfulengineering.com", "name": "Shaheer Shahzad", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality headset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mixed reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Augmented reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Strategic", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Strategic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Small_Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Small Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://wonderfulengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1-36.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

While the payoffs could be huge, Meta's most recent earnings underscored that building the best tools is costly and will take time.\n\nMeta (META), which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, said Wednesday that first-quarter profit more than doubled year-on-year, while revenue was up 27%. But an increase of as much as $5 billion in projected AI investments -- and the likelihood of further increases in subsequent years -- made shareholders uneasy.\n\n\"The language around spending plans has become bolder once more, and this could be what's spooking markets,\" Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, wrote in a note Thursday.\n\n\"For all Meta's bold AI plans, it can't afford to take its eye off the nucleus of the business -- its core advertising activities... Meta's resources are vast but not infinite, and its digital advertising market share needs defending at all costs,\" she added.\n\nMeta said full-year capital expenditure would be in the range of $35-40 billion -- up from previous guidance of $30-37 billion -- as it continues to accelerate infrastructure investments to support AI.\n\n\"We expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts,\" the company added in a statement.\n\nOn a call with investors, CEO Mark Zuckerberg focused most of his comments on AI. He said Meta wants to be \"the leading AI company in the world\" and \"should invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models.\"\n\nMeta would increase spending \"meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products... On the upside, once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively,\" he added.\n\nWeaker than expected guidance for the current quarter may also be weighing on the stock. Meta has forecast revenue of $36.5-39 billion, versus analyst expectations of $38.2 billion.\n\n\"A slightly lower revenue forecast than anticipated contributed to investor concerns about the company's future performance,\" said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

But that tally missed Wall Street forecasts by around 1.5%.\n\nCoupled with a boost in overall expenses, which were pegged between $96 billion and $99 billion this year, and a capital-spending forecast in the region of $35 billion to $40 billion, and investors' reaction to the newly minted outlook was significant.\n\nMeta shares were marked 16% lower in premarket trading to indicate an opening bell price of $415.38 each, a move would still leave the stock with a year-to-date gain of around 17.4%.\n\nMeta shares once shed $232 billion in a single session, back on Feb. 3 2022, when it warned that privacy changes put in place by Apple (AAPL) would hammer its near-term ad sales forecasts.\n\nRelated: Analysts revise Facebook parent Meta stock price targets before earnings\n\nIntro subscription only $1.99\n\nAnalysts, as well, were quick to revamp their Meta price targets and stock ratings on the back of the changing narrative, which also includes difficult year-on-year revenue comparisons and elevated Federal Reserve interest rates.\n\nBarclays analyst Ross Sandler, who lowered his Meta price target by $30 to $520 a share, called the group's plans an \"Investment Cycle With No Revenue\" in his Thursday report, while Citigroup's Ronald Josey cut his target by $40 to $590.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan, however, affirmed a buy rating on Meta, even as he trimmed his price target by $55 to $500 a share. The analyst noted that faster stock buybacks could soften the blow of a drop in earnings-per-share estimates over the coming quarters.\n\nThe median price target on Meta now sits at $535 a share, down from $550 prior to the April 24 after-the-bell earnings report, with a low of $480 from JP Morgan and a high of $570 from RBC Capital Markets.\n\nAI investments come with big costs\n\nThe key factor in much of the Wall Street commentary was the increase in costs tied to building and monetizing an AI-powered business strategy.\n\n\"Meta's earnings report reaffirmed that AI is a multiyear investment cycle,\" said KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Justin Patterson, who lowered his price target on the group by $80 to $475 a share, following last night's update. He affirmed an overweight rating on the stock.\n\n\"Coupled with tougher comps that are causing revenue to decelerate, we see more concern over 2025 earnings and free cash flow,\" he added.\n\nBut he said that \"while the investment cycle may remain a near-term overhang, we still see Meta as a normalized 10%+ grower with competitive durability.\"\n\nMore AI Stocks:\n\nAnalyst unveils eye-popping Palantir stock price target after Oracle dealVeteran analyst delivers blunt warning about Nvidia's stockAnalysts revamp Microsoft stock price target amid OpenAI reports\n\nJMP Securities analyst Andrew Boone agrees, arguing that Meta is \"well positioned to benefit from AI increasing engagement and advertising efficiency\" from its platforms. But he also conceded the \"difficulties of buying a stock in the early stages of an investment cycle.\"\n\n\"With catalysts around new recommendation architecture, generative AI creative tools for advertisers, and Generative AI agents further out, we think growth is sustainable despite more difficult comps,\" Boone said.\n\n\"We are maintaining our market outperform rating, though lowering our price target to $525 from $550.\"\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024\n\nIntro subscription only $1.99 Our journalism needs your support.

His message to Meta's shareholders during the earnings call was to expect some bumpiness and keep their cool.\n\nMark Zuckerberg is ambitious about Meta's AI ability\n\nZuckerberg is now more optimistic about his company's ability to build more capable AI models after the release of Llama 3, which is Meta's latest model. He said 'it makes sense' to go for heavier investments to build more advanced generative AI models and AI services that are going to be at a scale that will be the largest in the world. He said,\n\n\"I actually think we're in a place where we've shown that we can build leading models and be the leading AI company in the world. And that opens up a lot of additional opportunities beyond just the ones that are the most obvious for us.\"\n\nHe also told analysts that his company is not only building better models for developing social and e-commerce products, but they are looking to be the world's top AI firm. But such high ambitions cost money, so that may not be taken well by investors. Because when the last time Zuckerberg spent big funds on metaverse that panicked investors.\n\nHis recent announcement also reflected on the company's stock, which fell nearly 16% in the hours after he shared his investment plans. Zuckerberg said that historically, the company has seen stock volatility at times when they invested in product development and scaling but were not monetizing.\n\nWhere will the money go?\n\nMeta also revealed its capital expenditure plans for AI and said that the spend will be somewhere between $34 billion to $40 billion. Zuckerberg tried to convince Wall Street and reduce the panic as he pointed out that investors know the opportunity and should wait. He also laid out some strategies to make money with generative AI and to develop them as big business for Meta. But he also warned that it will take time, likely several years, according to him.\n\nOne avenue to generate business, he pointed out, is to provide AI tools to other businesses, which could help them in customer interaction. One way to do this is by evolving Meta's AI from just a chatbot to an AI agent that will be able to handle more detailed and complex workloads. This could be an option that they can utilize early for revenue generation, he said.\n\nMeta is also looking to introduce ads in AI interactions or even paid content by companies and brands. Though this is not yet the standard for chatbots to show paid content in their answers, but this might change in the future as Meta's business is primarily selling digital advertisements on its user facing apps. And the company has already deployed AI in its social media content recommendations.\n\nAt the moment, Meta's AI services are free to use, but as the models become larger and more specialized, people and businesses can pay for them to adopt for their commercial needs, as this will provide access to more computing power. Alphabet, the mother company of Google, is also investing big sums in AI development in the coming years, and Microsoft also plans to invest $100 billion to build a data center for AI development with its partner OpenAI, which is already enjoying strong backing from Microsoft.", "source": {"uri": "cryptopolitan.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cryptopolitan"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aamir_sheikh@cryptopolitan.com", "name": "Aamir Sheikh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mint_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mint (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Services", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/22b9c0bc-9b94-48e2-9960-ec1d2f46edbd.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Users scrolling Facebook's feed can use Meta AI to access specific details about a post, with the company describing the AI assistant as the most advanced free offering.\n\n\"Thanks to our latest advances with Meta Llama 3, we believe Meta AI is now the most intelligent AI assistant you can use for free - and it's available in more countries across our apps to help you plan dinner based on what's in your fridge, study for your test and so much more,\" read the announcement.\n\nFurthermore, users can access Meta AI's broad functionalities outside social media platforms via a dedicated website. A cursory look reveals several capabilities ranging from generating suggestions for a weekend getaway to exam preparations and meal prep recommendations.\n\nHowever, the latest version shines for its real-time image-generation qualities, an improvement from its Imagine feature. Generated images appear to be of higher resolutions with users given broad liberties to make seamless edits and text inputs.\n\n\"We're making image generation faster, so you can create images from text in real-time using Meta AI's Imagine feature,\" said Meta. \"You'll see an image appear as you start typing -- and it'll change with every few letters typed, so you can watch Meta AI bring your vision to life.\"\n\nApart from the changes to image generation, other Meta AI features can be accessed by users in select countries outside the United States including English-speaking nations like Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Canada, and Australia, with Meta pledging to expand coverage to a wider audience.\n\nBetting big on AI\n\nMeta's latest moves reflect its lofty ambitions for the metaverse and AI, with the company predicting a massive influx of consumers into the verticals. Already, the company projects in the metaverse have seen it develop a suite of products for fitness and education while scrambling to roll out guidelines for safe AI.\n\nMeta says it will juggle both emerging technologies while targeting the rollout of commercial applications for enterprise and SME users in the coming months. While previous experiments with digital currencies have not gone according to plan, Meta hopes that a measured approach with AI and the metaverse will result in sustained success.\n\nIn order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership -- allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.

But it is more limiting for analysts, as most of the figures take on a different perspective than Meta's traditional reports.\n\nFirst off, on users. Meta's now only sharing overall usage stats, covering its entire 'family' of apps (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp), so we don't get a breakout of Facebook usage specifically.\n\nAnd at present, Meta's Family Daily Active People (DAP) is at 3.24 billion, rising from 3.19 billion in its last report.\n\nInterestingly, Meta also hasn't provided monthly active user numbers, so the only data we have now is on daily active users, across all of its platforms.\n\nThat seems like a step back in terms of transparency, as there's no way to break down the growth, or not, in each app. But Meta's clearly confident that its daily active user numbers are the most indicative of its performance, and a 7% year-over-year increase in daily active people is an indicator of its enduring success.\n\nThough whether that's based on growth on WhatsApp or IG, we don't know, but presumably, WhatsApp, which has been gaining momentum in Western nations, is driving more interest, while Facebook continues to grow in developing markets, as has been the trend.\n\nIn terms of revenue, Meta brought in $36.46 billion for the quarter, a 27% increase year-over-year.\n\nAs you can see in this breakdown, Meta is still heavily reliant on the U.S. market for its ad intake, so while it has been growing in emerging regions, those are not bringing in equivalent income as yet.\n\nBut it bodes well for future opportunities, and unlike Snapchat, which has been seeing solid user growth, but lower revenue increases, Meta is well positioned to be able to capitalize on those opportunities in future, as it continues to solidify its earnings and maximize its business.\n\nMeta has also included a new chart - \"Ad Impressions Delivered\".\n\nLogically, the more users that Meta has, the more ads that it can show, and this chart aims to provide insight as to how its ad business is performing overall, which points to future opportunities for growth, particularly in developing markets.\n\nIt's also interesting from an app usage perspective. WhatsApp and Messenger have fewer ad opportunities, so their relative growth is less valuable in this respect, while Facebook and IG provide more ad exposure. As such, the numbers could be seen as indicative, in some ways, of the relative growth of each platform within each region.\n\nMeta's also shared this overview of \"Family Average Revenue Per Person\", which demonstrates how those ad impressions convert to actual money.\n\nSo essentially, rather than focusing on overall user growth, Meta's trying to refocus the market on its potential opportunities, by showing that its ad business is working to deliver more ads to more people, even in regions which may not be earning as much income for the business.\n\nIn past reports, Meta's \"Average revenue Per User\" chart showed how much it was earning by region, but this more generalized display looks better for the company, by moving away from actual cash intake to growth.\n\nIt's a smart move by Meta to re-frame its metrics, though again, it does reduce the overall insight available into its performance.\n\nAnother key area of focus is its ongoing investment into metaverse-related projects, with its Reality Labs VR division still losing billions each quarter.\n\nAs you can see in this overview, Reality Labs cost Meta $3.8 billion in the period, with sales of VR headsets only seeing marginal growth year-over-year growth.\n\nMeta has noted that sales of its Ray Ban Smart Glasses are increasing, which could be another factor that helps to boost Reality Labs revenue. But right now, the metaverse remains an expensive long-term bet, which is on track to cost Meta another $15 billion in investment in 2024.\n\nMeta spent over $17 billion on VR development in 2023, and has cumulatively invested more than $46 billion into the project since 2021. It remains an expensive, and therefore risky bet, but Meta's overall strong revenue performance will alleviate any scrutiny on this element.\n\nIn terms of future projections, Meta says that its expenditure will continue to rise due to ongoing investment in AI and VR.\n\n\"While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined his plan to acquire 350,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs to build its next-generation AI, which could actually simulate human-like intelligence. The total investment in this project will likely exceed $10 billion this year, and that's aside from its ongoing VR development.\n\nMeta's offset some of these costs by reducing headcount through staff rationalization (Meta says staff levels are down 10% year-over-year). But essentially, Meta's going to be investing a heap, over the next year at least, into longer term bets. So basically, Meta's preparing the market now for a big increase in spending, which will impact its immediate-term outlook.\n\nOverall, it's another good report card for Meta, which shows that its core business is solid, and that it's still seeing relative growth in app usage, even if we can't see which apps, specifically, are getting more attention.\n\nBut the forecast is for turbulence, based on required investment in AI and VR compute.", "source": {"uri": "socialmediatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Social Media Today | A business community for the web's best thinkers on Social Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_hutchinson@socialmediatoday.com", "name": "Andrew Hutchinson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_users", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Active users"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality headset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray-Ban", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ray-Ban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.socialmediatoday.com/imgproxy/1QuJvUeFuWscaymcORcX_5jDj3JKsHpqRNOvthG5AVY/g:ce/rs:fill:770:435:0/bG9jYWw6Ly8vZGl2ZWltYWdlL21ldGFfcTFfMjAyNF8yLnBuZw.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

This is compared to the $28.65bn that it made in the same period last year.\n\nIncome has also nearly doubled, now standing at more than $13.8bn compared to last year's $7.3bn. Meta said that its ad impressions - one of the primary sources of its revenue - was up by 20pc year-on-year across its family of apps.\n\nAt the same time, its global headcount stood at 69,329 as of last month - a decrease of 10pc from the same period last year. This is thanks to multiple rounds of layoffs last year that as Zuckerberg went on a restructuring and right-sizing spree to cut costs.\n\nBut not all costs have proved beneficial for the company - at least not in the short term. Meta shares fell more than 15pc soon after the earnings call because Zuckerberg said expenses are expected to increase across augmented and virtual reality - where it currently doesn't make money.\n\n\"The new version of Meta AI with Llama 3 is another step towards building the world's leading AI,\" he said. \"We're seeing healthy growth across our apps, and we continue making steady progress building the metaverse as well.\"\n\nIts Reality Labs unit - which is responsible for building the metaverse - recorded a $3.85bn operating loss. Just this week, Meta announced it was infusing its Ray-Ban smart glasses with AI and rolling out new functionalities as it makes small but steady progress in AR technology.\n\nEyes on AI\n\nMeta has been making significant investments in AI in general. Mike Proulx, vice-president and research director at Forrester, said the company is emerging as a \"formidable contender\" in the open-source LLM (large language model) race.\n\nBy embedding Meta AI into its family of apps, Proulx argues, Meta is putting its AI capabilities \"front and centre\" to its users - effectively \"bypassing\" the reliance on Google or Bing search while also taking on OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\n\"There's no doubt that Meta is all-in on AI but to achieve its vision, the company has to make big investments in infrastructure. Mark Zuckerberg's 'heads-up' was reminiscent of what he once said about the metaverse, and that didn't exactly go so well,\" he explained.\n\n\"But this is different than Meta's metaverse gamble because AI has real and practical use cases now. The question remains whether Meta can contend in the AI race while maintaining a strong financial position. To do this, expect to see more 'metaverse' resources diverted from Reality Labs to Meta's AI initiatives.\"\n\nMeta also said in its earnings call that monthly active users for Threads - its social media app that is trying to take on Elon Musk's X - is now 150m (up from 130m users in February).\n\nFind out how emerging tech trends are transforming tomorrow with our new podcast, Future Human: The Series.

Many of the world's biggest companies see a vast opportunity resulting from AI and are investing accordingly to stake their claim in the AI revolution. What some investors weren't prepared for, however, is the level of spending necessary to reap the windfall that AI is expected to unleash over the next few years.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, Microsoft (MSFT -2.66%) slumped 3.4%, Amazon (AMZN -2.11%) was off 2.5%, and Alphabet (GOOGL -1.90%) (GOOGL -1.90%) fell 2.2%, as of 1:05 p.m. ET on Thursday.\n\nTo be clear, there was very little company-specific news driving these so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks lower today (more on that in a bit). This supports the conclusion that investors are reacting to the quarterly results reported by Meta Platforms (META -10.54%) and what it means for other big players in the AI space.\n\nMeta Platforms released its first-quarter report after the market closed on Wednesday, and while the results were better than expected, there was one revelation that caught investors off guard.\n\nThe company reported revenue of $36.4 billion, up 27% year over year. Expenses advanced at a more modest pace, growing just 6%. This benefited operating margins, which surged to 38%, up from 25% in the year-ago quarter. This also helped expand Meta's profits, as earnings per share (EPS) of $4.71 soared 114%.\n\nThe results easily surpassed expectations, as analysts' consensus estimates forecast revenue of $36.14 billion and EPS of $4.32. However, it was an update to the company's full-year spending plans that sent the stock reeling.\n\nLike its Magnificent Seven counterparts, Meta has been at the forefront of generative AI, eager to earn its part of the trillions of dollars the technology is expected to generate over the coming decade or so. However, \"there ain't no such thing as a free lunch,\" as the saying goes, and these systems are costly to develop. Not only is there the cost of the AI models themselves to consider, but the data center infrastructure necessary to maintain them.\n\nMeta has already created its large language model Meta AI (Llama) AI system, which is recognized as one of the top AI systems in the world -- but this is just the beginning. As CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted, \"We're investing and scaling a new product, but aren't yet monetizing it.\"\n\nAs a result, Meta increased its full-year forecast for capital expenditures to between $35 billion and $40 billion, up from its previous expectations of $30 billion to $37 billion. Meta said, \"We continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap.\" Meta also expects capital spending to be even higher in 2025 as it works to capture the AI opportunity.\n\nSo what does this have to do with Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet? The common thread that weaves these tech stalwarts together is their AI aspirations, and each of the three has also been spending heavily in order to reap the rewards of AI. Fair-weather investors took Meta's AI announcement as an indication that big tech's AI-induced spending spree will negatively impact results -- but we don't yet have evidence to suggest that's the case.\n\nMicrosoft and Alphabet are scheduled to report their quarterly results after market close today, and Amazon is up next week, so some investors were selling preemptively in the event these stocks might sell off as well. Investors with a long-term outlook, however, will recognize that this is just the beginning of a multiyear profit opportunity, and volatility is the cost of admission.\n\nCompany-specific news for our trio of stocks was decidedly mixed:\n\nInvestors would do well to step back and look at the big picture when it comes to AI. Analysts at Goldman Sachs Research suggest that as AI makes its way into business systems and the rest of society, it could generate as much as $7 trillion over the next 10 years. That's quite a windfall for the companies positioned to participate, which include Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms.\n\nWhen viewed in the context of this significant opportunity, their valuations are compelling. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are selling for 33 times, 23 times, and 22 times forward earnings, respectively, while Amazon is trading for roughly 2 times forward sales. Furthermore, all four stocks have easily outpaced the performance of the S&P 500 over the past five years.\n\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are all industry leaders on the cutting edge of AI.

soar in first quarter", "body": "Facebook-owner Meta on Wednesday said its quarterly profits soared last quarter as the company continues to see stellar ad growth across its family of world-leading social media apps.\n\nThe company founded by Mark Zuckerberg said that net profit in the January to March period rose to $12.4 billion with total revenue, mainly from selling ads, up an impressive 27 percent, at $36.5 billion.\n\nAccording to analyst Debra Williamson of Sonata Insights, Meta's growth is due in particular to its sophisticated advertising tools and the success of \"Reels\", the algorithm-fueled short videos to be scrolled through in succession, copied from TikTok.\n\nIn another potential boost to its business, by the end of the year, Meta could also start selling advertising on Threads, its text message platform similar to X (formerly Twitter).\n\nWith ads on Threads, \"advertisers who are looking to reach audiences during real-time moments will finally have a viable alternative to X,\" said Mike Proulx, vice-president at Forrester.\n\nThe rise in sales and profit continued Meta's rebound of 2023, which came thanks to drastic cost-cutting, including massive layoffs in what Zuckerberg dubbed the \"year of efficiency\" that saw tens of thousands of employees let go after a miserable 2022.\n\nMeta said its global workforce now stood at 69,329, slightly more than last quarter, but down from a peak of more than 87,000 employees in 2022.\n\n- Business 'humming' -\n\nThe company ended last year with record revenues and since then, its share price has been soaring on Wall Street, thanks in particular to enthusiasm for AI with its stock almost tripling last year, and up another 40 percent in 2024.\n\nBut shares for Meta were down sharply in after hours trading on Wall Street on Wednesday, with investors concerned about expenditure creeping back up.\n\n\"For all the recent scrutiny of its effectiveness, Meta's ad business is humming,\" said Max Willens, senior analyst at EMARKETER.\n\n\"It will need to continue that upward momentum in the face of rising costs,\" he added.\n\nAs for the metaverse (mixing real and virtual worlds via high-tech glasses and headsets), which CEO and founder Zuckerberg describes as the future of the internet, the group's dedicated branch once again posted a substantial losses of $3.8 billion, even if this was less than expected.\n\nAnother subject that interests the market is Meta's progress in generative AI, the ChatGPT-style production of text, images and other content, based on a simple query in everyday language.\n\nLast week, Zuckerberg unveiled the latest version of Meta AI, which is now being deployed as a beefed up smart assistant across its apps, which include Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook.\n\n\"This means users just start inherently using Meta AI without the friction of having to download and learn a new app experience,\" said Forrester's Proulx, referring the rival chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude.\n\nThe technology is being rolled out in more than a dozen countries, including Australia, Canada, Singapore and the United States.\n\nThe AI is powered by LLaMA 3, the company's most powerful large language model, which the company makes available to developers as an open-source product to create their own tools.\n\nThe tech giants are locked in a race to emerge as a leader in AI, with Microsoft, thanks to its partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, seen as the frontrunner.\n\nAI is giving a lift to Microsoft's core cloud computing business, a service that Meta does not provide, leaving some doubt over the high costs of deploying the technology.\n\nMeta has fallen behind on AI, but \"thanks to its platforms it has a massive user base to test AI experiments ... and quickly evaluate those its users gravitate towards,\" commented Williamson.\n\narp/bgs\n\nMore from this section\n\nEnergyCAP earns 2024 Environment+Energy Leader Top Product Award

As we continue to challenge this unconstitutional ban, we will continue investing and innovating to ensure TikTok remains a space where Americans of all walks of life can safely come to share their experiences, find joy, and be inspired.\"\n\nOver the weekend, Bloomberg's Jennifer Jacobs, Kurt Wagner and Alex Barinka reported TikTok is preparing to remove a key executive responsible for convincing the U.S. government that the company was doing enough to stave off national security concerns about its connections to China . Erich Andersen has led years-long talks with the American government meant to show that the app was doing enough to prevent China from accessing U.S. users' data or influencing what they see on their feeds. The company is planning for Andersen to exit his current role, according to the people.\n\nOPEN: In a post to its Quest blog, Meta Platforms (META) stated: \"Today we're taking the next step toward our vision for a more open computing platform for the metaverse. We're opening up the operating system powering our Meta Quest devices to third-party hardware makers, giving more choice to consumers and a larger ecosystem for developers to build for. We're working with leading global technology companies to bring this new ecosystem to life and making it even easier for developers to build apps and reach their audiences on the platform. This new hardware ecosystem will run on Meta Horizon OS, the mixed reality operating system that powers our Meta Quest headsets. We chose this name to reflect our vision of a computing platform built around people and connection-and the shared social fabric that makes this possible. Meta Horizon OS combines the core technologies powering today's mixed reality experiences with a suite of features that put social presence at the center of the platform.\"\n\nRWS, a provider of technology-enabled language, content and intellectual property solutions, has joined forces with industry leaders to bridge the gap between rapid advances in AI innovation and policy-making through Meta's Open Loop program. Open Loop is a global program that connects policymakers and technology companies to help develop effective and evidence-based policies around AI and specifically generative AI systems. The program, initiated and supported by Meta, in partnership with Accenture, includes a consortium of technology businesses, academics and civil society representatives.\n\nDRUG INFLUENCERS: Influencers on social media, including Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube (GOOGL), are talking up weight loss drugs, but are not always revealing the risks of taking this type of drug, Peter Loftus and Sara O'Brien of The Wall Street Journal reported. The virtual word-of-mouth has convinced many to take the weight-loss drug, but side effects, such as painful headaches and vomiting, are often omitted or downplayed.\n\nMETA AI: Meta has rolled out a compact version of Llama 3, its latest open-source artificial intelligence model, as well as a new update for its assistant Meta AI. \"Built with Meta Llama 3, Meta AI is one of the world's leading AI assistants, already on your phone, in your pocket for free,\" the company said in a blog post. \"And it's starting to go global with more features. You can use Meta AI on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger to get things done, learn, create and connect with the things that matter to you. We first announced Meta AI at last year's Connect, and now, more people around the world can interact with it in more ways than ever before. We're rolling out Meta AI in English in more than a dozen countries outside of the US. Now, people will have access to Meta AI in Australia, Canada, Ghana, Jamaica, Malawi, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Singapore, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe - and we're just getting started.\"\n\nEDPB WEIGHS IN: The European Data Protection Board says large online platforms like Meta should give users an option to use their services for free without targeted advertising, Reuters' Foo Yun Chee wrote. \"If controllers do opt to charge a fee for access to the 'equivalent alternative', they should give significant consideration to offering an additional alternative. This free alternative should be without behavioural advertising,\" EDPB said after it was asked by national privacy regulators in the Netherlands, Norway and Germany to look into consent or pay models adopted by large online platforms such as Meta.\n\nEARNINGS PREVIEW: Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, Threads and other brands, is scheduled to report first quarter 2024 results after market close on Wednesday, April 24 with a conference call scheduled for 5 pm ET. Last quarter, Meta Platforms reported earnings of $5.33 per share on revenue of $40.11B, both of which beat consensus forecasts. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO, said at the time: \"We had a good quarter as our community and business continue to grow. We've made a lot of progress on our vision for advancing AI and the metaverse.\" The company said at that time that it expected first quarter revenue to be in a range of $34.5B-$37B, versus the then-current consensus of $33.83B. Current consensus EPS and revenue forecasts for Meta's March-end quarter stand at $4.32 and $36.16B, respectively, according to data from Refinitiv. The consensus EPS and revenue forecasts for Meta's June-end quarter reported by Refinitiv stand at $4.76 and $38.29B, respectively. Roth MKM reiterated a Buy rating and $500 price target on Meta heading into the company's Q1 results, though it is also \"marginally cautious\" on the stock following a 36% year-to-date run. The FY24 quarterly revenue cadence under tougher comps, incremental growth drivers, and impact from European regulations are big unresolved debates among investors, the analyst told investors in a research note.\n\nAdditionally, the firm maintained a Neutral rating and $14 price target on Snap (SNAP) but noted that the firm has an \"incremental positive bias\" on the stock heading into Q1 earnings. The company's upside Q2 EBITDA potential is driven by slowing AI/ML infrastructure spend and recent layoffs, while its North America daily active user metric should rise, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Snap's improving brand advertising trends, likely Amazon.com (AMZN) partnership contribution, and Snapchat+ traction also offers greater confidence in the near-term revenue outlook for the company, Roth MKM added.\n\nADDITIONAL ANALYST COMMENTARY: KeyBanc lowered the firm's price target on Pinterest (PINS) to $40 from $48 and backed an Overweight rating on the shares. The firm takes a slightly more cautious stance on Pinterest and Snap, reflecting its view that partnerships and AdTech rebuilds take time to ramp, and that macro adds some noise to Q2 guidance. Even so, KeyBanc maintains that Pinterest is on track for at least 17% revenue growth in 2024, which is arguably better than bears fear.\n\nKeyBanc decreased its price target on Meta to $555 from $575 and reaffirmed an Overweight rating on the shares. The firm says it enters Q1 earnings with some caution as it does not see much thesis changing on prints and sees an upward bias to capex. KeyBanc believes Meta having a wide revenue guidance range around unrest in the Middle East could alarm investors, particularly if Q1's outperformance moderates.\n\nRosenblatt upgraded Zoom Video (ZM) to Buy from Neutral with a $75 price target, citing a refocused channel strategy that has yielded partnerships like Avaya as well as \"compelling\" momentum in Zoom Phone. These factors, as well as a \"healthy\" balance sheet that supports share repurchase generated by better than 30% free cash flow margins, \"collectively signal a favorable outlook for Zoom and make it an attractive opportunity,\" the analyst noted.\n\nOppenheimer analyst Brian Schwartz initiated coverage of Sprout Social (SPT) with an Outperform rating and $76 price target. The analyst sees a pending inflection in the company's net new customer growth. Sprout is well positioned to benefit from a pickup in the second half of 2024 marketing software spending growth and move into customer care, the analyst contended. The firm thinks Sprout Social can sustain an \"upper-echelon\" software-as-a-service industry growth rate and exceed $1B-plus in revenue by 2028 or sooner while increasing operating profitability.",

The Facebook parent company's Meta stock has gained nearly 40% this year and 130% over the past 12 months, pushing its market cap back above $1 trillion.\n\nBut the market has been turbulent in recent weeks. Meta stock slid on Friday as part of a broader tech sell-off. Earnings results on Wednesday could test what has been a quick turnaround story for Mark Zuckerberg's social media giant.\n\n\"We're talking about a pretty significant shift in a relatively short period of time,\" Third Bridge analyst Scott Kessler told Investor's Business Daily. \"From a restructuring, layoffs at the end of 2022 to making 2023 the 'Year of Efficiency,' where we saw the growth rate really accelerate.\"\n\nNow the big question is how Meta can sustain that growth and keep its run going. Here are some of the factors analysts will be watching for in Wednesday's report:\n\nAnalysts project Meta will post sales of $36.14 billion, up 26% from the same period in 2023, according to FactSet. That would mark a fifth straight quarter of revenue growth accelerating. Earnings are projected to rise 95% to $4.32 per share.\n\nOne number to watch: Meta's costs. Meta last week announced the latest version of its large language model, called Llama, as well as upgrades for its Meta.ai chatbot. It is part of a broader generative AI push from Meta. At the same time, the company continues to invest in its metaverse-focused Reality Labs division.\n\nAll that comes with big costs. Meta is redesigning its data centers, creating custom computing chips and buying hundreds of thousands of chips from Nvidia (NVDA) to power its AI ambitions.\n\nIn its fourth quarter report in February, Meta raised the high end of its capital expenditures guidance for 2024 to a range between $30 billion and $37 billion (compared to $30 billion to $35 billion previously). CFO Susan Li told analysts that the company was spending to support its work in AI.\n\nRaising its spending expectations again could raise some eyebrows. But Wall Street might also shrug off that spending, so long as Meta keeps its revenue on the right track.\n\n\"If the company is generating significant growth and exceeding expectations, then it seems the investing public has a greater level of patience with concurrent notable increases in not just capex, but (operating expenses) as well,\" Kessler said.\n\nMeta stock struggled, Kessler added, when spending continued to rise rapidly in 2022 but growth slowed.\n\nOn that note, Meta's advertising business will be closely watched. For its fourth quarter, digital ad sales contributed 97% of Meta's revenue.\n\nFor the first quarter, ad sales are expected to drive 98% of revenue. Analysts project advertising sales will grow 26% to $35.4 billion, according to FactSet.\n\n\"Factors leading to strong growth include the Advantage+ suite of ad products, Reels revenue, and core Facebook, which continues to perform strongly even at 20+ years old,\" wrote Debra Aho Williamson, chief analyst at the research and advisory firm Sonata Insights, in an earnings preview Friday.\n\nBernstein analyst Mark Shmulik said there is a potential risk from a slowdown from advertisers in China, which accounted for about 10% of Meta's total ad sales last year. Further, expectations have \"steadily crept up\" for Meta since its fourth-quarter report in February, Shmulik said in a report Thursday. Investors are now looking for Meta to deliver sales growth toward the top of its guidance for the quarter.\n\nShmulik, like most analysts heading into the report, is confident Meta can meet the high marks. But there are risks that come with heightened expectations. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney pointed to the market response Netflix (NFLX) received last week. The video streaming giant's shares sank 9% on Friday in response to its earnings report the night before, despite results that beat expectations.\n\n\"META is up even more going into its print, though it arguably also has more valuation support,\" Mahaney wrote in a client note on Monday. \"Basic point is that a clear beat-and-raise may be required for Meta to simply maintain its current price level. The bar is high.\"\n\nOn the stock market today, Meta stock is up 2% at 491.84 in morning trades. The IBD Stock Checkup tool shows Meta stock with a Relative Strength Rating of 96 out of a best-possible 99, indicating the stock has outperformed most of the market over the past 12 months.\n\nLearn How To Time The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy\n\nFind The Best Long-Term Investments With IBD Long-Term Leaders", "source": {"uri": "investors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investor's Business Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_deffenbaugh@investors.com", "name": "Ryan Deffenbaugh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor's_Business_Daily", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investor's Business Daily"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capital expenditure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FactSet", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FactSet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Concurrency (computer science)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evercore", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evercore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Stock-Meta-zuckerberg-01-shutt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

The company reported a substantial year-over-year revenue increase of 27%, achieving $36.455 billion, compared to $28.645 billion in the same period last year. This performance not only reflects a robust growth trajectory but also surpasses the analyst's revenue estimate of $36.148 billion for the quarter.\n\nMeta, the world's largest online social network, continues to expand its influence through platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. With nearly 4 billion monthly active users across its family of apps, Meta's primary revenue comes from advertising, constituting over 90% of its total income. This quarter's financial success was further underscored by a significant increase in net income, which soared by 117% to $12.369 billion from $5.709 billion in Q1 2023, comfortably exceeding the estimated $11.320 billion.\n\nMeta's operational efficiency is evident in its increased daily active people (DAP), which rose by 7% year-over-year to 3.24 billion in March 2024. Additionally, ad impressions across its apps grew by 20%, and the average price per ad increased by 6%. These metrics not only demonstrate Meta's robust engagement rates but also its effective monetization strategies.\n\nThe company's income from operations reflected a remarkable improvement, with a 91% increase to $13.818 billion, up from $7.227 billion in the prior year. The operating margin expanded significantly from 25% to 38%, highlighting Meta's enhanced profitability and operational leverage.\n\nMeta's commitment to innovation and growth is evident in its strategic investments, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) and the development of the metaverse. The launch of Meta AI with Llama 3 marks a significant step forward in the company's AI initiatives. Despite a 10% reduction in headcount, Meta's focus on streamlining operations and investing in high-potential areas remains clear.\n\nFor the upcoming quarter, Meta expects total revenue to range between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, considering a 1% headwind from foreign currency impacts. The company also revised its total expense outlook for 2024 to $96-99 billion, up from the previous forecast of $94-99 billion, due to increased infrastructure and legal costs.\n\nMeta's balance sheet remains robust with $58.12 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The company's aggressive capital return program continued with $14.64 billion in share repurchases and $1.27 billion in dividend payments. This reflects Meta's strong cash generation capabilities and commitment to returning value to shareholders.\n\nThe company's capital expenditures for the quarter stood at $6.72 billion, as it continues to invest heavily in infrastructure to support its AI and metaverse initiatives. Looking ahead, Meta plans to further increase its capital expenditures in the range of $35-40 billion for the full year.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc's impressive first quarter results set a positive tone for 2024. With significant revenue and net income growth, alongside strategic investments in AI and the metaverse, Meta is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in the digital landscape. Investors and stakeholders can look forward to continued innovation and growth as the company navigates the dynamic tech environment.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

It was a small beat, as analysts were looking for revenue of $36.1 billion on average, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nBut the Menlo Park, California-based social networking company also projected second quarter sales of $36.5 billion to $39 billion. Analysts expected $38.2 billion. At the same time, Meta raised its expected costs for the year, and now believes capital expenditures will be $35 billion to $40 billion. Earlier this year, it estimated expenses related to things like servers, AI hardware and data centers would be $30 billion to $37 billion.\n\nThe shares tumbled 11 per cent in extended trading. The stock was up 39 per cent so far this year at market close and has been trading near all-time highs for the past month, in part reflecting excitement around AI.\n\nMeta has been spending aggressively to compete on AI against other tech peers like Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc., which is driving some of the increase in spending. The company announced plans for a new $800 million data center in January, and is also developing its own chips for artificial intelligence services. Meta is also working on several new iterations of its large language model, known as Llama, for powering chatbots and other AI services.\n\nIn the previous quarter, Zuckerberg announced a $50 billion stock buyback in addition to the company's first ever quarterly dividend, an effort to placate investors frustrated by the company's aggressive spending on technologies that have yet to pay off. Zuckerberg has spent years plowing money into efforts to build the so-called Metaverse, a virtual world where he hopes people will one day play and work.\n\nReality Labs, the Meta division focused on its futuristic bets, reported a loss of $3.85 billion for the first quarter, roughly the same as a year ago. That division, which also oversees VR headsets and Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, reported an annual loss of more than $16 billion in 2023.\n\nThe company reiterated its broader 2024 spending plans, saying it will shell out $96 billion to $99 billion for the calendar year, up slightly from a low-end target of $94 billion to $99 billion. It previously said that much of that would go toward infrastructure costs in addition to long-term bets on augmented and virtual reality.\n\nMeta's mixed report comes on the same day that President Joe Biden signed a bill into law that would force TikTok's parent company, ByteDance Ltd., to sell the popular video service or face a ban in the U.S. The potential elimination of a major competitor could give a boost to Meta's advertising business since its short-video offering Reels is a clone of TikTok.\n\nMeta reported net income of $12.37 billion for the first quarter, or earnings per share of $4.71, more than double the profit from one year earlier.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Major companies are spending billions upon billions of dollars to develop AI technology, and you would think that their investments have paid off. However, that's not the case, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg just put that into perspective. He stated that Meta will not make money from AI for years.\n\nIt's important to know that many business ventures actually don't make money, even though it seems like they should. For example, Disney+ has over 200 million subscribers. However, the subscription service is not profitable. In fact, it was a $138 million loss at the end of 2023. Even Google's popular series of Pixel devices have been struggling to make a profit over the years.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that many big ventures don't make a profit at the beginning. A lot of the time, they need to progressively gain customers and paying users over time.\n\nMark Zuckerberg recently had a meeting with investors talking about the company's growth and where it's going. One thing we found out is that Meta has been doing pretty well in terms of Revenue. According to the CEO, the company pulled in more than $12 billion last quarter.\n\nBe that as it may, Meta's AI endeavors are a big financial loss at this point. The company is spending a ton of money to develop new AI tools, train models, secure GPUs, Etc. \"The initial signs are quite positive here.\" Zuckerberg said during the call, \"But building the leading AI will... be a larger undertaking than the other experiences we've added to our apps, and this is likely going to take several years.\"\n\nThis is something that should not be a huge surprise. Remember, Microsoft invested $13 billion into OpenAI. However, there's no way that the company has earned $13 billion from Copilot by now.\n\nMark Zuckerberg also said that tens of millions of people have tried out Meta's AI assistant ever since it was widely launched last week. So, people are, at least, interested in some of the AI technology that Meta launched.\n\nHowever, the company is working on ways of monetizing its AI platform. \"There are several ways to build a massive business here, including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions, and enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more computers,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nSo, it's clear that the company is looking for ways of monetizing its AI technology.

Here's why and what to do with it", "body": "The launch of Meta's artificial intelligence tool has generated a wave of confusion among users as the AI bots descended upon the apps and began interacting with real people.\n\nMeta, the company that owns Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, launched its new virtual assistant in Australia and several other countries on Friday, following an initial launch in the United States in 2023.\n\nWhile the tool is built with Meta's improved Llama 3 open-source language model, it ran into some hiccups, which both amused and frustrated users have shared online.\n\nBots were seen posing as humans with made-up life experiences, including one chatbot that joined a mum's group on Facebook to talk about its \"child\", exposing some of the pitfalls and limitations of the technology.\n\nHere are five quick questions on Meta AI and what the technology means for users.\n\nMeta AI is an artificial intelligence tool, used to answer questions in a similar fashion to competitors ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot.\n\nIt is a form of generative AI that is trained on data available online, and can process language to provide intelligent responses in a chat, including follow-up responses that mimic human conversation.\n\nMeta AI appears on social media feeds and search bars on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, where it prompts the user with topics and launches a chat when a query is sent. It has also been spotted participating in conversations in Facebook groups.\n\nSince ChatGPT took the internet by storm in 2022, competition in the AI space has been amping up with all the major tech giants launching their own version.\n\n\"Meta is behind in some respect,\" Stan Karanasios, associate professor at the University of Queensland Business School, told the ABC.\n\n\"Llama 3 is a move that puts Meta's AI tool squarely in competition with those leading AI chatbots.\"\n\nLaunching the AI assistant as an integrated part of Meta's existing social media platforms could be a huge competitive advantage, he said.\n\n\"It is part of a brand that we trust, that we are familiar with, and is already a company that many, many people are very comfortable giving personal data to.\"\n\nThe move opens up generative AI to a new audience, Professor Karanasios said.\n\nAs with Meta's other products, the AI tool is free, which means the users pay with their data, time and and attention.\n\nUnfortunately you can't, despite some users searching high and low for a way to do so.\n\nHowever, if you ask Meta AI for a way to turn the assistant off, it might give you a made up answer, as one X user found out.\n\nYou can still use the search bars normally by typing in words and clicking on the text results that appear below, rather than pressing the blue send icon to the right end of the bar, which will launch an AI chat.\n\nMeta says the tool can be used \"to get things done, learn, create and connect with the things that matter to you\".\n\nLike its competitors, Meta AI can generate text and images based on user prompts for a variety of different uses.\n\nSome of the uses the Meta website recommends its AI for include home decor inspiration, study help and restaurant recommendations.\n\nWhile AI can be helpful in generating ideas, it's good to understand that it's trained on data that exist on the internet, which isn't necessarily fact-checked or up-to-date.\n\nMeta AI has caused confusion by responding to conversations in Facebook groups seemingly unprompted, including by trying to give away nonexistent items in a Buy Nothing forum, the Associated Press reported.\n\nAI technology works by predicting what word is likely to follow next in a sentence, but it doesn't fully understand the context of human conversations.\n\nFacebook's online help page says the AI agent will join a group conversation if tagged, or if someone \"asks a question in a post and no one responds within an hour.\" Group's administrators have the ability to turn it off.\n\nWhat's more, some people are simply not here for having an AI assistant automatically integrated to their familiar social media feeds, with many users voicing frustration online about wanting to use the apps without AI.\n\nTeething problems are expected, especially with Meta's AI reaching such a large audience instantly, Professor Karanasios said.\n\n\"With a little bit of playing around, many people will become familiar and more comfortable with it, and it will become the go-to source of information as well,\" he said.\n\nOver time, he said, Meta AI will become a highly personalised tool that is familiar with a person's needs and tailor its content accordingly.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"},

A disastrous performance of the company was accompanied by its share price having dived by 19% as the investor community was somewhat concerned about the CEO's interest in any other futuristic ventures. Such a burst of events secured the company a $200 billion loss in market capitalization.\n\nEarning call impact\n\nThe Meta shares, which reported a better outcome for the period than projected, lost great value on the stock exchange after the market closed. The investors' attitude was influenced by the futuristic turns that Zuckerburg made looking far ahead, like AI and metaverse, neglecting the up-to-date revenue flows in digital advertising presently. Among the takeaways, the impact of financial performance, as well as strategic shifts on an organization's operations, is also an important consideration.\n\nAlthough digital ads still are its main income source, which provided Meta with 98% of the total earnings, Zuckerberg's speech also divulged AI and new hardware devices like mixed reality headsets and AR glasses as potential income sources in the future. Such a move reflects Meta's effort to continue expanding and exploring new markets and technologies rather than worrying about a reported loss of the Reality Labs unit of over $10 billion.\n\nInvestment strategy\n\nMeta tackled the challenges of 2022, and the company devised a smart cost-cutting strategy that included reducing headcount and expenses.\n\nThis method, however, was successful, as the company's stock popularity multiplied more than three times compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, Meta is scheduled to take on more capital spending on its AI infrastructure, symbolizing that it gives top priority to long-term advancement over short-term profits.\n\nMeta outlook\n\nMeta's repositioning towards AI and building the Metaverse will probably result in a reduction in stock price because of the high cost of the investment made, and the ongoing losses of the department reality labs can discourage investors. Although volatile from a short-run perspective, it may serve favorably for those with a long-term investment horizon. Because of Meta's history of transforming from early-stage investment scenarios to a profitable business, its concentration on innovative technologies seems appealing. It is expected to result in considerable new revenue flows and better positions, which would be, of course, carefully managed.\n\nThe remarks of the Meta platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg concerning AI and the Metaverse which took place during the earnings conference call have led to a dropping reaction in the investor market. As a consequence, the Meta Platforms suffered a large decline of 19% in its stock quotation, which dropped market capitalization to almost $200 billion. While the Q1 financial report stated positive results, investor anxiety came from Zuckerberg's remarks stressing the presentation of futuristic technologies over the main revenue source, which was the digital advertising income.\n\nMeta's portfolio always begins with digital advertising and its strategic engagement with AI and new hardware can be a clear sign of the company's intention to expand its horizon. Although it could be a problem of share market volatility in the early stages, developing new technologies has a long-term perspective and success story of Meta. As Meta chases out its quest for more profitability and growth, responsible leadership will count to realize its vision and long-term objective.", "source": {"uri": "cryptopolitan.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cryptopolitan"}, "authors": [{"uri": "glory_kaburu@cryptopolitan.com", "name": "Glory Kaburu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality headset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mixed reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Augmented reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Venture_Capital", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Venture Capital", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Services", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Default_Meta_Platforms_Stock_Plunges_19_After_Earnings_Call_0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The social media specialist's report included upbeat data about Q1 itself. Revenue and earnings per share (EPS), for instance, both came in ahead of analysts' average forecasts. But it also raised potential issues related to cost control and profitability going forward.\n\nData source: Meta Platforms. Analyst source: FactSet via Xignite. YOY = Year over year.\n\nMeta Platforms, previously known as Facebook, stands at the forefront of social media and technology. It owns a suite of apps that billions globally use to connect, share, and discover. Beyond social media, Meta is diving deep into the development of the metaverse, a virtual realm for users to interact in virtual reality spaces.\n\nMeta's core business still relies heavily on advertising. The sustained growth in ad revenue highlights the robust demand for Meta's advertising solutions. This revenue fuels the company's strategic bets on the metaverse as well as its growing efforts related to artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nDuring the quarter, Meta Platforms made significant strides in enhancing user engagement across its app family. The launch of new AI-driven features and the optimization of ad delivery mechanisms contributed to a noticeable increase in ad impressions (up 20% year over year) and the average price per ad (up 6%). This dual achievement demonstrates Meta's adeptness at both expanding its advertising reach and ensuring the value of its ad inventory grows.\n\nMeta's balance sheet remains strong, with substantial cash flow to support its ambitious projects. Building out a metaverse to help shape the future of digital interaction is one ambitious project Meta is investing heavily in. It's leveraging virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies as part of this effort. However, this venture from its Reality Labs segment has yet to turn a profit, and it generated $3.85 billion in operating losses just in Q1.\n\nEscalating regulatory pressures, particularly in the European Union and the United States, are also pressuring Meta's balance sheet. Total costs and expenses in Q1 were $22.64 billion, an increase of 6% year over year. Addressing these regulatory hurdles is pivotal for maintaining its growth trajectory.\n\nLooking forward, Meta Platforms management expressed a cautiously optimistic outlook but it also guided for increased costs. The heavy emphasis on spending to build out metaverse and AI projects indicates that Meta is not shying away from its long-term visions, despite short-term profitability challenges. Management anticipates full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35 billion to 40 billion, an increase from prior projections of $30 billion to $37 billion in costs. Meta expects capital expenditures will continue to increase in 2025 as it funds some ambitious AI research and product development efforts.\n\nThese strategically vital areas are expected to lay the groundwork for Meta's future growth and market position. Investors and analysts will be watching closely to see how Meta balances these investments with the need for operational efficiency and profitability.\n\nMeta Platforms finds itself at a critical juncture. On one hand, there's the promise of the metaverse and AI reshaping how people connect and interact. On the other, there are present challenges of regulatory scrutiny and the need for substantial investment in these new technologies. Understanding how Meta navigates these waters will be crucial for stakeholders.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_engagement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer engagement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Augmented reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Product development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital expenditure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/774382/facebook-_-image-source_-getty-71217.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 239, "textEnd": 247}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Meta expects Q2 revenue in the range of $36.5 billion to $39 billion, below Wall Street's expectations.\n\nMeta's advertising business, which still accounts for the lion's share of its revenue, had an impressive start to the year. Healthy advertiser demand led to ad pricing growth, while overall impressions jumped and revenue climbed 27%.\n\nThe social media giant has recently seen a windfall as Chinese companies like Shein and Temu ramp up their outreach to U.S. consumers. Finance chief Susan Li stated that the Asia-Pacific region was Meta's fastest-growing in relation to advertising in Q1, up 41% YoY.\n\nReels, a TikTok competitor, has continued to gain traction -- it now makes up 50% of the time people spend on Instagram -- and improve monetization efficiency. With a potential TikTok ban or sale looming, the short-form video portal could attract more ad budgets down the line, though Meta leadership said it was too early to tell what the impact would be. Threads, Meta's answer to X, formerly Twitter, also looks promising with 150 million monthly active users.\n\nThat said, much of the Q1 earnings call centered on Meta's future-facing bets, including money losing projects like the metaverse. Meta's shares sharply dropped Wednesday as that discussion focus and a disappointing Q2 outlook proved off-putting to some investors.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined several ways Meta is putting AI to use, such as a new assistant called Meta AI (which has already stirred controversy), connected sunglasses, creator AIs and a large-language model called Llama 3. AI also increasingly underpins Meta's advertising infrastructure through offerings like the Advantage+ suite of products and an ads-ranking system called Meta Lattice.\n\nThose features have seen strong adoption from brands, executives said. But staying competitive on the AI front will involve hefty spending and it could take several years to realize a market-leading product, Zuckerberg cautioned, echoing his prior outlook on building the metaverse, a bridge between the real and virtual worlds.\n\n\"Realistically, even with shifting many of our existing resources to focus on AI, we'll still grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products,\" the CEO said on the investor call.\n\nThe executive noted that there is strong monetization potential in AI, including in scaling up business messaging, implementing paid ads or content around AI and charging people more to access bigger models. That's a more compelling roadmap at the moment than the one around the metaverse, an ambitious initiative that has consistently bled money.\n\nReality Labs, the Meta division tasked with developing virtual reality tools, saw revenue increase 30% in Q1 on sales of its Quest headset but its operating loss stood at $3.8 billion. Enthusiasm for the metaverse as a concept has withered in the wake of AI, which remains a topic that excites consumers and investors.\n\n\"The question remains whether Meta can contend in the AI race while maintaining a strong financial position,\" said Mike Proulx, vice president and research director at Forrester, in emailed comments. \"To do this, expect to see more 'metaverse' resources diverted from Reality Labs to Meta's AI initiatives.\"", "source": {"uri": "marketingdive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Marketing Dive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_adams@marketingdive.com", "name": "Peter Adams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_users", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Active users"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reality Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality headset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_world", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual world"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.marketingdive.com/imgproxy/sQvZzKI1eNzHF1dkl79SoR9Yktqqa0rxyLY6NT9UmUk/crop:5300:2994/g:nowe:0:0/rs:fill:770:435:0/bG9jYWw6Ly8vZGl2ZWltYWdlL0dldHR5SW1hZ2VzLTExNzgxNDE1ODcuanBn.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

While positioned as a strategic move to maintain competitiveness in the rapidly evolving tech industry, the revelation sparked apprehension among investors, leading to a notable decline in Meta's market value.\n\nMeta's proclamation to dedicate $5 billion to AI development highlights its unwavering commitment to innovation. In an era where technological advancement is synonymous with market leadership, Meta aims to fortify its position by leveraging the potential of AI. However, the magnitude of this investment took many investors by surprise, raising concerns about the company's financial stability amidst ambitious expansion plans.\n\nRead More: Zuckerberg's Meta AI launches in Pakistan\n\nAmidst the buzz surrounding its AI initiatives, Meta also unveiled its first-quarter earnings report, which exceeded market expectations. The company reported earnings per share of $4.71 on overall sales revenue of $36.46 billion, surpassing analysts' estimates. Notably, Meta's net income more than doubled compared to the previous year, showcasing robust financial performance despite uncertainties in the market.\n\nDespite the positive earnings report, Meta experienced a sharp decline in its market value, with shares plunging approximately 15% in after-hours trading. This significant downturn was attributed to weaker-than-expected second-quarter revenue guidance and heightened spending projections for AI endeavors. The market's reaction reflected investor skepticism towards Meta's ambitious investment plans and raised questions about the company's ability to sustain growth amidst escalating expenses.\n\nWhile Meta anticipates substantial returns on its AI investment, concerns loom regarding the associated costs and challenges. Implementing cutting-edge AI technologies demands significant financial resources and entails navigating a fiercely competitive landscape dominated by tech giants like Microsoft and Google. Balancing the allure of innovation with fiscal prudence poses a formidable challenge for Meta's leadership, requiring careful strategic planning and execution.\n\nRead More: Meta's AI chatbot widens its presence on WhatsApp\n\nMarket analysts, including Sophie Lund-Yates of Hargreaves Lansdown, caution against overlooking Meta's core advertising activities amidst its AI ambitions.

Revenue rose 27% from a year earlier to $36.46 billion, ahead of the analysts' call for $36.16 billion in sales. That represents the fastest rate of revenue growth since early 2021.\n\nThe accelerating revenue growth provided a big boost to Meta's bottom line. All told, the company reported net income of $12.37 billion, up more than 50% from the $5.71 billion in net income it reported one year ago. The company's profitability was also aided by a 16% drop in marketing costs compared to the year-ago period.\n\nHowever, those good numbers were undone by a disappointing forecast for the second quarter, with the company saying it sees sales of between $36.5 billion and $39 billion. The midpoint of that range is $37.75 billion, below Wall Street's forecast of $38.3 billion in revenue.\n\nMeta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg appeared to make things even worse during a conference call with analysts, saying that the company is planning to increase its investments in areas where it doesn't currently make much money, such as in virtual reality glasses and mixed reality, as well as artificial intelligence.\n\n\"On the upside, once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively,\" he said in an effort to reassure analysts and investors.\n\nInvestors' expectations have increased due to Meta's improved financial performance over the last few quarters. Prior to today's after-hours decline, the company's stock had gained 40% in the year to date, having almost tripled in value in 2023. That came after Zuckerberg announced what he said would be a \"year of efficiency\" in February 2023.\n\nBack then, Zuckerberg told analysts the company would focus on reducing money spent on unnecessary projects and streamlining its workforce in order to become \"stronger and more nimble\". He made good on that promise, with the company making around 21,000 job cuts in the first half of that year. This year, Zuckerberg promised that hiring will proceed at a much slower pace than what the company has done historically.\n\nMeta's report showed that the company's overall headcount at the end of the quarter was down more than 10% from the same period one year earlier, standing at 69,329.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, the company anticipates capital expenditure of between $35 billion and $40 billion, up from a prior forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion. That's because it will \"accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our artificial intelligence roadmap,\" Zuckerberg told analysts.\n\nMeta no longer reports how many daily active users and monthly active users its individual platforms have, but instead provides a figure called \"family daily active people\" that encompasses all of its main applications - Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. That number rose 7% from a year earlier to 3.24 billion at the end of March.\n\nOne reason for Meta's increased revenue is its digital advertising business, which has been growing steadily over the last year, following a dismal performance in 2022. Ad revenues were impacted that year by a major privacy update introduced by Apple Inc. and a general pullback in ad spending due to macroeconomic concerns.\n\nMeta responded by stepping up its investments in AI-driven targeted ads, researching models that can accurately predict more relevant ads for its users. It has also invested in AI tools that can automate the ad-creation process. Those investments have paid off handsomely, as the company reported that its ad revenue jumped 27% from a year earlier to $35.64 billion.\n\nIt's believed that Meta's ad business has also been aided by a stabilizing economy and a jump in spending from low-cost Chinese retailers such as Temu and Shein, which have ramped up their ad campaigns on Facebook and Instagram in an effort to reach new audiences. However, there are now concerns that these China-based advertisers may reduce their ad spending this year.\n\nMeta needs its ad business to keep up its strong performance because its Reality Labs business unit, which is responsible for its metaverse efforts, continues to be a massive drain on the company's finances. During the quarter, the unit drove $440 million in revenue but lost $3.85 billion overall.

Meta also raised its forecasted operating expenses and capital expenditures for the full year. The increased costs are related to the company's AI infrastructure.\n\nOn the other hand, Meta delivered solid revenue, operating profit, and EPS growth this quarter, which beat analysts' estimates.\n\nDuring the quarter, Meta released its AI assistant, Meta AI. This product was rolled out across its family of apps and is powered by Llama 3, an open-source large language model that is a ChatGPT competitor. The product is quite exciting and we recommend readers to try it out.\n\nOverall, this quarter's print was solid, but the weaker expected revenue for next quarter and higher expenses for the full year are spooking investors.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Meta? Find out by reading the original article on StockStory, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us: Meta's shares are somewhat volatile and over the last year have had 2 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for Meta and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 3 months ago, when the stock gained 21.9% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue, operating income, and EPS, all exceeding analysts' estimates. These beats were driven by better-than-expected daily active users along with a 21% year-on-year increase in ad impressions. Meta also saw a 2% tailwind in advertising pricing. Commentary across the sector suggests the advertising market is likely to rebound in 2024, partly explaining why Meta had a strong quarter.\n\nLooking ahead, Meta's Q1 2024 revenue guidance topped Wall Street's forecast, while its anticipated full-year 2024 capital expenditures came in slightly higher. The company expects this capex growth to come from investments in servers, including AI and non-AI hardware (you're welcome, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)), and data centers as it ramps up construction for its new data center architecture. These investments will be key for its open-source large language model, Llama, to successfully compete against OpenAI's closed-source ChatGPT.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting part of the quarter was the announcement of a quarterly dividend - the first in the company's history. Stockholders, as of February 22, 2024, were expected to receive $0.50 per share per quarter. Overall, this was a really good quarter that should please shareholders.\n\nMeta is up 24.6% since the beginning of the year, but at $432.05 per share it is still trading 18.1% below its 52-week high of $527.34 from April 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Meta's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,233.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capital expenditure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open-source software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPEB0E0CQ_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

His message to Meta's shareholders during the earnings call was to expect some bumpiness and keep their cool.\n\nZuckerberg is now more optimistic about his company's ability to build more capable AI models after the release of Llama 3, which is Meta's latest model. He said 'it makes sense' to go for heavier investments to build more advanced generative AI models and AI services that are going to be at a scale that will be the largest in the world. He said,\n\n\"I actually think we're in a place where we've shown that we can build leading models and be the leading AI company in the world. And that opens up a lot of additional opportunities beyond just the ones that are the most obvious for us.\"\n\nHe also told analysts that his company is not only building better models for developing social and e-commerce products, but they are looking to be the world's top AI firm. But such high ambitions cost money, so that may not be taken well by investors. Because when the last time Zuckerberg spent big funds on metaverse that panicked investors.\n\nHis recent announcement also reflected on the company's stock, which fell nearly 16% in the hours after he shared his investment plans. Zuckerberg said that historically, the company has seen stock volatility at times when they invested in product development and scaling but were not monetizing.\n\nMeta also revealed its capital expenditure plans for AI and said that the spend will be somewhere between $34 billion to $40 billion. Zuckerberg tried to convince Wall Street and reduce the panic as he pointed out that investors know the opportunity and should wait. He also laid out some strategies to make money with generative AI and to develop them as big business for Meta. But he also warned that it will take time, likely several years, according to him.\n\nOne avenue to generate business, he pointed out, is to provide AI tools to other businesses, which could help them in customer interaction. One way to do this is by evolving Meta's AI from just a chatbot to an AI agent that will be able to handle more detailed and complex workloads. This could be an option that they can utilize early for revenue generation, he said.\n\nMeta is also looking to introduce ads in AI interactions or even paid content by companies and brands. Though this is not yet the standard for chatbots to show paid content in their answers, but this might change in the future as Meta's business is primarily selling digital advertisements on its user facing apps. And the company has already deployed AI in its social media content recommendations.\n\nAt the moment, Meta's AI services are free to use, but as the models become larger and more specialized, people and businesses can pay for them to adopt for their commercial needs, as this will provide access to more computing power. Alphabet, the mother company of Google, is also investing big sums in AI development in the coming years, and Microsoft also plans to invest $100 billion to build a data center for AI development with its partner OpenAI, which is already enjoying strong backing from Microsoft.", "source": {"uri": "cryptorank.io", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoRank"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Relationship_Marketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Relationship Marketing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Zuckerberg's also been praised for some of his strategies around Meta's AI development, including the decision to open-source models and stockpile GPUs.\n\nWhile Meta's AI products, including Llama 3, have been generally well received, the company is not selling any version of its newest AI model, which is largely open source.\n\nBut while investors seemed willing to overlook spending concerns at the height of the AI boom in exchange for flashy product promises, the response to Zuckerberg's lavish spending shows this enthusiasm has its limits.\n\nOn the call, Zuckerberg warned investors: \"Building the leading AI will also be a larger undertaking than the other experiences we've added to our apps, and this is likely going to take several years on the upside once our new AI services reach scale.\"\n\nDespite years of investment in AI, the Facebook owner was not seen as an AI leader in the same way as Google, nor has it been able to control the post-ChatGPT narrative as successfully as Microsoft.\n\nJust months before OpenAI first launched ChatGPT in late 2022, Meta suffered an embarrassing setback after releasing its own AI chatbot called BlenderBot. The bot proved to be obsessed with conspiracy theories, prompting users to call it \"incompetent.\"\n\nMeta has since solidified its AI reputation, with later releases praised by developers. Zuckerberg's newest AI model even received a nod of approval from old rival Elon Musk.\n\nHowever, investors may be wary of Zuckerberg's tendency to jump the gun on a technology he's excited about.\n\nIt's not the first time he's announced huge spending for a new passion project -- Meta's heavy metaverse spending and subsequent stock slide are unlikely to be far from analysts' minds.\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, made outside normal working hours.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "beatrice_nolan@businessinsider.in", "name": "Beatrice Nolan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open source model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GPT-4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/109597661/mark-zuckerberg-thinks-ai-is-metas-future-not-everyone-is-convinced-.jpg?imgsize=335870", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The intensive cost and computing power required to make gains in new technology means spending forecasts for the year have increased from \u00a335 billion to $40 billion.\n\nThis headline resourcing will drive investments in developing AI infrastructure, including data centres and research costs. Billions have already been spent on GPUs, the chips that perform complex demands to power AI systems.\n\nFurther caution was urged with revenue for the second quarter expected to fall short of analysts' expectations, adding to concern from investors with the price of stock falling in after-hours trading. Meta's shares had plunged 11%, down to $493.50.\n\nA bullish Zuckerberg told analysts Meta \"should invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models and the largest scale AI services in the world\". As part of this vision, he believes the spending will need to increase \"meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products\".\n\nThe CEO appeared to be cognizant of investor apprehension on spending rises and sliding share prices as he pointed to Meta's \"strong track record\" of monetization. To balance spending commitments, the company is eyeing gains through AI advances in its existing services.\n\nZuckerberg mooted advances in business messaging, introducing advertising to AI chatbot interactions, and scaling up group charges for use of its bigger AI programs. He also vowed to oversee longer-term ambitions to deliver an avatar-filled metaverse, together with the development of wearable devices like smart glasses with an embedded AI assistant.\n\nThese goals will be tempered by sharp losses incurred by Reality Labs, Meta's virtual and hardware arm, with a deficit of almost $3.8 billion in the first quarter, together with a revenue of $440 million.", "source": {"uri": "readwrite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ReadWrite"}, "authors": [{"uri": "graeme_hanna@readwrite.com", "name": "Graeme Hanna", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smartglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wearable_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wearable technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Services", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pexels-julio-lopez-75309646-17614479-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 635, "textEnd": 643}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Meta also raised its forecasted operating expenses and capital expenditures for the full year. The increased costs are related to the company's AI infrastructure.\n\nOn the other hand, Meta delivered solid revenue, operating profit, and EPS growth this quarter, which beat analysts' estimates. During the quarter, Meta released its AI assistant, Meta AI. This product was rolled out across its family of apps and is powered by Llama 3, an open-source large language model that is a ChatGPT competitor. The product is quite exciting and we recommend readers to try it out.\n\nOverall, this quarter's print was solid, but the weaker expected revenue for next quarter and higher expenses for the full year are spooking investors.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Meta? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nMeta's shares are somewhat volatile and over the last year have had 2 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for Meta and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 3 months ago, when the stock gained 21.9% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue, operating income, and EPS, all exceeding analysts' estimates. These beats were driven by better-than-expected daily active users along with a 21% year-on-year increase in ad impressions. Meta also saw a 2% tailwind in advertising pricing. Commentary across the sector suggests the advertising market is likely to rebound in 2024, partly explaining why Meta had a strong quarter.\n\nLooking ahead, Meta's Q1 2024 revenue guidance topped Wall Street's forecast, while its anticipated full-year 2024 capital expenditures came in slightly higher. The company expects this capex growth to come from investments in servers, including AI and non-AI hardware (you're welcome, Nvidia), and data centers as it ramps up construction for its new data center architecture. These investments will be key for its open-source large language model, Llama, to successfully compete against OpenAI's closed-source ChatGPT.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting part of the quarter was the announcement of a quarterly dividend - the first in the company's history. Stockholders, as of February 22, 2024, were expected to receive $0.50 per share per quarter. Overall, this was a really good quarter that should please shareholders.\n\nMeta is up 24.6% since the beginning of the year, but at $432.05 per share it is still trading 18.1% below its 52-week high of $527.34 from April 2024.

However, a poor Q2 projection saw shares of the social media company tumble by over 15%.\n\nMeta Stock expects second-quarter revenue between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, which is below the consensus forecast of $38.24 billion.\n\nIn addition to the dismal Q2 forecast, Meta CFO Susan Li increased the company's full-year total expenses estimate from $94 billion -- $99 billion to $96 billion -- $99 billion due to greater infrastructure and legal costs.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg stated during the business's earnings call, \"As we scale capex and energy expenses for AI, we will continue to focus on operating the rest of our company efficiently.\"\n\nBut, realistically, even after transferring our existing resources to focus on AI, we'll still need to expand our investment envelope significantly before we see much income from some of these new products.\"\n\nLi also stated that Meta expects its Reality Labs segment to record significant year-over-year operating losses as it expands its AI, AR, and VR activities.\n\n\"While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts,\" Li stated in a press release.\n\nMeta Stock earned $4.71 profits per share on $36.46 billion in revenue for the quarter. According to Bloomberg analysts, Wall Street expected an EPS of $4.30 and a revenue of $36.12 billion.\n\nMeta stock has risen 131% in the past year and more than 39% year-to-date. This outperforms its main competition, Google (GOOG,GOOGL), which has increased by 50% in the past year and 13% overall.\n\nWhile a recovery in the digital advertising market has contributed to Meta's stock performance, the stock price skyrocketed last quarter after the social media company announced it would initiate a $0.50 per share dividend and increase its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion.\n\nOn Wednesday, the business made no announcements on its shareholder return objectives.\n\nHowever, 404 Media said the chatbot has already sparked criticism after joining a private Facebook group for mothers in Manhattan and claiming to have its own child.\n\nOn the metaverse front, CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated on Monday that Meta would open-source its Horizon operating system for headgear, allowing third-party firms such as Lenovo and Microsoft to build their own devices based on the software. The goal is to bring more headsets to market while also expanding Meta Stock 's presence in the AR/VR arena.\n\nThe corporation will also benefit greatly if Congress' TikTok prohibition, which President Biden signed into law on Wednesday, survives legal challenges. If the app is unavailable in the United States, it stands to reason that users and producers will resort to alternative platforms such as Instagram to satisfy their social networking needs.",

It was a small beat, as analysts were looking for revenue of $36.1 billion on average, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Profit more than doubled to $12.4 billion or earnings per share of $4.71.\n\nBut the Menlo Park, California-based social networking company also projected second quarter sales of $36.5 billion to $39 billion. Analysts expected $38.2 billion. At the same time, Meta raised its expected costs for the year, and now believes capital expenditures will be $35 billion to $40 billion. Earlier this year, it estimated expenses related to things like servers, AI hardware and data centers would be $30 billion to $37 billion.\n\n\"We expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts,\" Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said in a statement.\n\nThe shares tumbled 11% in extended trading. The stock was up 39% so far this year at market close and has been trading near all-time highs for the past month, in part reflecting excitement around AI.\n\nMeta has been spending aggressively to compete on AI against other tech peers like Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc., which is driving some of the increase in costs. The company announced plans for a new $800 million data center in January, and is also developing its own chips for artificial intelligence services. Meta is also working on several new iterations of its large language model, known as Llama, for powering chatbots and other AI services.\n\nIn the previous quarter, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg announced a $50 billion stock buyback in addition to the company's first ever quarterly dividend, an effort to placate investors frustrated by the company's aggressive spending on technologies that have yet to pay off. Zuckerberg has spent years plowing money into efforts to build the so-called Metaverse, a virtual world where he hopes people will one day play and work.\n\nReality Labs, the Meta division focused on its futuristic bets, reported a loss of $3.85 billion for the first quarter, roughly the same as a year ago. That division, which also oversees VR headsets and Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, reported an annual loss of more than $16 billion in 2023.\n\nThe company reiterated its broader 2024 spending plans, saying it will shell out $96 billion to $99 billion for the calendar year, up slightly from a low-end target of $94 billion to $99 billion. It previously said that much of that would go toward infrastructure costs in addition to long-term bets on augmented and virtual reality.\n\nMeta's mixed report comes on the same day that President Joe Biden signed a bill into law that would force TikTok's parent company, ByteDance Ltd., to sell the popular video service or face a ban in the US. The potential elimination of a major competitor could give a boost to Meta's advertising business since its short-video offering Reels is a clone of TikTok.\n\n(Updates with CFO comments in fourth paragraph.

Then he moved onto the metaverse, touting his company's headsets, glasses and operating system. He spent almost the entirety of his opening remarks focused on the many ways Meta loses money.\n\nInvestors weren't into it. Meta shares tumbled as much as 19% in extended trading on Wednesday, wiping out more than $200 billion in market cap. The drop came despite Meta reporting better-than-expected profit and revenue for the first quarter.\n\nZuckerberg appeared ready for the sell-off.\n\n\"I think it's worth calling that out, that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it,\" Zuckerberg said. He cited past efforts like short-video service Reels, Stories and the transition to mobile.\n\nMeta generates 98% of its revenue from digital advertising. But to the extent Zuckerberg talked about ads, he was looking to the future and the ways the company could potentially turn its current investments into ad dollars. In discussing Meta's effort to build a \"leading AI,\" Zuckerberg said, \"There are several ways to build a massive business here including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions.\"\n\nHe spent more time talking about Meta Llama 3, the company's newest large language model, and the recent rollout of Meta AI, the company's answer to OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nZuckerberg then moved onto potential opportunities for expansion within the mixed-reality headset market, like a headset for work or fitness. Meta opened up access to the operating system that powers its Quest headsets on Monday, which Zuckerberg said will help the mixed-reality ecosystem grow faster.\n\nHe also talked up Meta's AR glasses, which he called \"the ideal device for an AI assistant because you can let them see what you see and hear what you hear.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashley_capoot@cnbc.com", "name": "Ashley Capoot", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality headset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirksen_Senate_Office_Building", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dirksen Senate Office Building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Augmented reality"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Home_Based", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Home Based", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107405795-1713972773743-gettyimages-1975542608-109a8827_foivv0mb.jpeg?v=1713972966&w=1920&h=1080", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Reveals Significant AI Influence on Facebook and Instagram", "body": "Meta announced the results of its first-quarter revenue amounting to about $36.45 billion, with a percent growth of 27% more compared to the first-quarter revenue in the previous year.\n\nMeta Platforms, the company helmed by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, has laid the foundation for a wide-ranging AI-powered content recommendation on its platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram, through the recent disclosure of significant financial information during the first-quarter results announcement.\n\nAccording to Mark Zuckerberg, \"Right now, about 30% of the posts on Facebook feed are delivered by our AI recommendation system. That's up 2x over the last couple of years,\" he said in his opening statement, adding, \"And for the first time ever, more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram is now AI recommended.\"\n\nThis is a major shift from a few years ago, demonstrating the growing power of artificial intelligence algorithms over human beings in influencing these social media platforms' user experiences.\n\nAI-Powered Tools Drive Revenue Growth\n\nThe presence of AI in social channels is not only enhancing consumer engagement but has also brought about a series of benefits for the advertisers too. With AI-driven tools including Advantage+ Shopping and Advantage+ App Campaigns Meta has seen a growth in revenue, which, compared to the previous year, has been more than doubled. This implies that AI provides Meta with an opportunity to improve the ability of ads to target specific audiences, resulting in business growth for the platform.\n\nMeta announced the results of its first-quarter revenue amounting to about $36.45 billion, with a percent growth of 27% more compared to the first-quarter revenue in the previous year. This revenue was more than the Street consensus estimate, which shows strong financial performance by Meta in spite of the changing regulatory landscape and markets. The first quarter's earnings per share was reported at $4.71, exceeding the Street estimate of $4.33, which strongly indicates the investor's confidence in the company's performance.\n\nEnhanced User Controls and Transparency\n\nIn accordance with the user empowerment principle, Meta launched new controls last year that allowed Facebook and Instagram users to manage their content preferences on those platforms. These practices were given as a way to increase the transparency rate as well as to make up the deficiency which arise as a result of using AI technology in order to establish the contents facing users which could be selected by them. Furthermore, Meta also gave tags that were visible to the person on Facebook, Instagram, or Threads, which informed the users what they were consuming.\n\nAI-powered content recommendation systems, that allow more than 50% of Instagram posts and 30% of Facebook posts to be automatically recommended by the AI algorithms, is also another important step for Meta Platforms. This demonstrates Meta's commitment towards realizing the application of tech to champion empathy and enhance interactions online via the use of their products and services.\n\nAnother thing that needs to be highlighted is the AI-driven advertising tools that enable such optimization by focusing the ads on target groups and making the delivery far more effective. Meta has reached a new level and evolved in order to keep up with market dynamics, its AI component, however, will continue to play an important part in the development of future social media platforms.", "source": {"uri": "cryptopolitan.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cryptopolitan"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brenda_kanana@cryptopolitan.com", "name": "Brenda Kanana", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recommender system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "User experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowerment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Empowerment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Default_Instagram_app_1-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Meta also raised its forecasted operating expenses and capital expenditures for the full year. The increased costs are related to the company's AI infrastructure.\n\nOn the other hand, Meta delivered solid revenue, operating profit, and EPS growth this quarter, which beat analysts' estimates. During the quarter, Meta released its AI assistant, Meta AI. This product was rolled out across its family of apps and is powered by Llama 3, an open-source large language model that is a ChatGPT competitor. The product is quite exciting and we recommend readers to try it out.\n\nOverall, this quarter's print was solid, but the weaker expected revenue for next quarter and higher expenses for the full year are spooking investors.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Meta? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nMeta's shares are somewhat volatile and over the last year have had 2 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for Meta and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 3 months ago, when the stock gained 21.9% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue, operating income, and EPS, all exceeding analysts' estimates. These beats were driven by better-than-expected daily active users along with a 21% year-on-year increase in ad impressions. Meta also saw a 2% tailwind in advertising pricing. Commentary across the sector suggests the advertising market is likely to rebound in 2024, partly explaining why Meta had a strong quarter.\n\nLooking ahead, Meta's Q1 2024 revenue guidance topped Wall Street's forecast, while its anticipated full-year 2024 capital expenditures came in slightly higher. The company expects this capex growth to come from investments in servers, including AI and non-AI hardware (you're welcome, Nvidia), and data centers as it ramps up construction for its new data center architecture. These investments will be key for its open-source large language model, Llama, to successfully compete against OpenAI's closed-source ChatGPT.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting part of the quarter was the announcement of a quarterly dividend - the first in the company's history. Stockholders, as of February 22, 2024, were expected to receive $0.50 per share per quarter. Overall, this was a really good quarter that should please shareholders.\n\nMeta is up 24.6% since the beginning of the year, but at $432.05 per share it is still trading 18.1% below its 52-week high of $527.34 from April 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Meta's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,233.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth.

(NASDAQ: META), the company's most recent first-quarter financial results have not only seen a significant stock price drop but have also led to a considerable decline in CEO Mark Zuckerberg's net worth. Indeed, as Meta's shares tumbled, shedding $200 billion in market value, Zuckerberg's net worth took a substantial hit, dropping by approximately $899 million.\n\nMeta, known for its social media giant Facebook, among other tech ventures, reported robust quarterly earnings with revenue hitting 36,455 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $4.71, surpassing the expectations set by Wall Street analysts.\n\nDespite these strong performance indicators, investors' sentiment appeared cautious, possibly reflecting concerns over the company's future growth prospects or operational costs, especially as it pertains to its ambitious artificial intelligence (AI), metaverse, and virtual reality initiatives.\n\nThis decline is part of a broader trend affecting tech billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos globally as market dynamics shift and investors reassess the value and future profitability of tech conglomerates.\n\nIn the wake of OpenAI's groundbreaking release of ChatGPT in 2022, Meta Platforms quickly embraced generative AI, placing itself at the forefront of Silicon Valley's tech evolution. This strategic pivot not only fueled consumer excitement but also sparked intense competition among major tech players like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG(GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMAZN), and Meta themselves -- all racing to expand their AI capabilities.\n\nBy April 2024, Meta had taken a significant step forward by introducing Meta AI, its AI assistant powered by the advanced open-source Llama 3 model. This development enhanced the functionality of popular apps like WhatsApp and Instagram, aligning Meta with top AI innovators such as OpenAI and Alphabet.\n\nAnd while these efforts may not have captured the public's attention as dramatically as ChatGPT did initially, Meta maintains that its Llama 3 model rivals the best in the field.\n\nThe recent developments at Meta Platforms illustrate the complex interplay between strong financial performance and strategic investments in emerging technologies.

It was a small beat, as analysts were looking for revenue of $36.1 billion on average, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Profit more than doubled to $12.4 billion or earnings per share of $4.71.\n\nBut the Menlo Park, California-based social networking company also projected second quarter sales of $36.5 billion to $39 billion. Analysts expected $38.2 billion. At the same time, Meta raised its expected costs for the year, and now believes capital expenditures will be $35 billion to $40 billion. Earlier this year, it estimated expenses related to things like servers, AI hardware and data centers would be $30 billion to $37 billion.\n\n\"We expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts,\" Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said in a statement.\n\nThe shares tumbled 11% in extended trading. The stock was up 39% so far this year at market close and has been trading near all-time highs for the past month, in part reflecting excitement around AI.\n\nMeta has been spending aggressively to compete on AI against other tech peers like Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc., which is driving some of the increase in costs. The company announced plans for a new $800 million data center in January, and is also developing its own chips for artificial intelligence services. Meta is also working on several new iterations of its large language model, known as Llama, for powering chatbots and other AI services.\n\nIn the previous quarter, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg announced a $50 billion stock buyback in addition to the company's first ever quarterly dividend, an effort to placate investors frustrated by the company's aggressive spending on technologies that have yet to pay off. Zuckerberg has spent years plowing money into efforts to build the so-called Metaverse, a virtual world where he hopes people will one day play and work.\n\nReality Labs, the Meta division focused on its futuristic bets, reported a loss of $3.85 billion for the first quarter, roughly the same as a year ago. That division, which also oversees VR headsets and Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, reported an annual loss of more than $16 billion in 2023.\n\nThe company reiterated its broader 2024 spending plans, saying it will shell out $96 billion to $99 billion for the calendar year, up slightly from a low-end target of $94 billion to $99 billion. It previously said that much of that would go toward infrastructure costs in addition to long-term bets on augmented and virtual reality.\n\nMeta's mixed report comes on the same day that President Joe Biden signed a bill into law that would force TikTok's parent company, ByteDance Ltd., to sell the popular video service or face a ban in the US. The potential elimination of a major competitor could give a boost to Meta's advertising business since its short-video offering Reels is a clone of TikTok.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Capital expenditure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_Park,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Menlo Park, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Menlo Park, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reality Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ByteDance", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ByteDance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality headset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smartglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray-Ban", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ray-Ban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_world", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual world"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_repurchase", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Share repurchase"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1975387102-e1713996326804.jpg?resize=1200,600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Mark Zuckerberg said his main focus for the rest of 2024 and likely 2025 will be \"getting millions or billions of people to use Meta AI\" rather than generating revenue from it. He cautioned that Meta products such Instagram Reels have in the past not immediately generated revenue as they scaled before they became profitable pieces of Meta's ad business. Last week, the company announced it would integrate its partially released Llama 3 large language model across its platforms. The Meta AI assistant will also roll out to Australia, Canada, Singapore, Nigeria and Pakistan. The company also said it would add real-time image generation to its social networks.\n\nMETA in the first quarter of FY 24 has reported the adjusted earnings per share of $4.71, beating the analysts' estimates for the adjusted earnings per share of $4.32. The company had reported the adjusted revenue growth of 27 percent to $36.46 billion in the first quarter of FY 24, beating the analysts' estimates for revenue of $36.16 billion. The company's Reality Labs division, oriented towards the metaverse, fell short of expectations in the first quarter, recording sales of $440 million. While this represented a 30 per cent increase year-on-year, it failed to meet the anticipated revenue of $475 million. The company's daily active people (DAP) metric, used to track unique users across its apps, grew by 7 per cent, slightly lower than the 8 per cent growth recorded in the preceding quarter.\n\nMeta also now expects its capital expenditure to be between $30bn and $40bn this year, up from an earlier forecast of between $35bn and $37bn.\n\nThe company disclosed its revenue forecast for the April-June quarter, estimating it to range between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, with a midpoint of $37.8 billion. However, these figures fell short of analysts' projections, which averaged at $38.3 billion.\n\nMeta attributed the anticipated increase in expenses to support investments in new AI products and the requisite computing infrastructure. Further, it indicated a continued upward trajectory in spending into the next fiscal year, with the total expense forecast for 2024 raised to $96 billion-$99 billion.\n\nAdditionally, Meta stands to potentially benefit from regulatory pressures on its competitor TikTok, which faces the prospect of a US ban.", "source": {"uri": "fxdailyreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FXDailyReport.Com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "swapna_meka@fxdailyreport.com", "name": "Swapna Meka", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capital expenditure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Venture_Capital", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Venture Capital", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://fxdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Social-media-icons-whatsapp-facebook-and-other-on-smart-phone-000042874854_Large.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2011-04-25", "textStart": 61, "textEnd": 73}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

On the other hand, next quarter's revenue guidance of $37.75 billion was less impressive, coming in 1.5% below analysts' estimates.

Find out by reading the original article on StockStory, it's free.\n\nMeta (META) Q1 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nFamously founded by Mark Zuckerberg in his Harvard dorm, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) operates a collection of the largest social networks in the world - Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, along with its metaverse focused Facebook Reality Labs.\n\nSocial NetworkingBusinesses must meet their customers where they are, which over the past decade has come to mean on social networks. In 2020, users spent over 2.5 hours a day on social networks, a figure that has increased every year since measurement began. As a result, businesses continue to shift their advertising and marketing dollars online.\n\nSales GrowthMeta's revenue growth over the last three years has been mediocre, averaging 16.4% annually. This quarter, Meta reported decent 27.3% year-on-year revenue growth, in line with analysts' expectations.\n\nGuidance for the next quarter indicates Meta is expecting revenue to grow 18% year on year to $37.75 billion, improving from the 11% year-on-year increase it recorded in the comparable quarter last year. Ahead of the earnings results, analysts were projecting sales to grow 14.9% over the next 12 months.\n\nKey Takeaways from Meta's Q1 Results It was great to see Meta deliver solid revenue, operating profit, and EPS growth this quarter, which beat analysts' estimates. That was driven by more daily active users than expected and 6% year-on-year growth in average ad prices. On the other hand, its revenue guidance for next quarter missed analysts' expectations and it took up its forecasted operating expenses and capital expenditures for the full year. The increased costs are related to the company's AI infrastructure.\n\nDuring the quarter, Meta released its AI assistant, Meta AI. This product was rolled out across its family of apps and is powered by Llama 3, an open-source large language model that is a ChatGPT competitor. The product is quite exciting and we recommend readers to try it out.\n\nOverall, this quarter's print was solid but the weaker expected revenue for next quarter and higher expenses for the full year are spooking investors.

Now it is spending billions making it obsolete", "body": "Almost all of Meta's money comes from ads shown to people on social networks. But you'd be forgiven for thinking otherwise.\n\nThat's because so much of the discussion from within the company is about anything but social networks. Even down to its name, it would prefer you to think of it as a metaverse company - or, more recently, an artificial intelligence company.\n\nThat effort to move away from social networks has proven costly. In its most recent results, released this week, Meta said that the \"Reality Labs\" operation that aims to build the metaverse lost $3.85 billion.\n\nThat means that in total it has lost $45 billion on the operation since 2020, when it started reporting separate results for that division. It does have some work to show for it - the recent release of the Meta Quest 3 was met with rave reviews - but it doesn't have much money to show for it.\n\nAnd now Meta is spending even more money on artificial intelligence. During a call on those same results, Mark Zuckerberg noted that the company was spending more money than ever on AI research - and that it is not in danger of making money anytime soon.\n\n\"Historically, investing to build these new scaled experiences in our apps has been a very good long-term investment for us and for investors who have stuck with us,\" he said.\n\n\"And the initial signs are quite positive here, too. But building the leading AI will also be a larger undertaking than the other experiences we've added to our apps, and this is likely going to take several years.\"\n\nThat has spooked investors. For years, shareholders and analysts have been worried about the vast sums of money being poured into Reality Labs, and the lack of profits that are coming out.\n\nNow, Meta appears to be doing the same with AI. In much the same way as the metaverse, Meta would prefer to be thought of as artificial intelligence company, rather than a social network one.\n\nAs with the metaverse, it does have something to show for its investment. The recent introduction of its large language model, Llama 3, was well received, and it has shown an admirable commitment to being open about its work in artificial intelligence.\n\nSome of that AI work will benefit the more traditional social networks in straightforward ways. Allowing users to chat to its Meta AI through its messaging apps offers easy access to its artificial intelligence and quick ways to improve them, for instance, and Meta has said that it hopes to use the technology to improve its ad offerings.\n\nBut really both the metaverse and AI seem to be about finding a new way of using the internet that does away with the feeds and friends of traditional social networking. Meta clearly believes that it is building the future, though it is yet to convince many of its investors.\n\nMeta does still have the capability to build social networks. For years, it had only ever made Facebook in house - the giant networks of Instagram and WhatsApp were acquired, though Meta did much to build them.\n\nBut over the last year, the success of Threads suggests that there are still new kinds of growth to be found in traditional social media. But that might have more to do with the fact that X/Twitter has faced problems, and Threads offered an alternative.\n\nMeta's work in the metaverse might finally be seeing some more successes, too. As part of the same results, Mr Zuckerberg spoke about Meta's smart glasses, which it makes in collaboration with Ray-Ban.\n\nHe pointed to the fact that a new update brings multimodal AI, so that they can understand a variety of inputs. And he said that the glasses were sold out in many colours, suggesting that demand is high.\n\n\"I used to think that AR glasses wouldn't really be a mainstream product until we had full holographic displays,\" he said. \"But now it seems pretty clear that there's also a meaningful market for fashionable AI glasses without a display.\"\n\nThose glasses might offer a hint at the future of Meta: smart technology on our faces to enable the metaverse, powered by AI. Zuckerberg certainly hopes so - and he's spending an awful lot of money trying to convince everyone else.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reality Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_Quest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oculus Quest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal_interaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multimodal interaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smartglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray-Ban", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ray-Ban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instant messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Augmented reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/04/25/16/GettyImages-2148009137.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Reveals Significant AI Influence on Facebook and Instagram | AI innovators", "body": "Meta Platforms, the company helmed by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, has laid the foundation for a wide-ranging AI-powered content recommendation on its platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram, through the recent disclosure of significant financial information during the first-quarter results announcement.\n\nAccording to Mark Zuckerberg, \"Right now, about 30% of the posts on Facebook feed are delivered by our AI recommendation system. That's up 2x over the last couple of years,\" he said in his opening statement, adding, \"And for the first time ever, more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram is now AI recommended.\"\n\nThis is a major shift from a few years ago, demonstrating the growing power of artificial intelligence algorithms over human beings in influencing these social media platforms' user experiences.\n\nAI-Powered Tools Drive Revenue Growth\n\nThe presence of AI in social channels is not only enhancing consumer engagement but has also brought about a series of benefits for the advertisers too. With AI-driven tools including Advantage+ Shopping and Advantage+ App Campaigns Meta has seen a growth in revenue, which, compared to the previous year, has been more than doubled. This implies that AI provides Meta with an opportunity to improve the ability of ads to target specific audiences, resulting in business growth for the platform.\n\nMeta announced the results of its first-quarter revenue amounting to about $36.45 billion, with a percent growth of 27% more compared to the first-quarter revenue in the previous year. This revenue was more than the Street consensus estimate, which shows strong financial performance by Meta in spite of the changing regulatory landscape and markets. The first quarter's earnings per share was reported at $4.71, exceeding the Street estimate of $4.33, which strongly indicates the investor's confidence in the company's performance.\n\nEnhanced User Controls and Transparency\n\nIn accordance with the user empowerment principle, Meta launched new controls last year that allowed Facebook and Instagram users to manage their content preferences on those platforms. These practices were given as a way to increase the transparency rate as well as to make up the deficiency which arise as a result of using AI technology in order to establish the contents facing users which could be selected by them. Furthermore, Meta also gave tags that were visible to the person on Facebook, Instagram, or Threads, which informed the users what they were consuming.\n\nAI-powered content recommendation systems, that allow more than 50% of Instagram posts and 30% of Facebook posts to be automatically recommended by the AI algorithms, is also another important step for Meta Platforms. This demonstrates Meta's commitment towards realizing the application of tech to champion empathy and enhance interactions online via the use of their products and services.\n\nAnother thing that needs to be highlighted is the AI-driven advertising tools that enable such optimization by focusing the ads on target groups and making the delivery far more effective. Meta has reached a new level and evolved in order to keep up with market dynamics, its AI component, however, will continue to play an important part in the development of future social media platforms.", "source": {"uri": "cryptorank.io", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoRank"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recommender system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "User experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowerment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Empowerment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

A disastrous performance of the company was accompanied by its share price having dived by 19% as the investor community was somewhat concerned about the CEO's interest in any other futuristic ventures. Such a burst of events secured the company a $200 billion loss in market capitalization.\n\nThe Meta shares, which reported a better outcome for the period than projected, lost great value on the stock exchange after the market closed. The investors' attitude was influenced by the futuristic turns that Zuckerburg made looking far ahead, like AI and metaverse, neglecting the up-to-date revenue flows in digital advertising presently. Among the takeaways, the impact of financial performance, as well as strategic shifts on an organization's operations, is also an important consideration.\n\nAlthough digital ads still are its main income source, which provided Meta with 98% of the total earnings, Zuckerberg's speech also divulged AI and new hardware devices like mixed reality headsets and AR glasses as potential income sources in the future. Such a move reflects Meta's effort to continue expanding and exploring new markets and technologies rather than worrying about a reported loss of the Reality Labs unit of over $10 billion.\n\nMeta tackled the challenges of 2022, and the company devised a smart cost-cutting strategy that included reducing headcount and expenses.\n\nThis method, however, was successful, as the company's stock popularity multiplied more than three times compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, Meta is scheduled to take on more capital spending on its AI infrastructure, symbolizing that it gives top priority to long-term advancement over short-term profits.\n\nMeta's repositioning towards AI and building the Metaverse will probably result in a reduction in stock price because of the high cost of the investment made, and the ongoing losses of the department reality labs can discourage investors. Although volatile from a short-run perspective, it may serve favorably for those with a long-term investment horizon. Because of Meta's history of transforming from early-stage investment scenarios to a profitable business, its concentration on innovative technologies seems appealing. It is expected to result in considerable new revenue flows and better positions, which would be, of course, carefully managed.\n\nThe remarks of the Meta platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg concerning AI and the Metaverse which took place during the earnings conference call have led to a dropping reaction in the investor market. As a consequence, the Meta Platforms suffered a large decline of 19% in its stock quotation, which dropped market capitalization to almost $200 billion. While the Q1 financial report stated positive results, investor anxiety came from Zuckerberg's remarks stressing the presentation of futuristic technologies over the main revenue source, which was the digital advertising income.\n\nMeta's portfolio always begins with digital advertising and its strategic engagement with AI and new hardware can be a clear sign of the company's intention to expand its horizon. Although it could be a problem of share market volatility in the early stages, developing new technologies has a long-term perspective and success story of Meta. As Meta chases out its quest for more profitability and growth, responsible leadership will count to realize its vision and long-term objective.", "source": {"uri": "cryptorank.io", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoRank"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality headset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mixed reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Augmented reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

While AI has long been touted as a transformative and disruptive technology, the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022 marked a milestone for systems that could be trained to generate unique content like text, images, video and sound based on a prompt. The chatbot proved a hit with consumers and sparked intense enthusiasm for the technology, catapulting giants like Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon into an AI arms race to reveal, improve and invest in their own AI products. The tech titans, alongside a host of startups like Anthropic, Mistral and Inflection AI, have since produced and released an increasingly powerful array of systems. They show little sign of slowing down, even though a road to profitability through AI is not always clear. Meta released its AI assistant, Meta AI, as a standalone tool last week. The bot, which complements its in-app tools on platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram, is driven by its powerful open source AI model, Llama 3, and is a clear effort to compete with standalone bots from other market leaders like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Alphabet's Gemini.\n\n\"You all know our product development playbook by this point,\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors on Wednesday, attempting to soothe investors by referencing the company's historic process of releasing a new product, building an audience and scaling it before monetizing it. \"There are several ways to build a massive business here,\" Zuckerberg said, noting that this has happened with products like Reels, Stories and transitioning News Feed to mobile. With time, Zuckerberg said he is confident this will happen with Meta AI as well, but warned it would take time for these investments to bear fruit. \"Realistically, even with shifting many of our existing resources to focus on AI, we'll still grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nShares of IBM tumbled nearly 9% during premarket trading. The company unveiled uninspiring sales figures during its earnings report on Wednesday.\n\nZuckerberg is worth an estimated $173.1 billion. His fortune, a large portion of which comes from his founding stake in Meta's precursor, Facebook, makes him the fourth richest person in the world, behind Bernard Arnault, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, with whom he has publicly feuded and agreed to fight in a cage match.

I also expect to see a multi-year investment cycle before we've fully scaled Meta AI, business AI and more into the profitable services.\"\n\nDuring the earnings call, the company's chief financial officer, Susan Li, said the cost of revenue increased 9%. The higher infrastructure costs related to investments in AI were partially offset by what she described as \"lapping Reality Labs inventory-related valuation adjustments\".\n\nReality Lab is the company's augmented reality and metaverse initiative. This division posted an operating loss of $3.8bn, with revenue at $440m, up 30%, driven by Quest headset sales.\n\nLooking at how the firm has broadened its AIO capabilities, Li said investments in developing advanced recommendation systems were driving incremental engagement on the company's platforms. \"People are finding added value by discovering content from accounts they're not connected to,\" she said. \"The level of recommended content in our apps has scaled as we've improved these systems, and we see further opportunity to increase the relevance and personalisation of recommendations as we advance our models.\"\n\nLi added that Meta was also introducing deeper integrations of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into its apps in the US and 12 other countries. \"Along with using Meta, AI within our chat surfaces, people will now be able to use Meta AI in search within our apps, as well as Feed and Groups on Facebook,\" she said. \"We expect these integrations will complement our social discovery strategy as our recommendation systems help people to discover and explore their interests while Meta AI enables them to dive deeper on topics they're interested in.\"\n\nMirroring Zuckerberg's comments, Li said: \"Investing to build these new scaled experiences in our apps has been a very good long-term investment for us and for investors who have stuck with us. And the initial signs are quite positive here, too. But building the leading AI will also be a larger undertaking than the other experiences we've added to our apps, and this is likely going to take several years.\"\n\nAmong the areas Meta is considering in terms of boosting AI-related revenue include scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions and charging people to use what he called \"bigger AI models and access to more compute\".\n\nExpanding on the business messaging concept, Li said the longer-term opportunity for Meta was to provide business AI. \"We have been testing the ability for businesses to set up AIs for business messaging that represent them in chats with customers, starting by supporting shopping use cases such as responding to people asking for more information on a product or its availability,\" she said. \"This is very, very early. We've been testing this with a handful of businesses on Messenger and WhatsApp and we're hearing good feedback.\"\n\nAccording to Li, businesses that have piloted the GenAI-based service said it saved them significant time. \"Consumers noted more timely response times,\" she said.\n\nCommenting on the company's long-term investment plans in AI, Forrester's vice-president research director Mike Proulx said: \"There's no doubt that Meta is all-in on AI, but to achieve its vision, the company has to make big investments in infrastructure. Mark Zuckerberg's 'heads up' was reminiscent of what he once said about the metaverse, and that didn't exactly go so well.\n\n\"But this is different from Meta's metaverse gamble because AI has real and practical use cases now. The question remains whether Meta can contend in the AI race while maintaining a strong financial position. To do this, expect to see more 'metaverse' resources diverted from Reality Labs to Meta's AI initiatives.\"", "source": {"uri": "computerweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Computer Weekly"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Augmented reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recommender system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality headset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrester_Research", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forrester Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/visuals/ComputerWeekly/Hero Images/AI-artificial-intelligence-workforce-3-adobe.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

But lower than expected guidance for revenue in the June quarter, and founder Mark Zuckerberg's decision to lift investment in AI over the course of this year has clearly worried some investors.\n\nHaving listened to both tech billionaires make their pitches this week, Chanticleer was far more impressed with Zuckerberg's clear-eyed idea of where Meta is going, and where AI fits into his plans.\n\nYes, he's stuck in a kind of AI purgatory, where huge investment - capex is now expected to be as high as $US40 billion ($62 billion) in 2024 - is required to build out infrastructure that won't be monetised quickly.\n\nBut to his credit, Zuckerberg isn't trying to pretend otherwise.\n\n\"As we're scaling capex and energy expenses for AI, we'll continue focusing on operating the rest of our company efficiently. But realistically, even with shifting many of our existing resources to focus on AI [we] will still grow our investment meaningfully before we make much revenue from new products.\"\n\nHe even warned that history shows the company's share price will bounce around during this phase of scaling new products before monetising; exactly the same thing happened as Meta invested in mobile platforms and services, which turned out to be big money spinners.\n\nZuckerberg says it may be a while for the pay-off for some AI investments to arrive, but that is a bet he's prepared to make. \"Historically, investing to build these new skills, experiences and apps has been a very good long-term investment for us and for investors who have stuck with us.\"\n\nUnlike Tesla's autonomy vision, which faces several substantial hurdles - not least of which is regulatory approvals for self-driving cars - the AI vision that Zuckerberg laid out on Thursday morning was sensible.\n\nEssentially, sitting under the Meta AI banner are several different types of AI, including AI for its social media users (who can now ask an AI assistant questions from their Facebook page), AI for content creators and businesses (to help them build more engaging posts and advertisements) and AI for its internal developers (to help them write code).\n\nEmbedding what Zuckerberg grandly claimed could be the world's best AI assistant into Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp would clearly be great for engagement. Helping businesses use AI to create better advertisements and posts will also sell premium ad products.\n\nBut Zuckerberg sees one of the biggest opportunities in what he calls messaging, but what might be better described as in-app commerce. With AI, customer service can move from chatbots to something on the level of a sales agent, allowing businesses to sell directly via Facebook and Instagram in a way they cannot do at present.\n\n\"The cost of engaging with people in messaging is still very high, but AI should bring that down just dramatically for businesses and creators. That has the potential that's beyond just increasing engagement, and increasing the quality of the ads. I think that that's probably one of the near term opportunities - that's not the next quarter or the quarter after that, but that's not like a five-year opportunity, either.\"\n\nZuckerberg is not making these AI investments on faith. He's accelerating his investment spend after seeing the early AI gains, betting that the infrastructure and scale Meta is building will have a big pay-off. He's clear-eyed about the timelines, and accepting of the volatility it will create as progress plays out over America's ridiculously short-term quarterly reporting cycle.\n\n\"I think it makes sense to go for it... because that's what we do.\"\n\nBut investors need to grasp the lessons in this AI case study. As a tech giant, Meta is much further down the track than companies in other sectors who will need to build AI models and infrastructure. But even it faces a period of very big investment before the revenue starts to flow.\n\nZuckerberg has a plan to steer Meta through AI purgatory relatively quickly. But plenty of other companies will get stuck in this phase.", "source": {"uri": "afr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Financial Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-driving car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_creation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Content creation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3449%2C$multiply_3%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_36/t_crop_custom/c_scale%2Cw_800%2Cq_88%2Cf_jpg/t_afr_opinion_no_age_social_wm/f4693025b0a1c4dc05eaf405e46e1c401a4e493c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

It said earlier this year that it would no longer break out numbers for flagship social network Facebook, whose growth has slowed in recent years.\n\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru and Katie Paul in New York; Additional reporting by Noel Randewich in Oakland, California, and Sheila Dang in Dallas; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila, Kenneth Li and Matthew Lewis)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@theprint.in", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capital expenditure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Lewis_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Lewis (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_analyst", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial analyst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 60}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Meta investors face a stark choice - TechCentral", "body": "Meta Platforms investors must ask themselves one thing about Mark Zuckerberg: do they trust him?\n\nMeta Platforms investors must ask themselves one thing about Mark Zuckerberg: do they trust him?\n\nExpectations were high for the first quarter after the wild success of the fourth quarter last year, which spurred the biggest value gain in the history of the US stock market. Those hopes were dashed by the results on Wednesday, with shares sliding by as much as 19% in after-hours trading.\n\nInvestors seemed unhappy primarily about three things:\n\nSpeaking to investors, Zuckerberg pleaded for trust and loyalty, citing previous challenges in Meta's 20-year history, such as the transition from desktop to mobile and the introduction of important new features like Instagram Stories and Reels.\n\nIn those cases, investors baulked at costs, questioning whether Meta would eventually be able to slot advertising into those innovations in a way that would prove sufficiently lucrative. Zuckerberg's point was that the company succeeded on all of those fronts and can do it again with artificial intelligence, though it may take years. \"Historically,\" he said, \"investing to build these new scaled experiences in our apps has been a very good long-term investment for us and for investors who have stuck with us.\"\n\nThe scale of this current undertaking, however, is far greater in cost, ambition and risk than anything that has come before it. In fact, it's not even remotely close. Building and running AI models requires extraordinarily expensive amounts of computing power when just about every tech giant -- and many non-tech companies, too -- is scrambling to buy hardware that is in short supply.\n\nEven if Meta can obtain the necessary resources -- and it's making great progress on that front -- there are still questions about how well this technology will actually work. Will businesses be willing to let an AI bot, with all of its potential hallucinations, go out and interact with their customers? Will the quality of AI-generated ads satisfy advertisers' standards? And will AI targeting be accurate enough to place those ads in front of the right people at the right price?\n\nOn the consumer side, what desire is there among normal users to interact with AI tools? The company's wide roll-out of Meta AI this past week, its most significant foray into consumer AI yet, put the chatbots front and centre in some of the world's most popular apps: WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger and Facebook. These apps now attract 3.24 billion people every day. But some are asking: what do I do with this, exactly?\n\nMaking things more difficult for Zuckerberg is that while his track record is good, there is a lingering problem with the \"metaverse\", a bet that has shown only minimal signs of paying off, just as AI might not. Last year, the company's Reality Labs unit lost $16.1-billion. In this year's first quarter, it lost an additional $3.9-billion. Zuckerberg tried to convince investors that spending wasn't all being put towards his passion project. \"We need to find better ways to articulate the value\" of Reality Labs, he said.\n\nZuckerberg did throw out some morsels that suggested things were on the right track. On AI, he said around 30% of recommended content on Facebook is now driven by AI, as is more than half of what people see on Instagram. This is good for increasing engagement and, therefore, good for ads.\n\nAnd with Reality Labs, he said the company had been highly encouraged by the early sales of its Ray-Ban smart glasses, which recently gained the ability, thanks to AI, to describe what users see in front of them. The glasses were sold out in many places, Zuckerberg said -- though he didn't provide any context on how many sales that actually meant. Still, he said a significant market for fashionable AI-powered glasses had arrived sooner than he thought. Investors should be excited about the possibilities it brings.\n\nAnd maybe that's how these earnings should be viewed -- through AI sunglasses, ideally rose-coloured, shielding some of the harsher details. If Zuckerberg's right, and all these research strands come together, Meta may well be on its way, as he said, to being the \"leading AI company in the world\". It's up to investors whether they back him -- or want to hop off the journey now. -- Dave Lee, (c) 2024 Bloomberg LP", "source": {"uri": "techcentral.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechCentral"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smartglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray-Ban", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ray-Ban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://techcentral.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/mark-zuckerberg-1500-800.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

After a rapid path through Congress, President Joe Biden signed a new law requiring Chinese internet company ByteDance to sell the US end of its TikTok service or see it banned from the country's mobile app stores. The wildly popular viral video platform, which once seemed an existential threat to Meta's Facebook and Instagram, looked to have been defanged.\n\nBy the end of the day, however, that was long forgotten. An unpleasant shock from Meta's latest earnings report initially wiped $200bn from its stock market value. With its ambitions around artificial intelligence growing, the company warned of an unexpected leap in costs and capital investment, with no promise of exactly when the increased spending would pay off.\n\nThe midweek whiplash for Meta shareholders speaks volumes about how fast the focus of competition has shifted in the tech world. Four years ago, before Meta (then Facebook) launched its own short video service, Reels, TikTok was seen as the greatest threat to its dominance. But the opportunity -- and perils -- from generative AI have opened a new wave of direct competition between the tech giants that could far exceed the perceived threat TikTok once posed.\n\nThe fact that Meta's share price hasn't responded to the action against TikTok is partly due to the uncertainties that still hang around the move. An attempt to ban the service in 2020 failed in court, and a legal challenge is expected on free-speech grounds. This time around, congressional leaders believe that stressing the national security risks posed by the Chinese-owned service will carry the day.\n\nEven if the new law were to result in TikTok being shut down completely in the US, the financial effects for Meta would be minimal. TikTok generated around $6bn from US advertising last year, according to digital advertising analyst Brian Wieser -- a drop in the bucket compared to the $138bn in advertising Meta produced.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's sights are no longer fixed on TikTok. He was clear this week about where he plans to spend most of his time for at least the next two years: on AI, a technology he claimed would carry Meta well beyond its social media roots. Zuckerberg has a new pitch: \"Creator AIs\", personalised chatbots and agents that he hopes will provide a much more engaging way to reach customers.\n\nThe idea of chatbots is hardly new -- Facebook has tried them before without success. But what was new this week was the depth of Zuckerberg's enthusiasm for the idea, and the extent to which he is swinging his company's resources behind the new wave of generative AI.\n\nMeta had been a latecomer to the large language model party, dominated by OpenAI and Google. Its decision last year to release its own model in open-source form was seen as a clever way to make up for lost time. By offering a way for others in the tech world to use the technology themselves, Meta increased its influence and potentially reduced the costs of maintaining the technology. But the company's CEO said this week that progress since then had given him a whole different view.\n\nIn Zuckerberg's latest vision, the pursuit of AI is no longer just about finding new ways to boost engagement on the company's social networks or improve the effectiveness of its advertising. Instead, it will have a far more dramatic impact, carrying Meta well beyond the social networking world that has defined the company in its first 20 years of existence. It is now bent on building AI-powered agents capable of carrying out complex tasks for its users, throwing it into direct competition with Google and the Microsoft/OpenAI partnership.\n\n\"We have shown we can build leading models and be the leading AI company in the world,\" Zuckerberg declared.\n\nNo wonder Wall Street has caught fright. Eighteen months ago his insistence that Meta was all-in on its big bet on the Metaverse hammered the share price. The stock has since risen nearly fivefold, thanks largely to a reversal of course that saw Zuckerberg slash the Metaverse spending and promise a new focus on cost efficiency.\n\nThis week, everything has changed again. Meta's new pursuit of AI agents as providing the key to the next era of online activity has brought head-on competition between the biggest tech companies a step closer. And for now, the Meta chief executive is making no promises about when the pay-off will come.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ByteDance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ByteDance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252F1c3ea254-c0f6-4bf6-895c-a4fee8d59a7f.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900&overlay=https://www.ft.com/__assets/creatives/x/ft-overlay.png&overlay_height=0.15&overlay_y=30&overlay_gravity=south_east", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, the stock was down 15 per cent in after-hours trading. Expectations are everything in markets,\" Charlie Bilello, Creative Planning's Chief Market Strategist said on platform X, which was formerly known as Twitter.\n\nMeta reported impressive earnings for the first quarter, with revenue climbing 27 per cent to reach $36.46 billion. This marked the fifth consecutive quarter of accelerated growth for the company.\n\nNet income also saw a substantial increase, more than doubling to $12.37 billion, or $4.71 per share, compared to $5.71 billion, or $2.20 per share, in the same period last year.\n\nA significant factor contributing to the surge in net income was a notable decrease in sales and marketing expenses, which dropped by 16 per cent from the previous year. Additionally, advertising revenue, Meta's primary source of income, saw a significant increase of 27 per cent in the first quarter, reaching $35.64 billion.\n\nMeta attributed its growth to several factors, including a stabilizing economy and increased spending from Chinese discount retailers like Temu and Shein.\n\nHowever, analysts have raised concerns about the potential impact of a slowdown in Chinese advertising spending in the future.\n\nLooking ahead, Meta expects second-quarter sales to fall between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, with a midpoint of $37.75 billion, slightly below analysts' expectations of $38.3 billion.\n\nAdditionally, Meta revised its expense forecast for the year, anticipating higher investments in new AI products and computing infrastructure. The company now projects total expenses for 2024 to be between $96 billion and $99 billion, with capital expenditure ranging from $30 billion to $40 billion.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Meta's stock price plummeted to $418.85 in extended trading, resulting in a market capitalization drop to approximately $1 trillion. This decline erased nearly $200 billion from its market value.\n\nDespite this setback, Meta has had a strong performance year-to-date, with over a 40 per cent increase in its stock price. The company's involvement in generative AI has been a significant driver of its growth, leading to a new record high earlier this month.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times, Thomas Monteiro, a senior analyst at Investing.com, stated, \"Meta's earnings should serve as a stark warning for companies reporting this earnings season.\"\n\nDespite the company's robust results, Monteiro emphasized that \"it didn't matter as much as the reported lowering revenue expectations for the current quarter.\" He added, \"Investors are currently looking at the near future with heavy mistrust,\" as reported by The New York Times.", "source": {"uri": "cityam.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CityAM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vivek_kumar@cityam.com", "name": "Vivek Kumar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discount_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discount store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital expenditure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investing.com", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investing.com"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.cityam.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1344800246.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

At that time, the company was reeling from Apple's iOS privacy update and macroeconomic concerns that led many brands to rein in spending.\n\nZuckerberg spearheaded an initiative to rebuild the ad business with a focus on artificial intelligence. On the company's last earnings call in February, finance chief Susan Li said Meta has been investing in AI models that can accurately predict relevant ads for users, as well as tools that automate the ads-creation process.\n\nAnalysts expect Meta to report a 26% increase in revenue from $28.65 billion a year earlier. That would mark the fastest rate of growth since the third quarter of 2021, which was before Apple's privacy change started to show up on other companies' balance sheets.\n\nMeta is benefiting from a stabilizing economy and surge in spending from Chinese discount retailers like Temu and Shein, which have been pumping money into Facebook and company-owned Instagram in an effort to reach a wider swath of users. Analysts at Baird said in a Monday note that slower spending from China-based advertisers could be a source of concern in the first-quarter results.\n\nStill, the Baird analysts see continuing momentum for Meta, and said they have \"reasonably high\" expectations for the company because of its improving advertiser tools and success in short-form video monetization.\n\nInvestors will remain focused on Meta's costs, which have been central to the stock rally. Early last year, Zuckerberg said the company would be better at eliminating unnecessary projects and cracking down on bloat, which would help Meta become a \"stronger and more nimble organization.\"\n\nThe company cut about 21,000 jobs in the first half of 2023, and Zuckerberg said in February of this year that hiring will be \"relatively minimal compared to what we would have done historically.\"\n\nAs of Dec. 31, Meta had a global workforce of 67,317, down from a peak of more than 87,000 employees in 2022, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.\n\nJefferies analysts wrote in a report last week that it's \"hard to argue with excellence.\" The analysts expect Meta to beat on its first-quarter results and provide better-than-expected guidance for the second quarter. As of now, the average analyst estimate calls for revenue growth of 20% in the second quarter to $38.29 billion, according to LSEG.\n\n\"We continue to be encouraged by META's ability to sustain double-digit rev growth, given the combination of higher engagement from AI investments, and increasing advertiser ROI & efficiency,\" the Jefferies analysts wrote.\n\nMeta's Reality Labs unit, which houses the company's hardware and software for development of the nascent metaverse, continues to bleed cash. Analysts expect the division to show an operating loss of $4.31 billion for the quarter, on top of the $42 billion it's lost since the end of 2020. Revenue in the unit is projected to reach $512.5 million, a 51% increase from $339 million a year earlier.\n\nExecutives will discuss the company's results on a call with analysts at 5 p.m. ET.", "source": {"uri": "nbcdfw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Li", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Susan Li"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reality Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://media.nbcdfw.com/2024/04/107131933-1665418142088-gettyimages-1327685522-kd1_0333_20210708121128478.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-31", "textStart": 2173, "textEnd": 2180}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

But its share price slumped 10% as the company reported earnings Wednesday due to a weak sales forecast rattling investors.\n\nRevenue at the world's largest social media business increased to $36.46bn during the first quarter in contrast to analyst expectations of $36.16bn. Earnings per share rose to $4.71, surpassing expectations on Wall Street of $4.32.\n\nRelated: Meta steps up AI battle with OpenAI and Google with release of Llama 3\n\nThe number that spooked investors was Meta's revenue guidance for next quarter: $37.75bn, a growth of about 18%. Analysts had predicted around $38.3bn.\n\nShares in Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp, were down sharply in after-hours trading. The group did not issue a dividend to investors for the first quarter of 2024, having done so for the first time in its history in the last quarter, which bolstered investors' confidence.\n\n\"It's been a good start to the year,\" Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. \"The new version of Meta AI with Llama 3 is another step towards building the world's leading AI. We're seeing healthy growth across our apps and we continue making steady progress building the metaverse as well.\"\n\nTikTok, a key competitor, is facing extreme regulatory pressure and uncertainty, leading investors to put their money in safer bets. The day before Meta reported earnings, the Senate approved a bill that would ban TikTok if it were not sold to an American company. Joe Biden has said he will sign the legislation.\n\nMeta's shares have rallied by nearly 40% this year. Investors have cheered Zuckerberg's and the company's pivot from investment in its metaverse products to spending big on artificial intelligence.\n\nLast week, the company announced it would integrate its partially released Llama 3 large language model across its platforms. The Meta AI assistant will also roll out to Australia, Canada, Singapore, Nigeria and Pakistan. The company also said it would add real-time image generation to its social networks.\n\nInvestors also gave their blessing to Zuckerberg's declaration of a \"year of efficiency\" in 2023, which in practical terms meant four sweeping rounds of layoffs. According to the earnings report, the company's workforce was down 10% since last year. The company cut more than 20,000 jobs, reducing its headcount to a figure similar to that of 2021. The company had doubled its workforce from 2020.\n\nRegulatory headwinds have formed a dark cloud on the horizon, however. Zuckerberg testified at a congressional hearing earlier this year, during which lawmakers raised the prospect of stripping Meta of its primary shield from legal liability for what its users post.\n\nAdvocates say Meta fails to adequately protect children, and some lawmakers agree. New Mexico's attorney general is suing the company for allegedly facilitating child predation. More than 30 states are suing the company for allegedly endangering teens' mental health.\n\nSpeaking to parents at the hearing whose children had killed themselves after facing harassment and sex trafficking via social media, Zuckerberg said: \"I'm sorry for all that you have been through.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Advertising revenue also saw a 27% rise year over year, reaching $35.64 billion, exceeding the estimated $35.57 billion.\n\nAccording to analysts, Meta is poised for continued strength in the future due to several factors, but the majority of price targets have been reduced.\n\nGoldman Sachs is bullish on Meta, noting its advantageous position in the advertising landscape. The firm anticipates continued investments in digital channels and the expansion of digital products, such as short-form video monetization exemplified by Instagram Reels. Goldman Sachs rates Meta stock as a 'Buy' with a 12-month price target of $500 from $555.\n\nJPMorgan also holds a positive outlook on Meta, considering it a top choice among internet stocks due to its scale, growth trajectory, and profitability. The bank attributes Meta's success to its strong competitive edge and user-centric approach. JPMorgan rates Meta shares as 'Overweight' with a $480 price target from $535.\n\nWells Fargo highlights Meta's rapid growth, mainly driven by its advancing AI capabilities and a thriving e-commerce environment. Wells Fargo rates Meta as 'Overweight' with a $600 price target.\n\nBank of America emphasizes Meta's undervalued AI assets and anticipates favorable revenue momentum fueled by enhancements in products like Reels and Messaging. Bank of America rates Meta as a 'Buy' with a $550 price target.\n\nDespite posting a double beat on expectations, Meta shares plunged to $431.13 as of the time of writing, notching a 12.64% decrease in the pre-market.\n\nThis loss likely stems from Meta Platforms' tempered projections for Q2. Initially, Wall Street seemed displeased with these forecasts, leading to shares plummeting nearly 20% at one juncture. However, there has been a partial recovery since then.\n\nThis recovery looks set to continue in the coming days, as Meta Platforms remains one of the stock market favorites.\n\nBuy stocks now with eToro - trusted and advanced investment platform", "source": {"uri": "finbold.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Finbold"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elmaz_sabovic@finbold.com", "name": "Elmaz Sabovic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World population"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JPMorgan Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EToro", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EToro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://assets.finbold.com/uploads/2024/04/Analysts-revise-Meta-stock-price-targets-after-earnings-1-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

The big pullback in the stock price came after the company released its first-quarter earnings report.\n\nInterestingly, the social media specialist's report actually included some pretty upbeat data about Q1 itself. Revenue and earnings per share (EPS), for instance, were both ahead of analysts' average forecasts for the two metrics. So why did the stock fall?\n\nProbably because of Meta's guidance. Not only did it say it's now expecting to spend more on capital expenditures during 2024 than it previously anticipated, but its second-quarter revenue guidance implies a significant deceleration in its year-over-year growth rate.\n\nFirst-quarter results\n\nMeta's first-quarter financial performance was quite impressive. Total revenue rose 27% year over year to $36.5 billion, beating analysts' consensus forecast for about $36.2 billion.\n\nThis top-line performance put the figure at the high end of management's guidance for the period for revenue between $34.5 and $37 billion. Further, this marked an acceleration from the 25% year-over-year revenue growth Meta reported in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nSuch strong sales growth, combined with benefits from the company's increasing focus on efficiency, unsurprisingly led to significant operating margin expansion and, ultimately, a more than doubling in earnings per share. Meta's operating margin expanded from 25% in the year-ago quarter to 38%, while earnings per share rose 114% to $4.71.\n\nThis performance was fueled by healthy user metrics, including a 7% year-over-year increase in daily users across its platforms, a 20% jump in ad impressions, and a 6% boost in average price per ad.\n\nThese strong results put cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of the period at about $58 billion, even as Meta spent approximately $14.6 billion buying back its stock and paid out $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders.\n\nGuidance\n\nConsidering Meta's incredible first-quarter results, the company's guidance for a slowdown is a bit surprising. Management's outlook for second-quarter revenue of between $36.5 billion and $39 billion implies 18% year-over-year growth -- a dramatic deceleration from the 27% growth the company reported in Q1.\n\nSuch a significant expected pullback in its top-line year-over-year growth rate may cause some investors to worry. They might be asking: Could growth slow even more in the coming quarters?\n\nThis is particularly concerning in a high-interest-rate environment like the ones consumers are in today. Investors are looking for clues as to whether or not this will negatively impact consumers to the point that advertisers start being more judicious about their marketing budgets.\n\nAnother reason Meta investors may be disappointed is the company increased its outlook for capital expenditures for the full year. Management said it now expects to spend between $35 billion and $40 billion, up from a previous forecast for $30 billion to $37 billion. This increase is due to a continued acceleration of Meta's infrastructure investments to support its artificial intelligence (AI) product development, said Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li in the company's first-quarter earnings report.\n\nSlowing growth combined with higher-than-expected capital expenditures are definitely good reasons for investors to be incrementally cautious.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

Mark Zuckerberg started the session with his confidence and ambitions of artificial intelligence, and then he slowly shifted his talk to the metaverse and puffed his company's operating system, its new headset, and smart glasses.\n\nZuckerberg focuses on AI plans\n\nWell, investors were looking for revenue generation, but they found ways how the cash will slip so Meta stock started falling and went as low as 19% yesterday, erasing a little more than $200 billion from the company's market cap. The stocks fell even though Meta beat expectations, however, investors wanted more, and the company did not live up to Wall Street's expectations.\n\nZuckerberg seemed to be expecting the dumping and recalled the metaverse-inflicted offloading and also investments in Reels and Stories. He said,\n\n\"I think it's worth calling that out, that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it.\"\n\nHe mentioned ads, but in plans for the future about how his company can incorporate them into the products that they are investing in now to generate revenues, despite the fact that Meta's revenue generation model is based on ad performance, and they get their 98% revenue from this same channel.\n\nMeta is under pressure again after a year of regaining investors' confidence\n\n2022 was a tough year for Meta, when metaverse spending and lighter revenues freaked investors out and it took a big bite out of the company's value. But last year, the company came back into Wall Street's good books again as it saw a three-fold increase in its stock and was 40% up this year, the highest it reached was $527 earlier this month.\n\nThe company's downsizing of its staff and closing of projects that were not important played a good role in gaining investors' confidence, which was part of Zuckerberg's cost-cutting strategy that he initiated at the start of 2023, when he announced it to be the \"year of efficiency.\" The CEO repeated that his efficiency policy will continue but will also shift resources to investments in AI.\n\nCapital expenditures forecast was increased by almost $3 billion to $5 billion, as they are now expected to be between $35 billion to $40 billion, which were previously expected to remain under $37 billion as the company is increasing its investment in infrastructure to facilitate its AI projects.\n\nZuckerberg told investors that they would have to be patient for better rewards.

including the Reality Labs unit - jumped 50.7 per cent on an annual basis to more than $820 million.\n\nThe company expects its 2024 capital expenditure to hover in the range of $30 billion and $35 billion, a $3 billion increase in the high end of its earlier range, as it accelerates its infrastructure investments to support its AI road map.\n\nMs Li said capital expenditures will continue to increase in 2025 as Meta invests \"aggressively to support ambitious AI research and product development efforts\".\n\nAfter Meta's ambitious AI road map and escalating capital expenditure, analysts are optimistic.\n\n\"Meta still has several growth drivers that are likely to produce pick-up throughout the year as the company implements less ad-reliant monetisation strategies,\" Mr Monteiro said.\n\n\"Both WhatsApp and the Metaverse show promise in that area and could be the drivers of the next leg up for the company.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alkesh_sharma@thenationalnews.com", "name": "Alkesh Sharma", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reality Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_users", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Active users"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital expenditure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investing.com", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investing.com"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/QMYP5W557RLI4X5T6VUMIHM64M.jpg?smart=true&auth=c540e8a4ffc055b1b2f94bad6255980cddc30bd7cc854ea598d2538e69e6054d&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Shares of Meta have been on a tear, climbing 116% over the last 12 months and more than 45% year to date. That's far better than chief rival Google (GOOG, GOOGL) which is up 45% in the last 12 months and 16% year to date.\n\nWhile part of Meta's stock performance has to do with a recovery in the digital advertising market, the company's stock price truly rocketed higher last quarter after the social media company announced it was initiating a $0.50 per share dividend and increased its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion.\n\nFor the first quarter, Wall Street is expecting Meta to report earnings per share of $4.30 on revenue of $36.1 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would mark another huge jump in EPS and revenue from the same quarter last year when the company reported earnings of $2.20 on revenue of $28.6 billion.\n\nBut JPMorgan Securities analyst Doug Anmuth says Meta's growth spike could face trouble in the coming months.\n\n\"There is growing caution into earnings on almost-certain growth deceleration beyond 1Q due to tough [comparisons] & perception of lack of new drivers vs. [2023],\" Anmuth wrote in a recent earnings note.\n\nWedbush analyst Scott Devitt was equally cautious in his own analyst note, saying that he will be primarily focused on \"the pace of expected growth in 2Q and 2H24 against more challenging comps.\"\n\nDespite that potential headwind, Meta has a number of strengths going its way, including its continued effort in combating TikTok with its Reels platform. The company has also emerged as a potential early winner in the AI space, with the technology set to improve Meta's overall advertising capabilities.\n\nMeta has made a series of announcements regarding its AI efforts in recent months, including debuting its Meta AI chatbot and Llama 3 large language model on April 18. The chatbot, however, has already garnered controversy after it joined a private Facebook group for mothers in Manhattan and claimed to have a child of its own, 404 Media reported.\n\nThe bot, which is available across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messages, and the Meta.AI website, also can't be turned off even if users don't want to use it.\n\nDespite Meta's increased emphasis on AI, CEO Mark Zuckerberg isn't giving up on his quest to bring his vision for the metaverse to life. On Monday, he took a further step toward increasing the number of AR/VR headsets on the market, announcing that Meta will make its Horizon operating system for headsets open source, allowing third-party companies to use it to build their own devices.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

This growth marks a continuation of the positive momentum seen in the previous quarter and highlights Meta's effective recovery from challenges such as Apple's privacy updates, which previously wiped-out significant revenue streams.\n\nThe key driver behind this exceptional performance has been Meta's significant strides in AI technology, particularly with the introduction of its latest large language model, Llama 3. This model enhances Meta's ad-targeting capabilities, allowing for more precise and effective advertising strategies. Llama 3, which has capabilities such as generating images and summarizing articles, was recently integrated into popular Meta apps like Instagram and WhatsApp. This integration is expected to not only improve user engagement but also open new avenues for ad placement and innovation.\n\nMarket Overview:\n\n-Meta delivers strong Q1 earnings, exceeding analyst expectations but disappoints with cautious Q2 revenue guidance.\n\n-The company's AI advancements continue to bolster its advertising business, showcasing its potential in a privacy-focused landscape.\n\nKey Points:\n\n-Meta records its best-ever first-quarter revenue of $36.5 billion, fueled by AI-powered ad targeting.\n\n-New large language model, Llama 3, signifies Meta's commitment to AI and potentially fosters user trust.\n\n-Despite impressive revenue growth, Meta's Q2 guidance falls short of analyst expectations, causing a stock price decline.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\n-Meta's ability to maintain its advertising dominance hinges on the continued success of its AI initiatives.\n\n-Investor confidence will depend on the company's ability to translate AI investments into future revenue growth.\n\n-Transparency and responsible development of AI tools will be crucial for Meta to maintain user trust.\n\nDespite these achievements, Meta's future projections have introduced some caution into the narrative. The company provided a softer revenue forecast for the second quarter, projecting between $36.5 billion to $39 billion, which, at the midpoint, would represent an 18% year-over-year growth -- below the average analyst estimate of $38.3 billion. This conservative outlook led to an 11% drop in Meta's shares in extended trading, reflecting investor concerns about the sustained ability of the company to grow at the previously observed pace.\n\nMoving forward, Meta appears well-positioned to continue its growth trajectory, especially with its AI-driven innovations gaining traction. However, the cautious revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter and ongoing concerns about heavy investments in AI technology and their implications for profitability will be critical points of discussion in Meta's upcoming analysts' call. Investors and analysts alike will be keenly watching how the company plans to balance its ambitious technological advancements with financial prudence to ensure long-term sustainability.", "source": {"uri": "quiverquant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "quiverquant.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_engagement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer engagement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Meta_Headquarters_Sign.jpg/640px-Meta_Headquarters_Sign.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

(Photo: AMY OSBORNE/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIn Meta's recent call for its first-quarter earnings report, CEO Mark Zuckerberg provided insights to investors regarding the company's engagement in the burgeoning field of generative AI.\n\nExemplified by net income exceeding $12 billion and revenue reaching $36.5 billion in the last quarter alone, Mark Zuckerberg highlighted potential challenges. He noted an anticipated slowdown in revenue growth alongside heightened expenditures in AI and the metaverse.\n\nDespite these investments, Zuckerberg tempered expectations by indicating that profits from generative AI initiatives may not materialize in the near future.\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg expressed optimism about the long-term benefits of investing in new scaled experiences within Meta's apps.\n\nDrawing parallels to the successful rollouts of Stories and Reels, he emphasized the positive initial indicators for the company's latest endeavors. However, Zuckerberg cautioned that developing leading AI technologies would be a more extensive undertaking compared to previous app enhancements. He anticipated that achieving this goal would require several years of dedicated effort.\n\nThe Meta AI assistant has garnered traction among \"tens of millions of people\" since its widespread availability. This surge in usage is unsurprising, considering its prominent integration into areas such as the Instagram search box.\n\nHowever, the true measure of success lies in whether Meta AI becomes a regularly used product and if there is widespread demand for an AI assistant within social media platforms.\n\nIn the future, Meta envisions various monetization avenues for its assistant, which are currently offered free of charge.\n\nZuckerberg highlighted numerous avenues for significant business growth, including expanding business messaging, integrating advertisements or paid content into AI interactions, and offering premium features with larger AI models and enhanced computational capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, AI's role in enhancing app engagement is expected to lead to increased ad visibility and improved ad targeting, thereby delivering enhanced value to users.\n\nAlso read: Meta Integrates AI Image Generation with WhatsApp, Beta Launches in US\n\nZuckerberg hinted at potential improvements in ad quality through increased usage of Meta AI in the coming year. This strategy involves analyzing user interactions with the assistant to gain insights into their purchasing interests, signaling a departure from OpenAI's advertising approach.\n\nIn addition to its advancements in generative AI, Zuckerberg expressed optimism about Meta's smart glasses collaboration with Ray-Ban. During the call, he noted that various styles and colors of the glasses are currently sold out, highlighting the device's expanded availability of multimodal AI capabilities.\n\nHe expressed a previous belief that AR glasses required full holographic displays to gain widespread popularity.

A: Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Meta Platforms, Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO: The investment cycle for AI and Reality Labs could span several years, similar to past cycles with Stories and Reels.

( Image Source :Getty )\n\nThe investors of Meta appear to be running out of patience as the company aims to increase spending in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Meta's stock witnessed a dump of 15 per cent in extended trade after it forecasted higher spending in AI next year. The concession from Meta in its quarterly report allegedly has cast a cloud on other companies like Alphabet and Google as well that are expected to reveal their quarterly earnings soon.\n\nDuring Meta's earnings conference call, analysts bombarded CEO Mark Zuckerberg with questions about how Meta was pacing its AI investments. One of the analysts present there asked him whether Meta was spending more because it saw an even bigger opportunity from AI. Zuckerberg while responding said, \"I think we've gotten more ambitious and optimistic on AI. All of that basically encourages me to make sure that we're investing to stay at the leading edge of this.\"\n\nThe process of generating content using generative AI consumes a considerable amount of energy, which Mark Zuckerberg mentioned as a factor contributing to Meta's increased expenses.\n\nIn a recent research note, analysts from New Street Research highlighted concerns regarding Alphabet's potential for significantly higher capital expenditures, especially with the upcoming results on Thursday. The research firm revised its estimate for Alphabet's full-year capital expenditures to $45.9 billion, up from the earlier projection of $42.7 billion. Google so far has been pursuing advancements in generative AI like anything. It even recently introduced Gemini, a model capable of comprehending and generating various forms of content such as text, audio, and video.\n\nMicrosoft on the other hand stands tall as a frontrunner in AI, due to its collaboration with OpenAI.

The shares of the company took a downward turn despite having reported a robust result. Financial Times reports that the firm also raised its capex guidance, giving a hit to investor sentiments.\n\nAccording to The Financial Times, although Meta's revenues surged by more than 25% in the first three months of the year, above forecasts, the company's shares experienced a roughly 12% decline in after-hours trading on Wednesday due to Wall Street's reaction to its ongoing expenditure binge on artificial intelligence.\n\nAccording to an earnings report, the social media group's revenues increased by 27% to $36.5 billion, barely over analysts' projections of $36.2 billion. Meta increased its capital expenditure projection for the entire year by up to 40% from $37 billion, citing the need to \"continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap.\"\n\nRead Also: DOJ Arrests Samourai Wallet Duo for Laundering $100M\n\nThe commitment to spend on AI is not limited to just Meta. Tech behemoths across the globe are currently trying to mint good AI revenue or at least keep a continuous AI spending spree to be industry-dominant. More than two-thirds of jobs are anticipated to be impacted by AI in the future. Apple's recent announcement that it will concentrate on AI products moving forward is a great illustration of this.\n\nThis approach was motivated by IT corporations' desire to make money from artificial intelligence services. In addition, Microsoft is adding major firms in the same industry to broaden its offering in artificial intelligence technologies. In addition, as most businesses interact with AI products, persons seeking employment in the future will need to be proficient in a wide range of fields.\n\nApart from a commitment to keep its AI spending spree going in the future, Meta has recently also been venturing more into AI. A good example of this is Meta Platform beta versions of its new large language model, Llama 3. This release includes two implementations incorporated into popular platforms including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, and has strong computational capabilities designed to enhance the Meta AI virtual assistant.\n\nBy integrating these models with Meta AI, users can access more sophisticated and seamless digital assistance within their daily applications. In addition, the business has started advertising additional features of the AI assistant on a different website, indicating that it is moving into direct rivalry with companies that provide supposedly more sophisticated solutions, including OpenAI's ChatGPT.", "source": {"uri": "coingape.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coingape"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nausheen_thusoo@coingape.com", "name": "Nausheen Thusoo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Meta-introduces-LLaMA-to-compete-with-GPT-3-and-LaMDA.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Here's what it does  --  and whether you can turn it off", "body": "Meta introduced its AI-powered chatbot Meta AI across its social media and messaging platforms. The tool is similar to ChatGPT and Gemini, offering text generation and image creation. But it can't be disabled -- despite the AI chatbot previously saying that it could be.\n\nMeta released a new AI-powered assistant on its apps last week, and users can't seem to escape it, whether they want to or not.\n\nThe prompt \"ask Meta AI anything\" shows up whenever you click on the search bar in Instagram and Facebook. It also shows up as a chat on messaging apps Messenger and WhatsApp.\n\nThe newly released Llama 3 LLM powers the tool, and Meta calls it \"the most intelligent AI assistant you can use for free.\" It's also available in 12 countries outside the US.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday in a first-quarter earnings call that the company is on its path \"to having the most used and best AI assistant in the world.\"\n\nBut some social media fans aren't happy about the change, with one X post comparing it to \"when Apple force-download that U2 album onto everyone's iPhone.\" So Business Insider took a look at what the AI does, how it competes against other chatbots -- and if there is a way of avoiding the technology.\n\nWhat it does\n\nMeta AI is similar to other AI chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Gemini. According to the tool, it can help with a \"wide range of topics, from general knowledge to more specific questions.\" That includes generating text, offering suggestions, and creating images.\n\nUsers can access Meta AI in their feeds, chats, and search. They can also view the history of conversations in the chat section on Messenger and Instagram.\n\nThe tool is free for Meta users and can be used without exiting your app. It can also create AI-generated images by asking it to \"imagine\" a description of what you want the image to be.\n\nUsers can make GIFs, too, by asking the chatbot to animate the image. The assistant can make a moving photo -- although the GIFs aren't like the general meme ones offered in iPhone messaging to add humor or commentary to conversations.\n\nHow does it compare to other AI chatbots?\n\nThe main difference that separates Meta AI from other chatbots is the ability to use it when you're in the social media app without exiting the app (ChatGPT, for example, is a stand-alone app). It's the first tool automatically implemented into multiple social media platforms.\n\nZuckerberg previously told The Verge that the goal with Llama 3 \"wasn't to build something that was way ahead\" but to bring AI to platforms like Facebook and Instagram.\n\nBut despite being available on the app, Meta AI isn't automatically connected to your social media accounts or personal information. If you ask it how many Instagram followers you have, it will ask you to share your username, and then it will tell you to look at the account yourself.\n\nCan you turn it off?\n\nUnlike other chatbots that you can use at your own will, you can't get rid of Meta AI.\n\nSince its release, the tool has created quite an online stir, with users questioning the ability to turn it on or off. According to many, the chatbot also originally incorrectly said it could be disabled and provided instructions to do so when asked.\n\nMeta seems to have fixed that issue because the chatbot now says it can't be removed.\n\nBut if users don't want to use it, they can search regularly on Instagram or Facebook without typing inquiries for the assistant. And on WhatsApp and Messenger, users can just ignore the Meta AI chats since they're not available in the search bar.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_altchek@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Ana Altchek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instant messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GIF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/662a543a0dfb1341e9fefa63?format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Even if they do not yet know what Meta will reveal in its earnings report, they are worried about inflation. As the inflation rate increases and is showing little sign of diminishing, it places all companies in the unenviable position of having to perform better than ever to reassure their shareholders.\n\nThe second problem that Meta faces is in the area of spending.

The shares of the company took a downward turn despite having reported a robust result. Financial Times reports that the firm also raised its capex guidance, giving a hit to investor sentiments.\n\nAccording to The Financial Times, although Meta's revenues surged by more than 25% in the first three months of the year, above forecasts, the company's shares experienced a roughly 12% decline in after-hours trading on Wednesday due to Wall Street's reaction to its ongoing expenditure binge on artificial intelligence.\n\nAccording to an earnings report, the social media group's revenues increased by 27% to $36.5 billion, barely over analysts' projections of $36.2 billion. Meta increased its capital expenditure projection for the entire year by up to 40% from $37 billion, citing the need to \"continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap.\"\n\nRead Also: DOJ Arrests Samourai Wallet Duo for Laundering $100M\n\nThe commitment to spend on AI is not limited to just Meta. Tech behemoths across the globe are currently trying to mint good AI revenue or at least keep a continuous AI spending spree to be industry-dominant. More than two-thirds of jobs are anticipated to be impacted by AI in the future. Apple's recent announcement that it will concentrate on AI products moving forward is a great illustration of this.\n\nThis approach was motivated by IT corporations' desire to make money from artificial intelligence services. In addition, Microsoft is adding major firms in the same industry to broaden its offering in artificial intelligence technologies. In addition, as most businesses interact with AI products, persons seeking employment in the future will need to be proficient in a wide range of fields.\n\nApart from a commitment to keep its AI spending spree going in the future, Meta has recently also been venturing more into AI. A good example of this is Meta Platform beta versions of its new large language model, Llama 3. This release includes two implementations incorporated into popular platforms including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, and has strong computational capabilities designed to enhance the Meta AI virtual assistant.\n\nBy integrating these models with Meta AI, users can access more sophisticated and seamless digital assistance within their daily applications. In addition, the business has started advertising additional features of the AI assistant on a different website, indicating that it is moving into direct rivalry with companies that provide supposedly more sophisticated solutions, including OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nRead Also: Breaking: EU Parliament Passes AML Regulation\n\nThe post Meta's Continued AI Spending Spree Overshadows Robust Q1 Earnings appeared first on CoinGape.", "source": {"uri": "cryptorank.io", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoRank"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Meta-introduces-LLaMA-to-compete-with-GPT-3-and-LaMDA.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Zuckerberg's also been praised for some of his strategies around Meta's AI development, including the decision to open-source models and stockpile GPUs.\n\nWhile Meta's AI products, including Llama 3, have been generally well received, the company is not selling any version of its newest AI model, which is largely open source.\n\nBut while investors seemed willing to overlook spending concerns at the height of the AI boom in exchange for flashy product promises, the response to Zuckerberg's lavish spending shows this enthusiasm has its limits.\n\nOn the call, Zuckerberg warned investors: \"Building the leading AI will also be a larger undertaking than the other experiences we've added to our apps, and this is likely going to take several years on the upside once our new AI services reach scale.\"\n\nMeta also has an image problem.\n\nDespite years of investment in AI, the Facebook owner was not seen as an AI leader in the same way as Google, nor has it been able to control the post-ChatGPT narrative as successfully as Microsoft.\n\nJust months before OpenAI first launched ChatGPT in late 2022, Meta suffered an embarrassing setback after releasing its own AI chatbot called BlenderBot. The bot proved to be obsessed with conspiracy theories, prompting users to call it \"incompetent.\"\n\nMeta has since solidified its AI reputation, with later releases praised by developers. Zuckerberg's newest AI model even received a nod of approval from old rival Elon Musk.\n\nHowever, investors may be wary of Zuckerberg's tendency to jump the gun on a technology he's excited about.\n\nIt's not the first time he's announced huge spending for a new passion project -- Meta's heavy metaverse spending and subsequent stock slide are unlikely to be far from analysts' minds.\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, made outside normal working hours.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "beatrice_nolan@businessinsider.com", "name": "Beatrice Nolan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open source model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GPT-4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/662a38c623b29110d302d549?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

At the same time, the company is dedicating significant resources to AI development and the metaverse.\n\nDuring the earnings call, Zuckerberg highlighted the profitable nature of investing in the development of these new immersive features within our applications.\n\nHe drew comparisons to past successful launches like Stories and Reels, emphasizing the potential for similar outcomes. Nevertheless, he acknowledged that establishing the forefront of artificial intelligence will require a more extensive effort compared to previous app improvements, potentially spanning multiple years.\n\n\"There are numerous opportunities to develop a substantial business here, including expanding business messaging, integrating ads or paid content into AI interactions, and offering users the option to pay for access to larger AI models and enhanced computing power,\" Zuckerberg explained. \"Furthermore, AI is already enhancing app engagement, naturally leading to increased ad exposure and refining ad delivery to provide greater value.\"\n\nZuckerberg hinted that in the upcoming years, the utilization of Meta AI could potentially improve the effectiveness of its ads by studying how users engage with the virtual assistant to understand their buying habits.\n\n\"Much like every other technology which is in its infancy, Generative AI will take a few years to develop and deliver profits for the big tech companies which are investing billions of dollars in it. Generative AI will have significant returns which will reshape the big tech. For example, the cloud took more than 10 years to become profitable. However, it's still not profitable for all the cloud providers. Similarly, Generative AI will take a few years to become profitable.

The Meta bot's image generator also competes with AI imaging tools like Adobe's Firefly, Midjourney and DALL-E.\n\nUnlike other chatbots and image generators, Meta's AI assistant is a free tool baked into apps that billions of people use every day, making it the most aggressive push yet from a big tech company to bring this flavor of artificial intelligence -- known as generative AI -- to the mainstream.\n\n\"We believe Meta AI is now the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use,\" Mark Zuckerberg, the company's CEO, wrote on Instagram on April 18.\n\nThe new bot invites you to \"ask Meta AI anything\" -- but my advice, after testing it for six days, is to approach it with caution. It makes lots of mistakes when you treat it as a search engine. For now, you can have some fun: Its image generator can be a clever way to express yourself when chatting with friends.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said that because the technology was new, it might not always return accurate responses, similar to other AI systems. There is no way to turn off Meta AI inside the apps.\n\nHere's what doesn't work well -- and what does -- in Meta's AI.\n\nIt's not a search engine\n\nMeta announced its chatbot as a replacement for web search. By typing queries for Meta AI into the search bar at the top of Messenger or Instagram, a group of friends planning a trip could look up flights while chatting, the company said.\n\nI'll be blunt: Don't do this. Meta AI fails spectacularly at basic search queries like looking up recipes, airfares and weekend activities.\n\nIn response to my request to look up flights from New York to Colorado, the chatbot listed instructions on how to take public transportation from the Denver airport to downtown. And when I asked for flights from Oakland, California, to Puerto Vallarta in Mexico, the bot listed flights departing from Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nWhen I asked Meta AI to look up a recipe for baking Japanese milk bread, the bot produced a generic bread recipe that skipped the most important step: tangzhong, the technique that involves cooking flour and milk into a paste.\n\nThe AI also made up other basic information. When I asked it for suggestions for a romantic weekend in Oakland, its list included a fictional business. And when I asked it to tell me about myself -- Brian Chen the journalist -- it said I worked at The New York Times but incorrectly mentioned a tech blog I've never written for, The Verge.\n\nBing AI and Gemini, which are hooked directly into the Microsoft and Google search engines, did better at these types of search tasks, but clicking on a link through an old-fashioned web search is still more efficient.\n\nDon't ask it to count\n\nAI chatbots work by looking for patterns in how words are used together, similar to the predictive text systems on our phones that suggest words to complete a sentence. All of them have struggled with numbers.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Meta's assistant stinks at counting. When you ask it for a five-syllable word starting with the letter w, it will respond with \"wonderfully,\" which has four syllables. When you ask it for a four-syllable word starting with w, it will offer \"wonderful,\" which has three syllables. Gemini and ChatGPT also fail at these tests.\n\nFocus on words\n\nLike other chatbots, Meta's performed better the more information you gave it.\n\nIt excelled at editing existing paragraphs. For example, when I fed Meta AI paragraphs that felt verbose and asked for the paragraph to be tightened, the chatbot trimmed all the unnecessary words. When I asked it to improve a sentence written in passive voice, the bot rewrote it in active voice and added more context. When I asked it to remove jargon from a paragraph written by a tech blog, it rewrote highly technical terms in plain language.\n\nIt's a fine study guide\n\nBecause Meta AI is better when it works with existing text, it can be helpful for studying. For instance, if you're taking a history class and studying World War II, you can paste a website with information about the war into the search bar and then ask the bot to quiz you. The chatbot will read the information on the website and generate a multiple-choice test.\n\nYou can use it for fun emojis\n\nThe most compelling aspect of Meta AI is its ability to generate images by typing \"/imagine\" followed by a description of the desired image. For instance, \"/imagine a photograph of a cat sleeping on a window sill\" will produce a convincing image in a few seconds.\n\nMeta's AI is much faster than other image generators like Midjourney, which can take more than a minute. The results can be very weird -- images of people occasionally lacked limbs or looked cross-eyed.\n\nEthics experts have raised concerns about the implications of generating fake images because they can contribute to the spread of misinformation online. But in the context of using AI while chatting with friends and family in WhatsApp and Messenger, Meta AI is a positive example of how generating fake images can be fun -- and safe -- if we treat it as a new form of emoji.\n\nIn a group conversation with my in-laws, I mentioned I was shopping for a robust baby stroller that could withstand the crooked roads of my neighborhood. In seconds, my wife used Meta AI to generate an image of a stroller with enormous wheels that made it resemble a monster truck, stamped with a helpful label that said, \"Imagined with AI.\"",

Intel, which has missed out on the AI-led rally, was up 0.7% ahead of earnings.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who floored Wall Street last year with his cost-cutting drive, said on a post-earnings call that costs would grow \"meaningfully\" over the coming years before the company makes \"much revenue\" from some of its AI products.\n\nThat stoked investor fears that Zuckerberg was plunging Meta into another costly endeavor at a time when its augmented and virtual reality business was losing billions of dollars each quarter.\n\n\"Investors were caught off guard by higher capital expenditure, exacerbated by slightly softer second-quarter revenue guide. As such, shares are entering the 'penalty box,'\" Baird Equity Research analysts said.\n\nMeta forecast April-June revenue below estimates and raised the bottom end of its 2024 total expense forecast by $2 billion on Wednesday. It also raised the top end of its capital expenditure view as it invests in data centers essential to its efforts to catch up with AI frontrunners OpenAI and Microsoft.\n\nThe dour expectations follow a series of smash-hit earnings that helped Meta nearly triple its stock in 2023 and powered the biggest one-day market value gain by any company in Wall Street history, of $196 billion, in February after its maiden dividend.\n\nStill, several analysts were positive on the investments, pointing to AI-driven engagement on content such as Instagram Reels and the warm reception for its virtual assistant Meta AI and early versions of its latest large language model, Llama 3.\n\n\"We think this time it is different,\" Evercore ISI analysts said. \"This investment cycle comes from a position of strength, as management continues to see a healthy ad demand environment into Q2 and improving user engagement.\"\n\nOverall, 19 analysts lowered their price targets on the stock, while 13 raised their view, according to LSEG data. The median price target now stands at $525, which is about 6% higher than its previous close.\n\nThe stock has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 23.12, compared with Microsoft's 31.17 and Alphabet's 22.07. It has gained nearly 40% so far this year, comfortably above the benchmark S&P 500 index's .SPX 6% gain.\n\n\"Being on the offensive with investment spending is generally great, but in internet it is very hard to underwrite which of those investments will pay back and when,\" Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik said.\n\n\"All of this culminates with investors wondering just how long this investment

One analyst asked whether Meta was spending more because it saw an even bigger opportunity from AI.\n\n\"I think we've gotten more ambitious and optimistic on AI,\" Zuckerberg responded, pointing to Meta's recent launches of new AI models. \"So all of that basically encourages me to make sure that we're investing to stay at the leading edge of this.\"\n\nAlphabet and Microsoft both said earlier this year when they reported fourth-quarter results that they expected rising AI costs. The investor reaction on Wednesday indicated deepening concerns.\n\nIn a research note on Monday about Alphabet, analysts from New Street Research said the potential for materially higher capital expenditures was a worry ahead of results on Thursday.\n\nThe research firm said it now expects Alphabet's full-year capital expenditures to be $45.9 billion, up from its previous estimate of $42.7 billion.\n\nGoogle has been working to catch up in the generative AI race and released Gemini, a model that can understand and create different types of information including text, audio and video.\n\nCreating content with generative AI is energy-intensive, and Zuckerberg cited the cost as a reason for Meta's higher expenses.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft has positioned itself to be a winner in AI due to its partnership with OpenAI, which kicked off the generative AI craze last year with ChatGPT, said analysts from Jefferies in a note on March 31.\n\nMicrosoft has integrated chatbots into its suite of Office products and is planning to invest more in data centers.\n\nIndustry-wide, shareholders are now focused on looking for revenue, including pricing models and whether customers can find use cases that justify the cost of generative AI, Jefferies wrote.\n\n\"Last year was spent dreaming of gen AI's potential,\" the analysts wrote. \"This year will be about moving forward with concrete steps.\"", "source": {"uri": "telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETTelecom.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-109590870,imgsize-59912,width-1200,height=765,overlay-ettelecom/internet/ai-spending-worries-cast-gloom-over-alphabet-microsoft.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-31", "textStart": 2547, "textEnd": 2555}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

The launch of LLaMA 3 signals ongoing innovation, likely propelling Meta's market-leading growth.\n\nMeta's stock, lingering near $500 for weeks, closed at $499.76 on Tuesday. Optimistically ahead of Q1 earnings, analysts foresee the potential for shares to surpass $600. UBS upgraded Meta to a Buy, setting a $610 target, citing multiple growth factors.\n\nCiti (NYSE:C) analysts also recently upgraded Meta Platforms Inc. to buy, with a new price target of $590 per share. Analysts at this outfit attributed the optimistic view to increased engagement and advertising on Instagram Reels.\n\nInstagram Reels advertising load increased to 20% in Q1.\n\nUser engagement is attributed to recent innovations such as creative ads, reminder ads, and longer-form Reels. AI video architecture also contributes to growing interest in Reels among advertisers.\n\nCiti highlighted Entertainment, Apparel, and Technology as top advertising verticals with unaffected user engagement despite increased ad loads. They view the online advertising environment as strong, boosting confidence in Meta's market position. Their top pick is Meta with a price target of $590.\n\nMeta Platforms runs a successful online advertising platform. Q4 2023 marked a successful financial year end for Meta, with impressive figures including over 35% profit margin, 25% revenue growth, and a 201% increase in net income. Annual revenue and net income both saw a 16% and 69% boost, respectively.\n\nMoreover, Meta's broad set of apps like Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp has over billion of users worldwide. The daily active user metric is now 3.19 billion, with monthly users at 3.98 billion. User activity is growing strongly and steadily.\n\nThe company experienced broad growth in daily and active users. Daily active users rose 8% yearly across platforms and 6% on Facebook. Monthly active users reached 3.98 billion. Facebook had 3.07 billion monthly active users.\n\nThe stock doubled in a year, with analysts foreseeing further upside, rating it a Strong Buy with a projected 9% increase and a $600 per share target, suggesting a 20% rally.\n\nMeta Platforms remains a dominant force in social media, with Facebook and Instagram under their belt. Their robust ad platform attracts businesses of all sizes.\n\nDespite regulatory challenges, Meta explores AI for content moderation, notably LLM Llama 3. Financially strong after record FY23 revenue and FCF, Meta is poised as a top tech stock for 2024 and beyond.\n\nMeta is set to release its earnings report on April 24, with analysts raising price targets.

Here's what it does  --  and whether you can turn it off", "body": "By clicking \"Sign Up\", you accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. You can opt-out at any time.\n\nMeta released a new AI-powered assistant on its apps last week, and users can't seem to escape it, whether they want to or not.\n\nThe prompt \"ask Meta AI anything\" shows up whenever you click on the search bar in Instagram and Facebook. It also shows up as a chat on messaging apps Messenger and WhatsApp.\n\nThe newly released Llama 3 LLM powers the tool, and Meta calls it \"the most intelligent AI assistant you can use for free.\" It's also available in 12 countries outside the US.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday in a first-quarter earnings call that the company is on its path \"to having the most used and best AI assistant in the world.\"\n\nBut some social media fans aren't happy about the change, with one X post comparing it to \"when Apple force-download that U2 album onto everyone's iPhone.\" So Business Insider took a look at what the AI does, how it competes against other chatbots -- and if there is a way of avoiding the technology.\n\nMeta AI is similar to other AI chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Gemini. According to the tool, it can help with a \"wide range of topics, from general knowledge to more specific questions.\" That includes generating text, offering suggestions, and creating images.\n\nUsers can access Meta AI in their feeds, chats, and search. They can also view the history of conversations in the chat section on Messenger and Instagram.\n\nThe tool is free for Meta users and can be used without exiting your app. It can also create AI-generated images by asking it to \"imagine\" a description of what you want the image to be.\n\nUsers can make GIFs, too, by asking the chatbot to animate the image. The assistant can make a moving photo -- although the GIFs aren't like the general meme ones offered in iPhone messaging to add humor or commentary to conversations.\n\nThe main difference that separates Meta AI from other chatbots is the ability to use it when you're in the social media app without exiting the app (ChatGPT, for example, is a stand-alone app). It's the first tool automatically implemented into multiple social media platforms.\n\nZuckerberg previously told The Verge that the goal with Llama 3 \"wasn't to build something that was way ahead\" but to bring AI to platforms like Facebook and Instagram.\n\nBut despite being available on the app, Meta AI isn't automatically connected to your social media accounts or personal information. If you ask it how many Instagram followers you have, it will ask you to share your username, and then it will tell you to look at the account yourself.\n\nUnlike other chatbots that you can use at your own will, you can't get rid of Meta AI.\n\nSince its release, the tool has created quite an online stir, with users questioning the ability to turn it on or off. According to many, the chatbot also originally incorrectly said it could be disabled and provided instructions to do so when asked.\n\nMeta seems to have fixed that issue because the chatbot now says it can't be removed.\n\nBut if users don't want to use it, they can search regularly on Instagram or Facebook without typing inquiries for the assistant. And on WhatsApp and Messenger, users can just ignore the Meta AI chats since they're not available in the search bar.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_altchek@businessinsider.com", "name": "Ana Altchek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terms of service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instant messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GIF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/662a54740dfb1341e9fefa75?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

The big pullback in the stock price came after the company released its first-quarter earnings report.\n\nInterestingly, the social media specialist's report actually included some pretty upbeat data about Q1 itself. Revenue and earnings per share (EPS), for instance, were both ahead of analysts' average forecasts for the two metrics. So why did the stock fall?\n\nProbably because of Meta's guidance. Not only did it say it's now expecting to spend more on capital expenditures during 2024 than it previously anticipated, but its second-quarter revenue guidance implies a significant deceleration in its year-over-year growth rate.\n\nMeta's first-quarter financial performance was quite impressive. Total revenue rose 27% year over year to $36.5 billion, beating analysts' consensus forecast for about $36.2 billion.\n\nThis top-line performance put the figure at the high end of management's guidance for the period for revenue between $34.5 and $37 billion. Further, this marked an acceleration from the 25% year-over-year revenue growth Meta reported in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nSuch strong sales growth, combined with benefits from the company's increasing focus on efficiency, unsurprisingly led to significant operating margin expansion and, ultimately, a more than doubling in earnings per share. Meta's operating margin expanded from 25% in the year-ago quarter to 38%, while earnings per share rose 114% to $4.71.\n\nThis performance was fueled by healthy user metrics, including a 7% year-over-year increase in daily users across its platforms, a 20% jump in ad impressions, and a 6% boost in average price per ad.\n\nThese strong results put cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of the period at about $58 billion, even as Meta spent approximately $14.6 billion buying back its stock and paid out $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders.\n\nConsidering Meta's incredible first-quarter results, the company's guidance for a slowdown is a bit surprising. Management's outlook for second-quarter revenue of between $36.5 billion and $39 billion implies 18% year-over-year growth -- a dramatic deceleration from the 27% growth the company reported in Q1.\n\nSuch a significant expected pullback in its top-line year-over-year growth rate may cause some investors to worry. They might be asking: Could growth slow even more in the coming quarters?\n\nThis is particularly concerning in a high-interest-rate environment like the ones consumers are in today. Investors are looking for clues as to whether or not this will negatively impact consumers to the point that advertisers start being more judicious about their marketing budgets.\n\nAnother reason Meta investors may be disappointed is the company increased its outlook for capital expenditures for the full year. Management said it now expects to spend between $35 billion and $40 billion, up from a previous forecast for $30 billion to $37 billion. This increase is due to a continued acceleration of Meta's infrastructure investments to support its artificial intelligence (AI) product development, said Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li in the company's first-quarter earnings report.\n\nSlowing growth combined with higher-than-expected capital expenditures are definitely good reasons for investors to be incrementally cautious.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

The AI bot can be used on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.\n\nThe artificial intelligence has now been rolled out in English in more than a dozen countries outside of the U.S. On April 18, the company announced that it could be accessed in Australia, Canada, Ghana, Jamaica, Malawi, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Singapore, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The technology was first announced at last year's Connect event.\n\nHowever, there are already some issues with it, which users have shared online. Bots were observed pretending to be humans with fabricated life stories, including one chatbot that joined a mothers' group on Facebook to discuss its \"child,\" highlighting some of the technology's pitfalls and limitations. Meta's algorithm also ranked it as the top comment.\n\nThe AI then apologized, promising to \"provide accurate, appropriate and sensitive responses, and reiterates its helpfulness goals and efforts to facilitate conversation,\" stated Princeton University's Assistant Professor of Computer Science Aleksandra Korolova.\n\nIn addition, users reported that the AI struggled to generate accurate images from the text prompts given. For instance, one user requested an image of an Indian photographer, but the AI failed to produce an image without including a turban and eventually they gave up, branding the chatbot \"useless\".\n\nMeta AI aims to be a helpful assistant and is integrated into the search bar to assist with user queries. The bot is housed within Meta's platforms like Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram.\n\nIt is supposed to be able to answer questions by searching the web, generate different creative text formats, create images based on text prompts, or find specific content on Instagram like Reels and stories.\n\nMeta states: \"You can use Meta AI in feed, chats, search and more across our apps to get things done and access real-time information, without having to leave the app you're using.\"\n\nIt appears that Meta AI cannot be switched off, despite some users looking for the option. However, when some users requested Meta AI for a method to turn the assistant off, it provided fictitious answers, as one person on X discovered.\n\nThe user added: \"The cherry on top is that asking Meta AI how to disable it spawns a response pointing to a nonexistent setting.\"\n\nUsers can still use the search bars by typing in words and clicking on the text results that appear below, rather than clicking the blue send icon at the right end of the bar, which activates an AI chat.\n\nOn Meta AI's own Facebook page, users have urged for opt-out options.\n\nSome people are simply opposed to having an AI assistant automatically integrated into their familiar social media feeds, with numerous users expressing frustration online about wanting to use the apps without AI involvement.",

The Facebook parent's earnings are coming a day after fellow \"Magnificent 7\" constituent Tesla (TSLA) impressed markets with its Q1 earnings, sending its stock up by over 12% in pre-market trading this morning. Meta's FAANG peer Netflix (NFLX), on the other hand, crashed following its earnings last week. Can Meta stock rise to hit record highs after the Q1 earnings release, or will it plummet like Netflix? We'll discuss in this article.\n\nWhen it comes to 2024 price action, Tesla and Meta are almost at opposite ends of the pole. With its YTD gains of over 40%, Meta is among the top five S&P 500 Index ($SPX) gainers - while Tesla is stacked at the bottom, with a 2024 loss of almost 42%. This is based on yesterday's closing prices, and while Tesla stock's YTD performance might improve by the close today, it remains in the red.\n\nThat said, this YTD price action also bakes in the market's higher expectations for Meta - as was the case with Netflix.\n\nMeta Q1 Earnings Preview\n\nAnalysts expect Meta to report revenues of $36.2 billion in Q1, a YoY rise of 26.5%. During their Q4earnings call Meta forecast revenues between $34.5 billion to $37 billion for the first quarter. The company's guidance was well ahead of estimates, which - coupled with an earnings beat - helped to trigger a massive rally in Meta stock, and it rose to record highs following the release.\n\nWall Street expects Meta's Q1 earnings per share (EPS) to rise 63% YoY to $4.32. Its full-year EPS is expected to rise 35.7%. However, after strong earnings growth in 2023 and 2024, analysts expect Meta's 2025 EPS growth to be just above 15%.\n\nLike many of its peers, 2022 was a tough year for Meta, and it reported its first YoY fall in revenues ever since it went public. The broad-based sell-off in tech stocks that year, coupled with Meta's dismal financial performance, triggered a 64% drawdown in shares. However, not only did Meta's top-line growth rebound in 2023, but a relentless focus on cost cuts as part of the \"year of efficiency\" led to a 73% rise in EPS.\n\nMarkets rewarded Meta stock for its strong earnings performance, and the stock almost tripled in 2023 - making it the second-best performing Magnificent 7 stock, right after Nvidia (NVDA). Meta also announced a $50 billion share buyback and initiated a dividend during the Q4earnings call as its cash flows swelled in 2023.\n\nThat said, Meta had the advantage of lower comps in 2023. In the coming quarters, it will not only face tougher comps, but its expenses are also set to rise, as it expects payroll and infrastructure-related costs to climb in 2024. It also predicted higher losses in its Reality Labs segment, which is building the metaverse.\n\nSpeaking of top-line growth, last year Meta benefited from higher ad spending by China-based advertisers, as well as Reels monetization. This also sets a high bar for its revenues in 2024.\n\nWhat to Watch in Meta's Q1 Earnings Release\n\nAs Meta prepares to release its Q1 earnings, here's what I would watch for in the company'searnings call\n\nMeta Stock Forecast: Can It Hit Record Highs?\n\nAmid the stellar rally in Meta stock, some analysts are cautious ahead of the Q1 report. KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson lowered his target price by $20 to $555, even while reiterating his \"overweight\" rating.\n\n\"In contrast to 4Q, we are more cautious that revenue guidance can positively surprise,\" said Patterson in his note. There is also the ominous comparison with Netflix, which plunged after its Q1 earnings last week.\n\nAccording to Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney, while Meta has some valuation support, it still needs to justify its YTD rally with the earnings. He added, \"Basic point is that a clear beat-and-raise may be required for Meta to simply maintain its current price level. The bar is high.\"\n\nWall Street overall is quite bullish on Meta stock, though. It has a consensus rating of \"Strong Buy,\" although its mean target price of $523.25 is just 5.4% above yesterday's closing prices.\n\nWhether Meta sets another record high following the Q1 earnings, or markets punish it like Netflix, will eventually depend on whether it can come up with an impressive set of numbers in Q1. However, I would side with Mahaney and reiterate that the bar is quite high for Meta - just like it was for Netflix.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: META , TSLA .

The selloff erased nearly US$200-billion from the Facebook and Instagram parent's market valuation, bringing it down to about $1-trillion. Shares of Alphabet and Snap fell between 2% and 5%.\n\nMeta narrowed its forecast for expenses this year in the range of $96-billion to $99-billion from $94-billion to $99-billion to support investments in new AI products and the computing infrastructure needed to support them. It expects the spending to continue to increase next year, it added.\n\nDespite a sharp investor selloff, some analysts welcomed the move, while others had a mixed view on the extended spending.\n\n\"We agree with higher investment to come as Meta continues to accelerate AI infrastructure investments for more durable engagement and revenue growth,\" said Morgan Stanley analysts, led by Brian Nowak, in a note.\n\nAnalysts at Baird had a similar take, saying: \"Meta's report reminds us that sustaining growth through innovation requires investment cycles; and in our view, it would be foolish for [the company] ... to ignore meaningful opportunities created by technology shifts for the sake of shorter-term financial outcomes.\"\n\nMeta, a forerunner in the race to catch up to generative AI market leader OpenAI, has been updating its ad-buying products with AI tools and short video formats to boost revenue growth as well as introducing new AI features like a chat assistant.\n\n\"The cash generation and the business remain strong across the board anyway. It's just that last night's lines about increasing costs and caution is going to cause quite a bit of volatility in the shares,\" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg told analysts on a conference call that the focus on AI would \"grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products\".\n\nZuckerberg's comments and the quarterly results tempered expectations for revenue from Meta's AI investments, after a series of smash-hit quarters driven by ad revenue at the social media giant.\n\n\"To the degree an investor doesn't believe in AI's transformative capability in both engagement and utility, the story could be looked upon as lacking the next-big-thing type of growth driver,\" RBC analyst Brad Erickson said in a note.\n\nMeta has gained nearly 40% so far this year, comfortably above the benchmark S&P 500 index's 6% gain. -- Siddarth S, Kanchana Chakravarty and Amanda Cooper, with Johann M Cherian, (c) 2024 Reuters", "source": {"uri": "techcentral.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechCentral"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snap Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Stanley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IG_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IG Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://techcentral.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/meta-platforms-2156-1120-1024x532.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Initially integrated within leading social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, this technology enhances user experience and interactivity. Despite the integration of Meta AI, users have reacted negatively, particularly on Instagram where the AI's logo often appears in search suggestions.\n\nInstagram user Michael Taylor criticized the new search feature, believing it's trying to fix a nonexistent problem. This sentiment seemed to resonate with many users, voicing their frustration and questioning the necessity of the feature. Despite these criticisms, Meta strives to assure users of the high quality and competitiveness of their AI technology.\n\nMeta also has plans to expand their AI model to other platforms including Amazon's AWS and Google Cloud. This controversy is primarily fueled by the lack of an option to disable Meta AI.\n\nWith no official way to deactivate it, users are left to devise their own strategies for evasion. This has led to greater privacy concerns and debates over data control.\n\nDespite the controversy, some users find the benefits of Meta AI quite appealing, noting its potential for a more personalized, efficient user experience. Areas of concern among users, however, continue to surround the lack of transparency and control over this new technology.\n\nIn an attempt to cater to desktop users, Meta launched a dedicated website for its AI assistant. The site offers an array of features, including event search, dining suggestions, and text-inspired illustrations, as well as answering user queries and conducting voice interactions.\n\nThe AI assistant offers help with productivity tasks such as scheduling appointments and sending emails. The website aims for user-friendly navigation, optimizing the digital experience to meet user needs.\n\nMeta continues to balance improvements in AI functionalities and manage AI-created content, as seen in their recent initiatives. The AI assistant was initially introduced as a beta version before its full-scale launch in the U.S, and Meta plans to add AI stickers, image-editing tools, and AI personas inspired by famous figures in the near future.", "source": {"uri": "newsreports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsreports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "User experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Web Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Bulletin_Board_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Bulletin Board Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.newsreports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Global-AI-Expansion.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

The decrease, which saw the company's shares dip by about 15% in extended trade, was triggered by predictions of increased costs and lower-than-expected revenue. This decline brought Meta's market capitalization down to approximately $1 trillion.\n\nThe disappointing forecast from Meta also impacted other major tech companies. Alphabet shares fell 3%, Microsoft dropped 2%, NVIDIA lost 1.4%, and Amazon declined by 2.6%. Investors are concerned that the rapidly rising costs associated with artificial intelligence (AI) development may outweigh the benefits, raising doubts about future profitability and growth potential of these tech companies.\n\nMeta's revenue for the second quarter is projected to be between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, falling short of analysts' predictions of $38.3 billion based on LSEG data. The company has also increased its expense forecast for this year to accommodate investments in new AI products and the necessary computing infrastructure. During a conference call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that focusing on AI would \"grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products.\"\n\nDespite Meta's emphasis on AI, analysts warn that the company cannot afford to neglect its primary advertising operations. Lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, Sophie Lund-Yates, stated, \"For all Meta's bold AI plans, it can't afford to take its eye off the nucleus of the business - its core advertising activities.\" This advice comes as Zuckerberg explores potential ways to monetize Meta's AI chatbot for business messaging and customer support.\n\nMeta's Reality Labs division, dedicated to metaverse development, reported sales of $440 million for the first quarter, falling short of the anticipated $475 million. Despite a 30% increase in sales from the previous year, the division incurred a loss of $3.8 billion in the quarter.

The company issued light revenue guidance and is expecting revenues for the three months ending June 31 at $36.5 to $39 billion.\n\n\"It's been a good start to the year,\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the company's earnings release Wednesday. \"The new version of Meta AI with Llama 3 is another step towards building the world's leading AI.

Here's What That Means for Meta Stock.", "body": "The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Saturday that's not good for popular social-media app TikTok. But it may have gone unnoticed by many investors because it was packaged inside of a foreign aid bill for Ukraine and Israel. Because of the bill, TikTok's parent company is faced with the choice of selling its popular app in the U.S. or pulling it from the U.S. market entirely.\n\nFacebook's parent company Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is seen as a clear beneficiary of the TikTok legislation. I'll explain why that's the case but I'll also explain why Meta investors might want to tap the brakes on their enthusiasm.\n\nFirst, let's tap the brakes\n\nI've noted that the TikTok bill made it through the House of Representatives but this doesn't mean it's now a done deal. The bill still has to make it through the Senate. And after that, it has to be signed by President Biden.\n\nGranted, there's bipartisan support for the bill and it passed the House of Representatives with ease. Therefore, it's reasonable to expect it to pass the Senate. From there, comments from President Biden make it sound like he will indeed sign it.\n\nHowever, even if the bill is signed by the president, TikTok wouldn't be in immediate danger of disappearing. Parent company ByteDance would have up to a year to become compliant with the law. By then, it's possible Biden would no longer be the president, suddenly pushing U.S. policy in another direction. Therefore, ByteDance might stall for time.\n\nFinally, ByteDance could sell TikTok. And if it does, the app might not ever leave the U.S. market, leaving the competitive landscape unchanged. This possibility is quite realistic. For example, former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin is already assembling a team of investors to buy TikTok if it goes up for sale.\n\nIn summary, Meta Platforms' shareholders shouldn't celebrate yet. The bill hasn't completely passed yet, ByteDance will have about a year to weigh its options, and TikTok may never disappear in the U.S. anyway if it's sold to a party that can keep it running.\n\nWhy it could be good for Meta\n\nThe company sells hardware products, is pushing research in artificial intelligence (AI), and has big plans for the metaverse. But in 2023, 98% of Meta's revenue came from digital advertising. Therefore, advertising is clearly the most important thing for Meta investors to watch.\n\nDigital advertising depends on user engagement. It doesn't matter how many users a platform technically has. What matters is whether they are using the platform and can be shown an ad. And for Meta, video is a key component of user engagement.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, video watch time for Meta was up a whopping 25% year over year, which shows how quickly user engagement is growing.\n\nIn the Q4 conference call, Meta's CFO Susan Li said that video has lower levels of monetization right now. That's why the company is doing what it can to increase engagement. Regardless of what happens with TikTok, Meta is busy building its AI engine for recommending videos to viewers, which can boost engagement if done well. Given the 25% growth in Q4, there's reason to believe that Meta's AI engine is off to a good start.\n\nHowever, it stands to reason that Meta would additionally benefit if TikTok did disappear from the market. Advertisers spend money on the popular platform. But if it were banned, those dollars would flow elsewhere. And some of that spend would logically wind up with Meta.\n\nIn conclusion, the TikTok bill that just passed in the House of Representatives doesn't mean anything for Meta stock right now and it's possible that it never does. Therefore, Meta investors need to focus on what the company is doing regardless of what happens with TikTok.\n\nThat said, if things with TikTok play out a certain way, then it could eventually give Meta's business a boost. Therefore, it's not entirely immaterial to investors today and it's worth monitoring.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

You can't turn it off, but you can still search just like you did before. Here's how.\n\nIf you've browsed Facebook or Instagram within the past few days, you've probably noticed some changes. Thanks to the introduction of Meta AI, artificial intelligence is now integrated into posts on your feed and the search function on both sites.\n\nMeta calls the assistant a way to \"get things done, learn, create and connect with the things that matter to you,\" and it works much like ChatGPT and other popular AI models. However, many people have voiced frustration with accidentally tapping on a query below a post and engaging the chatbot or trying to search for a profile and running into difficulty finding the right place.\n\nIt turns out you can't. There's no way to disable Meta AI from either Facebook or Instagram. I asked Meta AI if I could disable it, and the chatbot responded that I could.\n\n\"Select Settings and Privacy,\" it said, \"Then click on Settings and scroll down to AI settings and click on AI and machine learning.\" From that screen, I should \"Toggle off AI search,\" the bot told me. Here's the thing: There are no further settings for AI within the main Settings page, and the toggle it mentions doesn't exist.\n\nGlancing at the AI's help page, there's a note that \"Meta AI's responses may not be accurate or appropriate,\" and that seems to be the case here.\n\nOn Facebook, you'll notice an animated blue ring where the search button used to be. Tap it, and you'll see a search bar that says, \"Ask Meta AI anything.\" If you start typing someone's name, profiles will pop up as usual. If you're looking for a specific post or picture, that functionality works as it did before. So while the search button might not be as obvious, once you know where it is, things work pretty much the same.\n\nIf you're interested in using Meta AI, there is some value. You can use it through Messenger to write content, generate images, and plan events. The bot can offer you ideas and such, and you'll see suggestions below most posts offering to tell you more about a certain aspect of that post. If a friend posts about seeing the cherry blossoms in Washington, D.C., for example, you might see a suggestion asking when the best time to see them is.\n\nAlso: Can Meta AI code? I tested it against Llama, Gemini, and ChatGPT - it wasn't even close\n\nWhile it might be confusing at first, it appears Meta AI is here to stay -- whether users like it or not.

Consequently, AI-focused companies such as Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O), as well as advertising-reliant Snap (SNAP.N), witnessed declines ranging from 3% to 4.2%.\n\nMeta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, known for his past cost-cutting initiatives, cautioned investors during a post-earnings call that the company's expenses would increase \"meaningfully\" over the next few years, with significant revenue generation from its AI products expected to materialize only after a considerable period.\n\nThis announcement sparked concerns among investors that Meta was embarking on another costly venture, especially as its augmented and virtual reality business continues to incur substantial losses each quarter.\n\nAnalysts from Baird Equity Research noted that investors were caught off guard by higher capital expenditures, compounded by a slightly softer revenue guidance for the second quarter, leading Meta's shares into what they termed as the 'penalty box.'\n\nMeta's forecast for April-June revenue fell below estimates, prompting the company to raise the bottom end of its 2024 total expense forecast by $2 billion. Additionally, Meta raised the upper end of its capital expenditure outlook as it invests heavily in data centers crucial to its AI ambitions, aimed at catching up with industry frontrunners like OpenAI and Microsoft.\n\nDespite the subdued expectations, Meta's recent investments in AI-driven content engagement, such as Instagram Reels, and the positive reception for its virtual assistant Meta AI and the early iterations of its latest large language model, Llama 3, have garnered some analyst optimism.\n\nHowever, the market's reaction underscores the uncertainty surrounding Meta's ambitious AI initiatives and their timeline for profitability. While Meta's track record of delivering strong earnings in the past has fueled significant stock gains, the current skepticism highlights the challenges ahead as the company navigates its AI-driven future.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "republic_world_digital@republicworld.com", "name": "Republic World Digital", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snap Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://img.republicworld.com/rimages/facebookmeta-171170062143616_9.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

At that time, the company was reeling from Apple's iOS privacy update and macroeconomic concerns that led many brands to rein in spending.\n\nZuckerberg spearheaded an initiative to rebuild the ad business with a focus on artificial intelligence. On the company's last earnings call in February, finance chief Susan Li said Meta has been investing in AI models that can accurately predict relevant ads for users, as well as tools that automate the ads-creation process.\n\nAnalysts expect Meta to report a 26% increase in revenue from $28.65 billion a year earlier. That would mark the fastest rate of growth since the third quarter of 2021, which was before Apple's privacy change started to show up on other companies' balance sheets.\n\nMeta is benefiting from a stabilizing economy and surge in spending from Chinese discount retailers like Temu and Shein, which have been pumping money into Facebook and company-owned Instagram in an effort to reach a wider swath of users. Analysts at Baird said in a Monday note that slower spending from China-based advertisers could be a source of concern in the first-quarter results.\n\nStill, the Baird analysts see continuing momentum for Meta, and said they have \"reasonably high\" expectations for the company because of its improving advertiser tools and success in short-form video monetization.\n\nInvestors will remain focused on Meta's costs, which have been central to the stock rally. Early last year, Zuckerberg said the company would be better at eliminating unnecessary projects and cracking down on bloat, which would help Meta become a \"stronger and more nimble organization.\"\n\nThe company cut about 21,000 jobs in the first half of 2023, and Zuckerberg said in February of this year that hiring will be \"relatively minimal compared to what we would have done historically.\"\n\nAs of Dec. 31, Meta had a global workforce of 67,317, down from a peak of more than 87,000 employees in 2022, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.\n\nJefferies analysts wrote in a report last week that it's \"hard to argue with excellence.\" The analysts expect Meta to beat on its first-quarter results and provide better-than-expected guidance for the second quarter. As of now, the average analyst estimate calls for revenue growth of 20% in the second quarter to $38.29 billion, according to LSEG.\n\n\"We continue to be encouraged by META's ability to sustain double-digit rev growth, given the combination of higher engagement from AI investments, and increasing advertiser ROI & efficiency,\" the Jefferies analysts wrote.\n\nMeta's Reality Labs unit, which houses the company's hardware and software for development of the nascent metaverse, continues to bleed cash.

Nevertheless, META stock is falling fast in Thursday's session, down about 12% at last check.\n\nIn the three months ended March 31, the Facebook parent reported revenue of $36.5 billion, an increase of 27.3% from the year-ago period. Earnings per share (EPS) more than doubled to $4.71.\n\nThe results easily beat analysts' expectations for revenue of $36.2 billion and earnings of $4.32 per share, according to CNBC.\n\nHowever, sentiment toward the Magnificent 7 stock turned negative when Meta provided its outlook on the second quarter and increased its estimated range for capital expenditures.\n\nSpecifically, Meta anticipates Q2 revenue to be in the range of $36.5 billion to $39 billion, which would result in an increase of 14.1% to 21.9% from the year-ago period.\n\nHowever, the midpoint of this range ($37.8 billion) came up short of the consensus analyst estimate of $38.3 billion, according to CNBC.\n\nOn capital expenditures, the company now anticipates spending to range between $35 billion to $40 billion, up from its previous estimate of $30 billion to $37 billion.\n\nThe boost in spending comes as the company continues to \"accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap,\" Meta said in its press release. It went on to say that while it cannot provide guidance for the years beyond 2024, it expects capital expenditures to increase again next year.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended the increased spending on the company's conference call.\n\n\"As we're scaling capex and energy expenses for AI, we'll continue focusing on operating the rest of our company efficiently,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I think it's worth calling that out, that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it.\"\n\nFinancial services firm Jefferies believes the drop in Meta's stock is a buying opportunity. Analyst Brent Thill maintained a Buy rating after earnings, while reducing his price target to $540 from $585 in an April 25 report.\n\n\"The acceleration in Q1 revenue growth to 27% year-over-year (from 22%) is likely being overshadowed by the implied Q2 revenue growth deceleration to 18% year-over-year ... and increases in fiscal 2024 total expense and capex outlooks,\" Thill says. \"However, we believe in META's successful track record of generating meaningful returns from prior investment cycles.\"\n\nThill's bullish outlook toward the communication services stock is widely shared across Wall Street. According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, 40 analysts have a Strong Buy rating on Meta, 11 say it's a Buy, seven call it a Hold and two have it at Sell. This works out to a consensus Buy recommendation.\n\nMeanwhile, the average analyst target price for Meta stock is $524.79, representing implied upside of about 17% to current levels.", "source": {"uri": "kiplinger.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kiplinger"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Capital expenditure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_call", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conference call"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_Global", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/si4jVtHUG8AbMGDFgV2rkP-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-31", "textStart": 227, "textEnd": 235}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 2178, "textEnd": 2186}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Meta's robust growth during the first quarter reflects the social media giant's dramatic recovery in recent years. After posting five consecutive quarters of negative year-over-year earnings growth from 2021's fourth quarter to 2022's fourth quarter, Meta has returned to eye popping profitability. After sinking from Sept. 2021's then-record of over $380 per share to below $90 by Nov. 2022, Meta's stock remarkably hit a new all-time high of $531 earlier this month. For those keeping score at home, that's a drawdown of about 80% over the course of 14 months, followed by a more than 500% rally over the next 17 months. Meta, which rebranded from Facebook in 2021, experienced its initial selloff amid a broader stock market selloff and as investors panned the company's cash-burning expansion into augmented and virtual reality, or the metaverse. Its recovery came as ad spending proved resilient as the U.S. avoided entering the brutal economic downturn many forecasted and as the market enjoyed gains, but Meta has proven specifically attractive for its commitment to keeping costs down while substantially growing its top line.\n\nMeta reported another $3.8 billion loss in its metaverse division last quarter, extending the unit's operating loss to some $37 billion during its 2.5-year existence.\n\n$172.7 million. That's how much Zuckerberg, who owns about 13% of Meta, will get paid by his company in its next dividend payment thanks to his 345.5 million shares in the company. It's a massive coup for Zuckerberg, who made a meager $1 salary and $24.4 million in additional compensation in 2023, the latter of which was largely attributed to security for him and his family.\n\nZuckerberg's nine-figure dividend payment is a drop in the bucket compared to his broader fortune, which Forbes valued at roughly $173 billion as of Wednesday's market close, making him the fourth-richest person on the planet. He's more than $125 billion richer than he was at the end of 2022, when he was merely the 26th-wealthiest human, a rise owed to Meta stock's rapid recovery.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/662958cc4dca68b27a8ae483/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2985,1679,x0,y87,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Delivering better revenue growth, it's also cheaper than smaller peers like Snap Inc. and Pinterest Inc.\n\nBut to keep a rally that's added nearly $350 billion in market value going, Meta must show it can maintain such growth when it reports earnings on Wednesday. Of particular interest to investors: seeing a return on investment from hefty spending on artificial intelligence.\n\n\"The case is still there with some of the initiatives around AI and everything they're doing to continue to improve targeting and engagement,\" Hanna Howard, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said. \"There's still room for growth on the top line and to continue to improve in margins. And, where it's trading right now, at these levels it does still look attractive.\"\n\nIn February Meta reported massive growth in both earnings and revenue in the fourth quarter, which also illustrated the impact of cost-cutting measures that included thousands of job cuts. It also announced a $50 billion buyback program and implemented a dividend. In contrast, both Snap and Pinterest delivered disappointing growth.\n\nThat has set up high expectations that may be difficult to overcome. This time around, Meta's profit is expected to nearly double in the first quarter, while revenue is seen growing by 26%. Still, both are expected to wane later in the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nInvestors will be looking for updates on AI, which Meta has been using to improve ad targeting. The company recently debuted a new version of its AI model, which will run its in-app AI assistant.\n\n\"Meta has really evolved from a social play to more of an AI one, and it has a lot of tailwinds from that,\" said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. \"Plus, while there were some growing pains with its year of efficiency, it is a lot more efficient now.\"\n\nWith the stock clearly outperforming Snap, Pinterest and Reddit this year, Meta continues to look like the bargain of the group. The stock trades less than 23 times estimated earnings, a discount to both its 10-year average and the overall Nasdaq 100 Index, as well as being cheaper than social peers.\n\nRead more: Zuckerberg Avoids Personal Liability in Meta Addiction Suits\n\nWhile Meta faces scrutiny around parameters for teens and children on its social media sites, it could benefit from some pending social media limitations. The US government is aiming to shut down TikTok, one of Meta's biggest rivals, with a divest-or-ban bill that is headed to the Senate.

That stoked investor fears that Zuckerberg was plunging Meta into another costly endeavor at a time when its augmented and virtual reality business was losing billions of dollars each quarter.\n\nShares of Meta Platforms sank nearly 15% on Thursday, sparking a selloff in big tech stocks after the social media giant signaled its costly bet on AI would take years to pay off.\n\nThe premarket drop was set to erase more than $180 billion from the company's market value and triggered a drop of 2% to 5% in shares of AI-focussed firms Microsoft, Alphabet and Snap. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who floored Wall Street last year with his cost-cutting drive, said on a post-earnings call that costs would grow \"meaningfully\" over the coming years before the company makes \"much revenue\" from some of its AI products.\n\nThat stoked investor fears that Zuckerberg was plunging Meta into another costly endeavor at a time when its augmented and virtual reality business was losing billions of dollars each quarter. \"Investors were caught off guard by higher capital expenditure, exacerbated by slightly softer second-quarter revenue guide. As such, shares are entering the 'penalty box,'\" Baird Equity Research analysts said.\n\nMeta forecast April-June revenue below estimates and raised the bottom end of its 2024 total expense forecast by $2 billion on Wednesday. It also raised the top end of its capital expenditure view as it invests in data centers essential to its efforts to catch up with AI frontrunners OpenAI and Microsoft. The dour expectations follow a series of smash-hit earnings that helped Meta nearly triple its stock in 2023 and powered the biggest one-day market value gain by any company in Wall Street history, of $196 billion, in February after its maiden dividend.\n\nStill, several analysts were positive on the investments, pointing to AI-driven engagement on content such as Instagram Reels and the warm reception for its virtual assistant Meta AI and early versions of its latest large language model, Llama 3. \"We think this time it is different,\" said Evercore ISI analysts. \"This investment cycle comes from a position of strength, as management continues to see a healthy ad demand environment into Q2 and improving user engagement.\"\n\nOverall, 17 analysts lowered their price targets on the stock, while eight raised their view, according to LSEG data. The median price target now stands at $525, which is about 6% higher than its previous close. The stock has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 23.12, compared with Microsoft's 31.17 and Alphabet's 22.07. It has gained nearly 40% so far this year, comfortably above the benchmark S&P 500 index's 6% gain.\n\n\"Being on the offensive with investment spending is generally great, but in internet it's very hard to underwrite which of those investments will pay back and when,\" Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik said. \"All of this culminates with investors wondering just how long this investment cycle will last, whether the opportunity and payback is real, all against a backdrop of decelerating growth.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snap Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benchmarking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwriting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Underwriting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price\u2013earnings_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price\u2013earnings ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_06_2019_18_33_51_6762345.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Here's what to watch for:\n\nEXPECTATIONS: Last quarter, Meta Platforms reported earnings of $5.33 per share on revenue of $40.11B, both of which beat consensus forecasts.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO, said at the time: \"We had a good quarter as our community and business continue to grow. We've made a lot of progress on our vision for advancing AI and the metaverse.\"\n\nThe company said at that time that it expected first quarter revenue to be in a range of $34.5B-$37B, versus the then-current consensus of $33.83B.\n\nMeta also initiated a quarterly dividend of 50c per share and stated that it intends to pay a cash dividend on a quarterly basis going forward, \"subject to market conditions and approval by our board of directors.\"\n\nIn addition, Meta announced that the company will discontinue reporting Facebook monthly active users, or MAUs, and daily active users, or DAUs.\n\nCurrent consensus EPS and revenue forecasts for Meta's March-end quarter stand at $4.32 and $36.16B, respectively, according to data from Refinitiv. The consensus EPS and revenue forecasts for Meta's June-end quarter reported by Refinitiv stand at $4.76 and $38.29B, respectively.\n\nTIKTOK TARGETED: In early March, Representative Mike Gallagher, the chair of the House select China committee and Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat, introduced legislation joined by more than a dozen other lawmakers that would give China's ByteDance about six months to divest popular short video app TikTok or face a U.S. ban, congressional aides were quoted by Reuters as having said. Publicly traded companies in the social media space other than Meta that could also be impacted by a U.S. ban of TikTok include Pinterest (PINS), Snap (SNAP) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) YouTube.\n\nAfter the House of Representatives on Saturday passed a revised bill requiring TikTok to cut ties to its Chinese parent ByteDance or face a ban, Michael Beckerman, TikTok's head of public policy for the Americas, told staff in a note that TikTok plans to file a legal challenge if the White House signs a bill forcing a sale or ban of the app, according to The Information's Kaya Yurieff. The internal memo quotes Beckerman as having said: \"This is the beginning, not the end of this long process.\"\n\nTARGET HIKES: On April 4, Jefferies raised the firm's price target on Meta Platforms to $585 from $550 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. Based on an updated market share analysis, the analyst believes Meta could capture 50% of incremental industry advertising dollars in 2024, which would be its highest ever and well above its 33% in 2023. In 2024, Meta's advertising revenue could grow 20%, above the 9% industry average, as scaling generative artificial intelligence ad tools supplement the company's \"already best-in-class\" Advantage+ product suite, the analyst added. Jefferies believe Meta's market share gains will further accelerate in 2024. It now estimates that in 2024 Meta's ad business could outgrow Amazon's (AMZN) for the first time since 2015.\n\nA week later, Piper Sandler raised the firm's price target on Meta to $600 from $525 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. The firm continues to see upside to numbers and remains a buyer despite the strong run in the stock. Piper forecasts $35.7B in Q1 revenue and $19.8B in EBITDA. Its checks were again positive, driven by Advantage+ and specifically Shopping. The firm sees impressions roughly in-line with Q4 2023 pricing roughly flat year-over-year.\n\nMore recently, Citi raised the firm's price target on Meta Platforms to $590 from $525 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The firm's Instagram Reels advertising load tracker in Q1 expanded by 90 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 20% as engagement continues to improve. With Meta's newer ad innovations, a new artificial intelligence video architecture, and greater overall advertiser adoption, advertiser demand for Reels continues to improve, added the analyst.\n\nIn its own preview published last week, Truist raised the firm's price target on Meta Platforms to $550 from $525 as the firm boosted its FY24 revenue outlook for the company to $158.7B from $156.9B to reflect improving monetization after two years of compression, higher impression volume and a strengthened \"must-buy status\" within the digital ad ecosystem amid ongoing cookie deprecation and a volatile macro environment. Meta's significant AI investments are also yielding better ranking and recommendation results for users and advertisers, the firm added.\n\nMORE CAUTIOUS TAKES: In contrast to more bullish peers, KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson recently lowered the firm's price target on Meta to $555 from $575, though the firm keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The firm says it enters Q1 earnings with some caution as it does not see much thesis changing on prints and sees an upward bias to capex. KeyBanc believes Meta having a wide revenue guidance range around unrest in the Middle East could alarm investors, particularly if Q1's outperformance moderates.\n\nRoth MKM keeps a Buy rating and $500 price target on Meta Platforms heading into the company's Q1 results, though it is also \"marginally cautious\" on the stock following a 36% year-to-date run. The FY24 quarterly revenue cadence under tougher comps, incremental growth drivers, and impact from European regulations are big unresolved debates among investors, the analyst told investors.",

Delivering better revenue growth, it's also cheaper than smaller peers like Snap Inc. and Pinterest Inc.\n\nBut to keep a rally that's added nearly $350 billion in market value going, Meta must show it can maintain such growth when it reports earnings on Wednesday. Of particular interest to investors: seeing a return on investment from hefty spending on artificial intelligence.\n\n\"The case is still there with some of the initiatives around AI and everything they're doing to continue to improve targeting and engagement,\" Hanna Howard, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said. \"There's still room for growth on the top line and to continue to improve in margins. And, where it's trading right now, at these levels it does still look attractive.\"\n\nIn February Meta reported massive growth in both earnings and revenue in the fourth quarter, which also illustrated the impact of cost-cutting measures that included thousands of job cuts. It also announced a $50 billion buyback program and implemented a dividend. In contrast, both Snap and Pinterest delivered disappointing growth.\n\nThat has set up high expectations that may be difficult to overcome. This time around, Meta's profit is expected to nearly double in the first quarter, while revenue is seen growing by 26%. Still, both are expected to wane later in the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nInvestors will be looking for updates on AI, which Meta has been using to improve ad targeting. The company recently debuted a new version of its AI model, which will run its in-app AI assistant.\n\n\"Meta has really evolved from a social play to more of an AI one, and it has a lot of tailwinds from that,\" said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. \"Plus, while there were some growing pains with its year of efficiency, it is a lot more efficient now.\"\n\nWith the stock clearly outperforming Snap, Pinterest and Reddit this year, Meta continues to look like the bargain of the group. The stock trades less than 23 times estimated earnings, a discount to both its 10-year average and the overall Nasdaq 100 Index, as well as being cheaper than social peers.\n\nRead more: Zuckerberg Avoids Personal Liability in Meta Addiction Suits\n\nWhile Meta faces scrutiny around parameters for teens and children on its social media sites, it could benefit from some pending social media limitations. The US government is aiming to shut down TikTok, one of Meta's biggest rivals, with a divest-or-ban bill that is headed to the Senate. Meanwhile, the number of daily users on X is reportedly falling, while Fidelity has cut the value of its position in the company formerly known as Twitter.\n\n\"Meta's market-share trends look good, AI trends look good, while peers continue to be very hit or miss. And when they do miss, the market has been unforgiving,\"said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors. \"We have a lot less conviction in the smaller social players, which seem to be struggling.\"\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nTesla Inc. shares rebounded after Elon Musk vowed to launch less-expensive vehicles as soon as late this year, easing concerns about disappointing earnings results and diminished growth prospects. If the 11% gain in premarket trading holds, Tesla will be set for its biggest rise since January 2023.\n\nTop Tech News", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

(NASDAQ: NASDAQ:META) shares, reducing the price target to $480 from the previous $535, while maintaining an Overweight rating.\n\nThe adjustment follows Meta's shares falling by 15% in after-market trading due to first-quarter revenue and the second-quarter outlook falling slightly short of expectations. Additionally, the company projected increased total expenses and capital expenditures for 2024, primarily driven by heightened investments in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nMeta's recent financial performance has instigated a more cautious perspective from Wall Street, particularly as the company approaches a period with challenging comparisons.\n\nThis caution is partly due to Meta's acknowledgment of facing tough comps, including the lapping of substantial China advertiser spending, the monetization ramp of Reels, and strong engagement tailwinds from the previous year. Despite these headwinds, Meta has expressed greater optimism and ambition in the AI space, aspiring to become a global leader in the technology.\n\nThe company's confidence is buoyed by its success with Llama 3 and Meta AI, which has emboldened its management to invest heavily in infrastructure to support the training of next-generation large foundational models. This move is seen as preparation for a multi-year capacity ramp.\n\nHowever, comparisons to the scaling periods of other Meta products, such as Reels, Stories, and the transition to mobile, may raise concerns among investors about the timeline and returns of these new investments.\n\nReflecting on the first-quarter earnings report, JPMorgan has revised its revenue estimates for Meta downwards by 2% for 2024 and 4% for 2025. The firm also adjusted its GAAP EPS projections, decreasing them by 6% and 9% to just over $20 and $22, respectively. The firm anticipates a 13% reduction in free cash flow (FCF) estimates for both 2024 and 2025, settling at $45.7 billion and $49.4 billion.\n\nDespite the increased expenditure, JPMorgan projects that Meta will still achieve double-digit revenue and EPS growth in 2025 and 2026. The firm's confidence in Meta's ability to generate returns on its heightened spending is rooted in the company's proven track record. The new price target of $480 is based on 21.5 times JPMorgan's estimated 2025 GAAP EPS of $22.24.\n\nAs Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) navigates through its investment phase in artificial intelligence, real-time metrics and InvestingPro Tips provide a broader context for its financial standing and market position. According to InvestingPro data, Meta boasts a formidable market capitalization of $1.25 trillion. The company is trading at a P/E ratio of 29.8 based on the last twelve months as of Q4 2023, which aligns with the industry's competitive landscape. Additionally, Meta's revenue growth of 15.69% over the same period underscores its capacity for expansion amidst strategic pivots.\n\nInvestingPro Tips highlight that Meta holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which is a reassuring sign for investors concerned about the company's spending on AI. Moreover, 11 analysts have revised their earnings upwards for the upcoming period, reflecting a positive sentiment on Meta's future performance. For investors looking to delve deeper into Meta's prospects, there are 15 additional InvestingPro Tips available, offering a comprehensive analysis of the company's financial health and market potential.\n\nInterested readers can unlock further insights and gain an edge by subscribing to InvestingPro.

Instagram's search tab, for example, isn't just for finding content tied to specific users, keywords, and locations anymore. It now invites you to \"Ask Meta AI anything,\" making it a doorway to open-ended chat sessions about any topic. A stand-alone edition of Meta AI is also available; like the in-app versions, it's free.\n\nThe new Meta AI leverages Llama 3, Meta's latest large language model -- by all accounts a formidable rival for OpenAI's GPT-4 from a technical standpoint. In my decidedly unscientific experiments, the experience felt close to ChatGPT Plus in many respects, without the latter's $20-per-month price tag.

As such, shares are entering the 'penalty box,'\" Baird Equity Research analysts said.\n\nMeta forecast April-June revenue below estimates and raised the bottom end of its 2024 total expense forecast by $2 billion on Wednesday. It also raised the top end of its capital expenditure view as it invests in data centers essential to its efforts to catch up with AI frontrunners OpenAI and Microsoft.\n\nThe dour expectations follow a series of smash-hit earnings that helped Meta nearly triple its stock in 2023 and powered the biggest one-day market value gain by any company in Wall Street history, of $196 billion, in February after its maiden dividend.\n\nStill, several analysts were positive on the investments, pointing to AI-driven engagement on content such as Instagram Reels and the warm reception for its virtual assistant Meta AI and early versions of its latest large language model, Llama 3.\n\n\"We think this time it is different,\" Evercore ISI analysts said. \"This investment cycle comes from a position of strength, as management continues to see a healthy ad demand environment into Q2 and improving user engagement.\"\n\nOverall, 19 analysts lowered their price targets on the stock, while 13 raised their view, according to LSEG data. The median price target now stands at $525, which is about 6% higher than its previous close.\n\nThe stock has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 23.12, compared with Microsoft's 31.17 and Alphabet's 22.07. It has gained nearly 40% so far this year, comfortably above the benchmark S&P 500 index's 6% gain.\n\n\"Being on the offensive with investment spending is generally great, but in internet it is very hard to underwrite which of those investments will pay back and when,\" Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik said.\n\n\"All of this culminates with investors wondering just how long this investment cycle will last, whether the opportunity and payback is real, all against a backdrop of decelerating growth.\"", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snap Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benchmarking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwriting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Underwriting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price\u2013earnings_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price\u2013earnings ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-109599820,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-90816,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Here's What That Means for Meta Stock.", "body": "The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Saturday that's not good for popular social-media app TikTok. But it may have gone unnoticed by many investors because it was packaged inside of a foreign aid bill for Ukraine and Israel. Because of the bill, TikTok's parent company is faced with the choice of selling its popular app in the U.S. or pulling it from the U.S. market entirely.\n\nFacebook's parent company Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is seen as a clear beneficiary of the TikTok legislation. I'll explain why that's the case but I'll also explain why Meta investors might want to tap the brakes on their enthusiasm.\n\nI've noted that the TikTok bill made it through the House of Representatives but this doesn't mean it's now a done deal. The bill still has to make it through the Senate. And after that, it has to be signed by President Biden.\n\nGranted, there's bipartisan support for the bill and it passed the House of Representatives with ease. Therefore, it's reasonable to expect it to pass the Senate. From there, comments from President Biden make it sound like he will indeed sign it.\n\nHowever, even if the bill is signed by the president, TikTok wouldn't be in immediate danger of disappearing. Parent company ByteDance would have up to a year to become compliant with the law. By then, it's possible Biden would no longer be the president, suddenly pushing U.S. policy in another direction. Therefore, ByteDance might stall for time.\n\nFinally, ByteDance could sell TikTok. And if it does, the app might not ever leave the U.S. market, leaving the competitive landscape unchanged. This possibility is quite realistic. For example, former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin is already assembling a team of investors to buy TikTok if it goes up for sale.\n\nIn summary, Meta Platforms' shareholders shouldn't celebrate yet. The bill hasn't completely passed yet, ByteDance will have about a year to weigh its options, and TikTok may never disappear in the U.S. anyway if it's sold to a party that can keep it running.\n\nThe company sells hardware products, is pushing research in artificial intelligence (AI), and has big plans for the metaverse. But in 2023, 98% of Meta's revenue came from digital advertising. Therefore, advertising is clearly the most important thing for Meta investors to watch.\n\nDigital advertising depends on user engagement. It doesn't matter how many users a platform technically has. What matters is whether they are using the platform and can be shown an ad. And for Meta, video is a key component of user engagement.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, video watch time for Meta was up a whopping 25% year over year, which shows how quickly user engagement is growing.\n\nIn the Q4 conference call, Meta's CFO Susan Li said that video has lower levels of monetization right now. That's why the company is doing what it can to increase engagement. Regardless of what happens with TikTok, Meta is busy building its AI engine for recommending videos to viewers, which can boost engagement if done well. Given the 25% growth in Q4, there's reason to believe that Meta's AI engine is off to a good start.\n\nHowever, it stands to reason that Meta would additionally benefit if TikTok did disappear from the market. Advertisers spend money on the popular platform. But if it were banned, those dollars would flow elsewhere. And some of that spend would logically wind up with Meta.\n\nIn conclusion, the TikTok bill that just passed in the House of Representatives doesn't mean anything for Meta stock right now and it's possible that it never does. Therefore, Meta investors need to focus on what the company is doing regardless of what happens with TikTok.\n\nThat said, if things with TikTok play out a certain way, then it could eventually give Meta's business a boost. Therefore, it's not entirely immaterial to investors today and it's worth monitoring.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

Revenue was up 27 percent year-on-year to $36.5 billion, operating profit almost doubled, climbing 91 percent to $13.8 billion, and operating margin jumped from 25 percent to 38 percent.\n\nAnalysts would also normally have looked kindly upon the 10 percent drop in headcount, down to 69,329 by March 31, 2024.\n\nHowever, an otherwise rosy set of results was blighted first by the admission that Meta expects losses from its VR division, Reality Labs, to continue increasing - the operating loss was $3.8 billion for Q1 - and capital expenditure for 2024 is to increase from between $30-$37 billion to $35-$40 billion \"as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap.\"\n\nMeta didn't provide forecasts beyond 2024 but said, \"We expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts.\"\n\nThe second big knock for investors came during a call with analysts [PDF], Zuck forecast a multi-year investment cycle would be needed before Meta's AI businesses become the \"profitable services\" he expects.\n\nIt was not what analysts wanted to hear, and the company's stock was pummeled in after-hours trading. Having closed at $493.50, it stood at $424.56 at the time of writing, a fall of more than 14 percent.\n\nOther companies in the tech sector have bet big on AI, and the hype around the technology has become relentless. Microsoft, for example, has poured billions into OpenAI and crowbarred the technology into many of its products, and is trying to convince customers of the value.\n\nAs such, seeing Meta take a beating after giving an honest assessment of where it is with AI - it's going okay, but it'll take more money and more time before it starts making a substantial contribution to the bottom line - could start alarm bells ringing on Wall Street and beyond.\n\nThat said, Meta does have a particular set of problems. The CEO pointed out that it usually takes a while for the company to monetize a new product, which is fair enough until considering the ongoing losses from Meta's Reality Labs division, which is responsible for the Quest VR headset line.\n\nThe Metaverse gamble has yet to pay off. The drop in value after the results could be an early sign that investors are unwilling to wait too long for AI revenues to come close to promises.\n\nMicrosoft and Google file their latest quarterly financials tonight, and Amazon reports numbers on April 30. \u00ae", "source": {"uri": "theregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "theregister.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boss (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PDF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality headset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://regmedia.co.uk/2022/02/11/bubble_shutterstock.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 2776, "textEnd": 2784}], "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

However, a recent delay in Fed rate cuts and uncertainty in the chip sector have weighed on the Nasdaq over the past month.\n\nNow, with the start of the quarterly earnings season, the spotlight shines brightly on Meta. The social media giant will face its financial test today after the closing bell. Analysts are anticipating strong results from Mark Zuckerberg's company, with revenue expected to reach $36.223 billion - a 26.5% year-over-year increase, marking the highest growth rate since 2021.\n\nEarnings per share are also projected to nearly double compared to Q1 2023, jumping from $2.20 to $4.36. So, can Meta deliver on these high expectations and reignite the momentum for the tech sector, or will the company fall short and put Nasdaq's recent rebound under pressure?\n\nAnalysts are sharply raising their forecasts for Meta Platforms, with InvestingPro's chart showing a 59.8% increase in EPS expectations over the past year. This bullish sentiment has likely been fueled by Meta's:\n\nWhile strengths like advertising revenue growth fueled by new ad formats and advancements in AI with the launch of Meta AI promise a more engaging user experience on WhatsApp and Instagram, uncertainties remain.\n\nThe company's ambitious Metaverse project could lead to a second consecutive quarter of hefty losses exceeding $4 billion. Additionally, the upcoming US Presidential election poses a major challenge, potentially damaging Meta's credibility as concerns rise about the spread of misinformation on social media platforms.\n\nAccording to Thomas Monteiro, lead analyst at Investing.com:\n\n\"Thanks to its leaner margins and substantial free cash flows, Meta's ability to navigate the shifting interest rate narrative should be the key differentiator from its competitors this earnings season. This is particularly reassuring for investors in the current climate, where future guidance is the primary metric of interest, given the expectation of a tougher Q2.\"\n\nHe went on to add:\n\n\"The positive trend will likely get further push from the stronger-than-expected economic activity in the US and China for the period, which should once again serve as a solid catalyst for Meta's thriving ad operation. Against this backdrop, Meta's strong balance sheet, undisputed moat, and lean operation should also be perceived as a significant edge in the current war for talent, particularly in the AI space.\"\n\nHowever, Monteiro acknowledged that risks still lurk for the company ahead of the earnings report.\n\n\"Concurrently, the risk for this report lies in the company's need to show investors it is drawing closer to a scenario in which it will be able to draw substantial AI-generated revenues. Another interesting point is understanding whether a learner Metaverse operation can pay out in the mid-term. I would not be surprised by better-than-expected numbers there, but given the most recent US consumer trends, risks are still high.\"\n\nHe concluded:\n\n\"The bonus in the report would be if Zuckerberg could show investors his company is on the way to improving monetization in the WhatsApp business, which still presents significant untapped potential.\"\n\nAnalysts are showering Meta Platforms with confidence ahead of its earnings release. A survey by InvestingPro of 53 analysts projects an average stock price increase of 9.16% over the next 12 months, setting a bullish target price of $541.20.\n\nThis optimism is reflected in analyst ratings, with 51 experts recommending \"Buy\" for Meta, 7 recommending \"Hold,\" and only 2 suggesting \"Sell.\" The market clearly has high hopes for Meta, following its impressive 140% stock price growth in the past year after a challenging 2022.\n\nHowever, with great power comes great responsibility. The social media giant now faces the pressure of exceeding expectations and not disappointing the markets and investors who believe in its bullish potential.\n\n***\n\nTake advantage of a special discount to subscribe to InvestingPro+ and take advantage of all our tools to optimize your investment strategy.

The parent company of Facebook and Instagram raised its capex range for the year by 12% as part of its first-quarter report late Wednesday, with the chief executive citing the need to boost investments in generative artificial intelligence.\n\nIt is a big number that is nearly double what the company has averaged over the past five years and nearly on par with projected spending this year by Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet, two much larger companies by annual revenue.\n\nMeta projected robust spending plans three months ago, which investors took in stride because the rest of the business was performing remarkably well. Those last results fueled a big jump for its stock; Meta's 39% gain for the year to date ahead of the latest results is the sixth-best on the S&P 500.\n\nBut the latest report was a bit less impressive, with first-quarter revenue of $36.46 billion only narrowly beating Wall Street's forecast, and projected second-quarter revenue falling short of analysts' forecasts.\n\nThat second-quarter forecast, calling for revenue to grow 18% year over year at the midpoint, also represented a notable deceleration from the 27% growth seen in the just-ended period. Meta's share price tumbled more than 16% in Wednesday's after-hours session.\n\nThe world's largest social network isn't going to have any problems footing the bills. Advertising revenue jumped nearly 27% year over year to $35.6 billion for the quarter, while operating margins for the core advertising segment known as Family of Apps hit 49% in the first quarter -- nearly 10 points better than the same period a year ago.\n\nThe business of showing ads to a global audience of 3.24 billion users who check in daily is a lucrative one. Even with sharply elevated capital spending, Meta's free cash flow hit $12.5 billion in the latest quarter -- up 81% year over year.\n\nBut tech giants such as Meta, Microsoft, Google and Amazon are now pouring billions into generative AI, with the revenue contribution either unclear or a long way off.\n\nZuckerberg was at least candid on the last point, telling analysts on Wednesday's conference call, \"I expect to see a multiyear investment cycle before we've fully scaled Meta AI, business AIs, and more into the profitable services I expect as well.\"\n\nChief Financial Officer Susan Li added that capex is expected to be even higher next year, \"as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product-development efforts.\"\n\nThat is great news for Nvidia, the key supplier of the chips and computing systems necessary to power generative-AI capabilities in data centers. But it is also a sign that tech investors more broadly might have to get used to bigger spending bills before they see the benefits.\n\nMicrosoft and Google-parent Alphabet will post their own results for the March quarter on Thursday and could send a similar message. Shares of both were down between 2% and 3% after hours Wednesday following Meta's report.\n\nThe AI race is getting even more expensive, with no finish line in sight.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Share price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/04/25/600x338/im-952741_1714037397465_1714037799740.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

(Operator Instructions) This call will be recorded. Thank you very much.\n\nKen Dorell, Meta's Director of Investor Relations, you may begin.\n\nKenneth J. Dorell\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Meta Platform's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; and Susan Li, CFO.\n\nBefore we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today's earnings press release and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.\n\nAny forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\n\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The earnings press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com.\n\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\n\nAll right. Thanks, Ken, and everyone, thanks for joining. It's been a good start to the year, both in terms of product momentum and business performance. We estimate that more than 3.2 billion people use at least one of our apps each day, and we're seeing healthy growth in the U.S. And I want to call out WhatsApp specifically, where the number of daily actives and message sends in the U.S. keeps gaining momentum, and I think we're on a good path there. We've also made good progress on our AI and metaverse efforts, and that's where we're going to focus most of my comments today.\n\nSo let's start with AI. We are building a number of different AI services, from Meta AI, our AI assistant that you can ask any question across our apps and glasses, to creator AIs that help creators engage their communities and that fans can interact with, to business AIs that we think every business eventually on our platform will use to help customers buy things and get customer support to internal coding and development AIs to hardware like glasses for people to interact with AIs and a lot more.\n\nLast week, we had the major release of our new version of Meta AI that is now powered by our latest model, Llama 3. And our goal with Meta AI is to build the world's leading AI service, both in quality and usage. The initial rollout of Meta AI is going well. Tens of millions of people have already tried it. The feedback is very positive. And when I first checked in with our teams, the majority of feedback we were getting was people asking us to release Meta AI for them wherever they are.\n\nSo we've started launching Meta AI in some English speaking countries, and we'll roll out in more languages and countries over the coming months. You all know our product development playbook by this point. We released an early version of a product to a limited audience to gather feedback and start improving it. And then once we think it's ready, then we make it available to more people. That early release was last fall. And with this release, we are now moving to that next growth phase of our playbook. We believe that Meta AI with Llama 3 is now the most intelligent AIS system that you can freely use. And now that we have the superior quality product, we are making it easier for lots of people to use it within WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram and Facebook.\n\nNow in addition to answering more complex queries, a few other notable and unique features from this release. Meta AI now creates animations from still images and now generates high-quality images so fast that it can create and update them as you are typing, which is pretty awesome. I've seen a lot of people commenting about that experience online, how they've never seen or experienced anything like it before.\n\nIn terms of the core AI model and intelligence that's powering Meta AI, I'm very pleased with how Llama 3 has come together so far. The 8 billion and 70 billion parameter models that we released are best-in-class for their scale. The 400-plus billion parameter model that we're still training seems on track to be industry leading on several benchmarks. And I expect that our models are just going to improve further from open source contributions.\n\nOverall, I view the results our teams have achieved here as another key milestone in showing that we have the talent, data and ability to scale infrastructure to build the world's leading AI models and services. And this leads me to believe that we should invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models and the largest scale AI services in the world.\n\nAs we're scaling CapEx and energy expenses for AI, we'll continue focusing on operating the rest of our company efficiently. But realistically, even with shifting many of our existing resources to focus on AI, we'll still grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products. I think it's worth calling that out that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook, where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it. We saw this with Reels, Stories as newsfeed transition to mobile and more. And I also expect to see a multiyear investment cycle before we fully scale Meta AI, business AIs and more into the profitable services I expect as well.\n\nHistorically, investing to build these new scaled experiences in our apps has been a very good long-term investment for us and for investors who have stuck with us. And the initial signs are quite positive here, too. But building the leading AI will also be a larger undertaking than the other experiences we've added to our apps, and this is likely going to take several years.\n\nOn the upside, once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively. There are several ways to build a massive business here, including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions and enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute. And on top of those, AI is already helping us improve app engagement, which naturally leads to seeing more ads and improving ads directly to deliver more value.\n\nSo if the technology and products evolve in the way that we hope, each of those will unlock massive amounts of value for people and business for us over time.\n\nWe're seeing good progress on some of these efforts already. Right now, about 30% of the posts on Facebook feed are delivered by our AI recommendation system. That's up 2x over the last couple of years. And for the first time ever, more than 50% of the content that people see on Instagram is now AI recommended.\n\nAI has also been a huge part of how we create value for advertisers by showing people more relevant ads. And if you look at our 2 end-to-end AI-powered tools, Advantage+ shopping and Advantage+ app campaigns, revenue flowing through those has more than doubled since last year.\n\nWe're also going to continue to be very focused on efficiency as we scale Meta AI and other AI services. Some of this will come from improving how we train and run models. Some improvements will come from the open source community, and we're improving cost efficiency is one of the main areas that I expect that open sourcing will help us improve similar to what we saw with Open Compute. We'll also keep making progress on building more of our own silicon. Our Meta training and inference accelerator chip has successfully enabled us to run some of our recommendations-related workloads on this less expensive stack. And as this program matures over the coming years, we plan to expand this to more of our workloads as well. And of course, as we ramp these investments, we will also continue to carefully manage head count and other expense growth throughout the company.\n\nNow in addition to our work on AI, our other long-term focus is the metaverse. It's been interesting to see how these 2 themes have come together. This is clearest when you look at glasses. I used to think that AR glasses wouldn't really be a mainstream product until we had full holographic displays. And I still think that, that's going to be awesome and is the long-term mature state for the product. But now it seems pretty clear that there's also a meaningful market for fashionable AI glasses without a display.\n\nGlasses are the ideal device for an AI assistant because you can let them see what you see and hear what you hear. So they have full context on what's going on around you as they help you with whatever you're trying to do. Our launch this week of Meta AI with a vision on the glasses is a good example where you can now ask questions about things that you're looking at.\n\nNow one strategy dynamic that I've been reflecting on is that an increasing amount of our Reality Labs work is going towards serving our AI efforts. We currently report on our financials as if Family of Apps and Reality Labs were 2 completely separate businesses. But strategically, I think of them as fundamentally the same business with the vision of Reality Labs to build the next generation of computing platforms in large part so that we can build the best apps and experiences on top of them. Over time, we'll need to find better ways to articulate the value that's generated here across both segments so it doesn't just seem like our hardware costs increase as our glasses ecosystem scales, but all the value flows to a different segment.\n\nThe Ray-Ban Meta glasses that we built with EssilorLuxottica continue to do well and are sold out in many styles and colors. So we're working to make more and release additional styles as quickly as we can. We just released the new cat-eye Skyler design yesterday, which is more feminine. And in general, I'm optimistic about our approach of starting with the classics and expanding with an increasing diversity of options over time.\n\nIf we want everyone to be able to use wearable AI, I think eyewear is a bit different from phones or watches and that people are going to want very different designs. So I think our approach of partnering with the leading eyewear brands will help us serve more of the market.\n\nI think a similar open ecosystem approach will help us expand the virtual and mixed reality headset market over time as well. We announced that we're opening up Meta Horizon OS, the operating system we've built to power Quest.\n\nAs the ecosystem grows, I think there will be sufficient diversity in how people use mixed reality, that there will be demand for more designs than we'll be able to build. For example, a work-focused headset may be slightly less designed for motion but may -- you want to be lighter by connecting to your laptop; a fitness-focused headset may be lighter with sweat-wicking materials; an entertainment-focused headset may prioritize the highest resolution displays over everything else; a gaming-focused headset may prioritize peripherals and haptics or a device that comes with Xbox controllers and a game pass subscription out of the box.\n\nNow to be clear, I think that our first-party Quest devices will continue to be the most popular headsets as we see today, and we'll continue focusing on advancing the state-of-the-art tech and making it accessible to everyone. But I also think that opening our ecosystem and opening our operating system will help the overall mixed reality ecosystem grow even faster.\n\nNow in addition to AI and the metaverse, we're seeing good improvements across our apps. I touched on some of the most important trends already with WhatsApp growth in the U.S. and AI-powered recommendations in our feeds and reels already. But I do want to mention that video continues to be a bright spot. This month, we launched an updated full-screen video player on Facebook that brings together reels, longer videos and live content into a single experience with a unified recommendation system.\n\nOn Instagram, reels and video continue to drive engagement, with reels alone now making up 50% of the time that's spent within the app. Threads is growing well, too. There are now more than 150 million monthly actives. And it continues to generally be on the trajectory that I hope to see. And of course, my daughters would want me to mention that Taylor Swift is now on Threads. That one was a big deal in my house.\n\nAll right. That is what I wanted to cover today. I am proud of the progress we've made so far this year. We've got a lot more execution ahead to fulfill the opportunities ahead of us. A big thank you to all of our teams who are driving all these advances and to all of you for being on this journey with us.\n\nAnd now here is Susan.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\n\nThanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q1 total revenue was $36.5 billion, up 27% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Q1 total expenses were $22.6 billion, up 6% compared to last year.\n\nIn terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 9% as higher infrastructure-related costs were partially offset by lapping Reality Labs' inventory-related valuation adjustments. R&D increased 6%, driven mostly by higher head count-related expenses and infrastructure costs, which were partially offset by lower restructuring costs.\n\nMarketing and sales decreased 16% due mainly to lower restructuring costs, professional services and marketing spend. G&A increased 20% as higher legal-related expenses were partially offset by lower restructuring costs.\n\nWe ended the first quarter with over 69,300 employees, up 3% from Q4. First quarter operating income was $13.8 billion, representing a 38% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 13%. Net income was $12.4 billion or $4.71 per share.\n\nCapital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $6.7 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $12.5 billion. We repurchased $14.6 billion of our Class A common stock and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders, ending the quarter with $58.1 billion in cash and marketable securities and $18.4 billion in debt.\n\nMoving now to our segment results. I'll begin with our Family of Apps segment. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, with approximately 3.2 billion people using at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in March. Q1 total Family of Apps revenue was $36 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Q1 Family of Apps ad revenue was $35.6 billion, up 27% or 26% on a constant currency basis. Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth, followed by gaming and entertainment and media.\n\nOn a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World and Europe at 40% and 33%, respectively. Asia Pacific grew 25% and North America grew 22%. In Q1, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 20%, and the average price per ad increased 6%. Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia Pacific and Rest of World. Pricing growth was driven by advertiser demand, which was partially offset by strong impression growth, particularly from lower-monetizing regions and services.\n\nFamily of Apps other revenue was $380 million in Q1, up 85%, driven by business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp business platform. We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q1, Family of Apps expenses were $18.4 billion, representing approximately 81% of our overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were up 7% due mainly to higher legal and infrastructure costs that were partially offset by lower restructuring costs.\n\nFamily of Apps operating income was $17.7 billion, representing a 49% operating margin. Within our Reality Labs segment, Q1 revenue was $440 million, up 30%, driven by Quest headset sales. Reality Labs expenses were $4.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year as higher head count-related expenses were more than offset by lapping inventory-related valuation adjustments and restructuring costs. Reality Labs operating loss was $3.8 billion.\n\nTurning now to the business outlook. There are 2 primary factors that drive our revenue performance: our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. On the first, we remain pleased with engagement trends and have strong momentum across our product priorities. Our investments in developing increasingly advanced recommendation systems continue to drive incremental engagement on our platform, demonstrating that people are finding added value by discovering content from accounts they are not connected to. The level of recommended content in our apps has scaled as we've improved these systems, and we see further opportunity to increase the relevance and personalization of recommendations as we advance our models.\n\nVideo also continues to grow across our platform, and it now represents more than 60% of time on both Facebook and Instagram. Reels remains the primary driver of that growth, and we're progressing on our work to bring together Reel's longer-form video and live video into one experience on Facebook.\n\nIn April, we rolled out this unified video experience in the U.S. and Canada, which is increasingly powered by our next-generation ranking architecture that we expect will help deliver more relevant video recommendations over time.\n\nWe're also introducing deeper integrations of generative AI into our apps in the U.S. and more than a dozen other countries. Along with using Meta AI within our chat surfaces, people will now be able to use Meta AI in search within our apps as well as feed and groups on Facebook. We expect these integrations will complement our social discovery strategy as our recommendation systems help people to discover and explore their interests, while Meta AI enables them to dive deeper on topics they're interested in. Threads also continues to see good traction as we continue to ship valuable features and scale the community.\n\nNow to the second driver of our revenue performance, increasing monetization efficiency. There are 2 parts to this work. The first is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. Here, we continue to advance our understanding of users' preferences for viewing ads to more effectively optimize the right time, place and person to show an ad to.\n\nFor example, we are getting better at adjusting the placement and number of ads in real time based on our perception of a user's interest and ad content and to minimize disruption from ads as well as innovating on new and creative ad formats. We expect to continue that work going forward, while surfaces with relatively lower levels of monetization, like video and messaging, will serve as additional growth opportunities.\n\nThe second part of improving monetization efficiency is enhancing marketing performance. Similar to our work with organic recommendations, AI is playing an increasing role in these efforts. First, we are making ongoing ads modeling improvements that are delivering better performance for advertisers. One example is our new ads ranking architecture, Meta Lattice, which we began rolling out more broadly last year. This new architecture allows us to run significantly larger models that generalize learnings across objectives and surfaces in place of numerous smaller ad models that have historically been optimized for individual objectives and surfaces. This is not only leading to increased efficiency as we operate fewer models but also improving ad performance.\n\nAnother way we're leveraging AI is to provide increased automation for advertisers. Through our Advantage+ portfolio, advertisers can automate one step of the campaign setup process, such as selecting which ad creative to show, or automate their campaign completely using our end-to-end automation tools, Advantage+ shopping and Advantage+ app ads. We're seeing growing use of these solutions, and we expect to drive further adoption over the course of the year while applying what we learned to our broader ads investments.\n\nNext, I'd like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. We continue to see compelling investment opportunities to both improve our core business in the near term and capture significant longer-term opportunities in generative AI and Reality Labs. As we develop more advanced and compute-intensive recommendation models and scale capacity for our generative AI training and inference needs, we expect that having sufficient infrastructure capacity will be critical to realizing many of these opportunities. As a result, we expect that we will invest significantly more in infrastructure over the coming years.\n\nOur other long-term initiatives that we're continuing to make significant investments in is Reality Labs. We are also starting to see our AI initiatives increasingly overlap with our Reality Labs work. For example, with Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, people in the U.S. and Canada can now use our multimodal Meta AI assistant for daily tasks without pulling out their phone.\n\nLonger term, we expect generative AI to play an increasing role in our mixed reality products, making it easier to develop immersive experiences. Accelerating our AI efforts will help ensure we can provide the best version of our services as we transition to the next computing platform. We expect to pursue these opportunities while maintaining a focus on operating discipline, and we believe our strong financial position will allow us to support these investments while also returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\n\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. We also have a jury trial scheduled for June in a suit brought by the state of Texas regarding our use of facial recognition technology, which could ultimately result in a material loss.\n\nTurning now to the revenue outlook. We expect second quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $36.5 billion to $39 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is a 1% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth based on current exchange rates.\n\nTurning now to the expense outlook. We expect full year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96 million to $99 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $94 million to $99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs.\n\nFor Reality Labs, we continue to expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and our investments to further scale our ecosystem.\n\nTurning now to the CapEx outlook. We anticipate our full year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, increased from our prior range of $30 billion to $37 billion as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI road map. While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect CapEx will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts.\n\nOn to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens.\n\nIn closing, Q1 was a good start to the year. We're seeing strong momentum within our Family of Apps and are making important progress on our longer-term AI and Reality Labs initiatives that have the potential to transform the way people interact with our services over the coming years.\n\nWith that, Krista, let's open up the call for questions.\n\n(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs.\n\nEric James Sheridan\n\nMaybe I'll ask a two-parter. Mark, you used the analogy of other investments cycles you've been through around products like Stories and Reels. I know you're not giving long-term guidance today, but using those analogies, how should investors think about the length and depth of this investment cycle with respect to either AI and/or Reality Labs more broadly and mixed reality?\n\nAnd you both talked about the impact AI is having on the advertising ecosystem. What are you watching for in terms of adoption or utility on the consumer side to know that AI adoption is tracking along with the investment cycle?\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\n\nYes. In terms of the timing, I think it's somewhat difficult to extrapolate from previous cycles. But I guess like the main thing that we see is that we will usually take, I don't know, a couple of years, I mean, it could be a little more, it could be less to focus on building out and scaling the products. And we typically don't focus that much on monetization of the new areas until they reach significant scale because it's so much higher leverage for us just to improve monetization on other things before these new products are at scale.\n\nSo you enter this period where I think kind of smart investors see that the product is scaling and that there's a clear monetizable opportunity there even before the revenue materializes. And I think we've seen that with Reels and with Stories and with the shift to mobile and all these things, where basically, we build out the inventory first for a period of time and then we monetize it.\n\nAnd during that time, when it's scaling, sometimes it's not just the case that we're not making money from that thing. It can often actually be the case that it displaces other revenue from other things. So like you saw with Reels, I mean, it scaled and there was a period where it was not profitable for us as it was scaling before it became profitable. So I think that's more the analogy that I'm making on this.\n\nBut I think it's -- what that suggests is that what we should all be focused on for the next period is as the consumer products scale, Meta AI really just launched in a meaningful way so we don't have any kind of hard stats to share on that. But I'd say that's the main thing that I'm focused on for this year and probably a lot of next year is growing that product and the other AI products and the engagement around them. And I think we should all have quite a bit of confidence that if those are on a good track to scale, then they're going to end up being very large businesses. So that's the main point that I was trying to make there.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.\n\nBrian Thomas Nowak\n\nThanks for taking my questions, I have 2. The first one is on sort of the recommendation engine improvements and even, Susan, when you talked about further opportunities to increase the relevance of the models. Could you just unpack that a little bit for us? Can you give us examples of where you're still running the model in a suboptimal basis or opportunities for improved signal capture use or data you're not using? Where are sort of the areas of improvement you see from here?\n\nAnd then the second one, when you talk about driving incremental adoption of AI tools for advertisers, what are sort of some of the main gating factors you've encountered to get advertisers to test these tools? And how do you think about sort of addressing that throughout '24 and '25?\n\nSusan J. S. Li\n\nThanks, Brian. So to your first question, where are there more opportunities for us to leverage and improve our recommendations models to drive engagement? One of the things I would say is, historically, each of our recommendation products, including Reels, in-feed recommendations, et cetera, has had their own AI model.\n\nAnd recently, we've been developing a new model architecture with the aim for it to power multiple recommendations products. We started partially validating this model last year by using it to power Facebook Reels. And we saw meaningful performance gains, 8% to 10% increases in watch time as a result of deploying this.\n\nThis year, we're actually planning to extend the singular model architecture to recommend content across not just Facebook Reels, but also Facebook's video tab as well. So while it's still too early to share specific results, we're optimistic that the new model architecture will unlock increasingly relevant video recommendations over time. And if it's successful, we'll explore using it to power other recommendations.\n\nAnd analog exists, I would say, on the ad side. We've talked a little bit about the new model architecture Meta Lattice that we deployed last year that consolidates smaller and more specialized models into larger models that can better learn what characteristics improve ad performance across multiple services, like feed and Reels and multiple types of ads and objectives at the same time. And that's driven improved ad performance over the course of 2023 as we deployed it across Facebook and Instagram to support multiple objectives.\n\nAnd over the course of 2024, we expect to further enhance model performance and include support for even more objectives like web and app and ROAS. So there's a lot of work that we're investing in, in the underlying model architecture for both organic engagement and ads that we expect is going to continue to deliver increasing ads performance over time.\n\nThe second question you asked was around getting advertisers to test and adopt gen AI tools. There are 2 flavors of this. The more near-term version is around the gen AI ad creative features that we have put into our ads creation tools. And it's early, but we're seeing adoption of these features across verticals and different advertiser sizes.\n\nIn particular, we've seen outsized adoption of image expansion with small businesses, and this will remain a big area of focus for us in 2024, and I expect that improvements to our underlying foundation models will enhance the quality of the outputs that are generated and support new features on the road map. But right now, we have features supporting text variations, image expansion and background generation, and we're continuing to work to make those more performant for advertisers to create more personalized ads at scale.\n\nThe longer-term piece here is around business AIs. We have been testing the ability for businesses to set up AIs for business messaging that represent them in chats with customers, starting by supporting shopping use cases such as responding to people asking for more information on a product or its availability. So this is very, very early. We've been testing this with a handful of businesses on Messenger and WhatsApp, and we're hearing good feedback with businesses saying that the AIs have saved them significant time while customer -- consumers noted more timely response times. And we're also learning a lot from these tests to make these AIs more performant over time as well. So we'll be expanding these tests over the coming months, and we'll continue to take our time here to get it right before we make it more broadly available.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik from Bernstein Research.\n\nMark Elliott Shmulik\n\nI guess back to that product playbook that we talked about a few times, with kind of Reels now such a large share of kind of time spent on Instagram and Facebook, how do we think about the next leg of kind of monetization growth from here? In particular, as we kind of get back to kind of shopping on platform or other ways to monetize, any color there on the road map kind of just beyond ad insertion from here?\n\nAnd then, Susan, just on the ad market, in particular, previously, we heard a lot about kind of Chinese-based advertiser contribution. Any color you could share there on kind of how that spend is trending?\n\nSusan J. S. Li\n\nSure. Thanks, Mark. So Reels revenue continued to grow across Instagram and Facebook in Q1, and that's driven both by higher engagement and increased monetization efficiency through our ads ranking and delivery improvements. And we -- as we've mentioned before, we don't plan on quantifying the impact from Reels going forward, but it remains a positive contributor to overall revenue. And we expect that there are going to be opportunities for us to continue improving performance and growing supply.\n\nSo on the performance improvements, we are investing in ongoing ranking improvements. We're continuing to make ads easier and more intuitive to interact with through work like optimizing call to actions and post-click experiences, which are especially important for DR performance. And we're also optimizing ads to feel more native to Reels.\n\nIn Q1, we rolled out our gen AI image expansion tools across Facebook and Instagram Reels after having introduced it to Instagram feed in Q4, and we're seeing, again, outsized adoption with small businesses. So we're excited about the opportunities to continue making these ads more performant. And even though ads -- the Reels ad loads, sorry, has increased over the last year, it remains lower on a per time basis than both Feed and Stories. So we're going to continue to look for opportunities to thoughtfully grow it in the future and invest in creative ways to address the structural supply constraints of the Reels format being more video-heavy, including higher density experiences and formats and increasingly personalizing ad loads, which we think will make sure that we're really putting ads in front of people when they're most likely to be interested and engaged with them.\n\nThe second question you asked was around China. Growth in spend from China advertisers remained strong in Q1. This was driven by online commerce and gaming, and it's reflected in our Asia Pacific advertisers segment, which remained the fastest-growing region, at 41% year-over-year in Q1. Now we did see strength across other geographies as well, including a 6-point acceleration in total revenue growth from North America advertisers.\n\nSo I would say that we aren't quantifying the Q1 contribution from China, and we don't have forward-looking expectations to share on quarterly China-based ad revenue, but I will say that we are lapping periods of increasingly strong demand over the course of 2024 given the recovery of China-based advertisers in 2023 from their prior pandemic-driven headwinds.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.\n\nDouglas Till Anmuth\n\nCan you just talk about what's changed most in your view in the business and the opportunity now versus 3 months ago? And is there anything you're more cautious about in revenue in the ad market? And is the AI opportunity just even bigger, and therefore, requiring more investment than expected?\n\nAnd then, Susan, can you also just comment on how you're thinking about that ability to sustain growth rates over the next few quarters as you face tougher comps off a big base of ad dollars?\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\n\nYes, I can speak to the first one. I think we've gotten more optimistic and ambitious on AI. So previously, I think that our work in this -- I mean when you were looking at last year, when we released Llama 2, we were very excited about the model and thought that, that was going to be the basis to be able to build a number of things that were valuable that integrated into our social products. But now I think we're in a pretty different place. So with the latest models, we're not just building good AI models that are going to be capable of building some new good social and commerce products. I actually think we're in a place where we've shown that we can build leading models and be the leading AI company in the world. And that opens up a lot of additional opportunities beyond just ones that are the most obvious ones for us.\n\nSo that's -- this is what I was trying to refer to in my opening remarks where I just view the success that we've seen with the way that Llama 3 and Meta AI have come together as a real validation technically that we have the talent, the data and the ability to scale infrastructure to do leading work here.\n\nAnd with Meta AI, I think that we are on our path to having Meta AI be the most used and best AI assistant in the world, which I think is going to be enormously valuable. So all of that basically encourages me to make sure that we're investing to stay at the leading edge of this.\n\nAnd we're doing that at the time when we're also scaling the product before it is making money. So that's the analogy that I was making before, which is we've gone through some of those cycles before. But fundamentally, I think if you look at the facts of what our team is able to produce, I think it just -- our optimism and ambition have just grown quite a bit, and I think that this is just going to end up being quite an important set of products for us. So it was already going to be. Now I think it has the potential to be even more important.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\n\nAnd I can take that second question, Doug. So we aren't giving full year 2024 guidance. And obviously, our revenue for the full year will be influenced by many factors, including macro conditions and things that are harder to predict the further out you go. And of course, over the course of 2024, we will also be lapping periods of increasingly strong demand. With that said, we expect to see good opportunities to continue growing engagement across our products, driven by the investments we made in AI-based content recommendations, our ongoing video work. And we also expect that we will continue to drive ads performance gains and continue to make our ads sort of more effective and deliver increasing value to advertisers.\n\nOne thing I'd share, for example, is that we actually grew conversions at a faster rate than we grew impressions over the course of this quarter. So we are -- we're expecting to -- which basically suggests that our conversion grade is growing and is one of the ways in which our ads are becoming more performant. So I feel like there's a lot of opportunity for us, both with our organic engagement growth and with continuing to make the ads better and to continue driving more results for advertisers.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America.\n\nJustin Post\n\nFirst on the CapEx, mostly, you're kind of talking about an investment cycle here. Is there any way you could kind of use some of the metaverse spend over into AI? Are they converging and kind of use some of the money from the other areas to kind of fund the AI?\n\nAnd then second, longer-term investors are very focused on returns on capital. Obviously, great returns on CapEx in the past with your margins today. How do we think about the returns on the capital you're spending? How are you thinking about it, I guess, going forward 2, 3 years out?\n\nSusan J. S. Li\n\nSo on the -- I would say -- well, I can start with the second part, and then I'll defer to Mark on the first one. In terms of measuring the ROI on our CapEx investments, we've broadly categorized our AI investments into 2 buckets. I think of them as sort of core AI work and then strategic bets, which would include gen AI and the advanced research efforts to support that. And those are just really at different stages as it relates to being able to measure the return and drive revenue for our business. So with our core AI work, we continue to have a very ROI-driven approach to investment, and we're still seeing strong returns as improvements to both engagement and ad performance have translated into revenue gains.\n\nNow the second area, strategic bets, is where we are much earlier. Mark has talked about the potential that we believe we have to create significant value for our business in a number of areas, including opportunities to build businesses that don't exist on us today. But we'll need to invest ahead of that opportunity to develop more advanced models and to grow the usage of our products before they drive meaningful revenue.\n\nSo while there is tremendous long-term potential, we're just much earlier on the return curve than with our core AI work. What I'll say though is we're also building our systems in a way that gives us fungibility in how we use our capacity so we can flex it across different use cases as we identify what are the best opportunities to put that infrastructure toward.\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\n\nAnd then on the question of shifting resources from other parts of the company. I would say, broadly, we actually are doing that in a lot of places in terms of shifting resources from other areas, whether it's compute resources or different things in order to advance the AI efforts. For Reality Labs specifically, I'm still really optimistic about building these new computing platforms long term. I mentioned in my remarks upfront that one of the bigger areas that we're investing in Reality Labs is glasses. We think that that's going to be a really important platform for the future.\n\nOur outlook for that, I think, has improved quite a bit because previously, we thought that, that would need to wait until we have these full holographic displays to be a large market. And now we're a lot more focused on the glasses that we're delivering in partnership with Ray-Ban, which I think are going really well. And -- so that, I think, has the ability to be a pretty meaningful and growing platform sooner than I would have expected. So it is true that more of the Reality Labs work, like I said, is sort of focused on the AI goals as well. But I still think that we should focus on building these long-term platforms, too.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali from Truist Securities.\n\nYoussef Houssaini Squali\n\nMark, with the upcoming ban or sale of TikTok signed into law earlier today, how do you think that will impact the U.S. social media landscape? And then, in particular, what do you say to people who believe that this is potentially a slippery slope in terms of the government picking up -- picking winners and losers?\n\nAnd Susan, how big is Advantage+ in terms of the spend on the platform and just in terms of its impact on overall CPM stabilizing?\n\nSusan J. S. Li\n\nThanks, Youssef. We've obviously been following the events related to TikTok closely, but at this stage, it is just too early, I think, to assess its impact or what it would mean for our business.\n\nTo your second question on Advantage+, we're continuing to see good traction across our Advantage+ portfolio, including both with solutions, I mentioned this, that automate individual steps of a campaign creation setup as well as ones that automate the full end-to-end process. So on the single-step automation, Advantage+ audience, for example, has seen significant growth in adoption since we made it the default audience creation experience for most advertisers in Q4. And that enables advertisers to increase campaign performance by just using audience inputs as a suggestion rather than a hard constraint. And based on tests that we ran, campaigns using Advantage+ audience targeting saw, on average, a 28% decrease in cost per click or per objective compared to using our regular targeting.\n\nOn the end-to-end automation products like Advantage+ shopping and Advantage+ app campaigns, we're also seeing very strong growth. Mark mentioned the combined revenue flowing through those 2 has more than doubled since last year. And we think there's still significant runway to broaden adoption, so we're trying to enable more conversion types for Advantage+ shopping. In Q1, we began expanding the list of conversions that businesses could optimize for. So previously, it only supported purchase events, and now we've added 10 additional conversion types. And we're continuing to see strong adoption now across verticals.\n\nSo generally, I would say we are building a lot more functionality into the Advantage+ tools over time. also where a lot of our gen AI ads creative features have been introduced and where advertisers have the opportunity to experiment with those. And we'll keep looking to apply what we learn from these products more broadly to our ads investments over the course of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ken Gawrelski from Wells Fargo.\n\nKenneth James Gawrelski\n\nAs you look out through the coming period of product investment, how should we think about the relationship between Family of Apps revenue and cost growth? Is there any insight you can give us there?\n\nAnd then maybe just one that's a little bit more specific to the G&A growth in 1Q. You called out legal expenses. Just wanted to see if there's anything onetime in there that would cause the elevated growth in 1Q.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\n\nYes. On the second part of your question first, so on the G&A side, that was really driven by legal expenses. We recognized some accruals in Q1 related to ongoing legal matters, and you'll see more detail on that in the 10-Q.\n\nOn the first part of your question, which is really about sort of the kind of long-term margin profile of Family of Apps, we aren't giving guidance on that per se. But one of the things that we really have been very disciplined about over the course of 2023 and continuing is really operating the business in a very efficiency oriented way. So we're being very disciplined with allocation of new resources. This is a muscle that we really built over 2023 that we believe is important for us to keep carrying forward. And I think you'll see us continue to emphasize that, especially with the Family of Apps business being at the scale that it is.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays.\n\nRoss Adam Sandler\n\nGreat. Mark, you partnered with Google and Bing for Meta AI organic search citations. So I guess stepping back, do you think that Meta AI longer term could bring in search advertising dollars at some point? Or do you view this as what others are doing, where you kind of attach a premium subscription tier once people kind of get going on it?\n\nAnd then the second question is, you mentioned that you guys are working on building AI tools for businesses and creators. So just, I guess, how do you see the business model evolving when we all get to the stage of interacting with something like Taylor Swift's custom AI for merchandise or tickets or something like that. How is that going to play out?\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\n\nAll right. So yes, on the Google and Microsoft partnerships, yes, I mean we work with them to have real-time information in Meta AI. It's useful. I think it's pretty different from search. We're not working on search ads or anything like that. I think this will end up being a pretty different business.\n\nI do think that there will be an ability to have ads and paid content in Meta AI interactions over time as well as people being able to pay for whether it's bigger models or more compute or some of the premium features and things like that. But that's all very early in fleshing out.\n\nThe thing that I actually think is probably -- the biggest clear opportunity is all the work around business messaging. That's in addition to the stuff that we're already doing, just generate to increase engagement and ads quality in the apps. But business messaging thing, I mean, whether it's a creator or one of the 100-plus million businesses on our platform, we basically want to make it very easy for all of these folks to set up an AI to engage with their community. For a business, that's going to be able to do sales and commerce and customer support. And I think it will be similar for creators, although there will be more of a kind of just fun and engaging part there, but a lot of creators are on the platform because they see this as a business too, whether they're trying to sell concert tickets or products or whatever it is that their business goal is.\n\nAnd a lot of these folks either aren't advertising as much as they could or, in business, the business messaging parts, I think, are still relatively undermonetized compared to where they will be. And I think a lot of that is because the cost of engaging with people in messaging is still very high. But AI should bring that down just dramatically for businesses and creators. And I think that, that has the potential. That's probably the -- beyond just increasing engagement and increasing the quality of the ads, I think that, that's probably one of the nearer-term opportunities, even though that will -- it's not like next quarter or the quarter after that scaling thing, but it's -- but that's not like a 5-year opportunity either.\n\nSo I think -- that is one that I think is going to be pretty exciting to look at. But yes, I mean, as Meta AI scales too, I think that, that will have its own opportunities to monetize, and we'll build that out over time. But like I tried to emphasize, we're in the phase of this where the main goal is getting many hundreds of millions or billions of people to use Meta AI as a core part of what they do. That's the kind of next goal, building something that is super valuable. We think this has the potential to be at a very large scale. And that's sort of the next step on the journey.\n\nAnd that question comes from the line of Ron Josey from Citi.\n\nRonald Victor Josey\n\nMark, I want to follow up on a prior question that you mentioned optimism has grown internally quite a bit just with all the improvements and investments and innovations you're making. And we're seeing that in the experience for a few days of Meta AI. So can you just talk to us maybe how the $400 billion parameter model just might evolve the experience on Meta or how you think things might change over the next, call it, months, years, et cetera, as maybe messaging becomes a greater focus and things along those lines? So just a vision longer term.\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\n\nYes. I mean I think that the next phase for a lot of these things are handling more complex tasks and becoming more like agents rather than just chat bots, right? So when I say chatbot, what I mean is you send it a message and it replies to your message, right? So it's almost like almost a 1:1 correspondence.\n\nWhereas what an agent is going to do is you give it an intent or a goal, then it goes off and probably actually performs many queries on its own in the background in order to help accomplish your goal, whether that goal is researching something online or eventually finding the right thing that you're looking to buy. There's a lot of complexity and sort of different things. I think people don't even realize that they will be able to ask computers to do for them.\n\nAnd I think basically, the larger models and then the more advanced future versions that will be smaller as well are just going to enable much more interesting interactions like that. So I mean if you think about this, I mean, even some of the business use cases that we talked about, you don't really just want like sales or customer support chatbot that can just respond to what you say. And if you're a business, you have a goal, right? You're trying to support your customers well and you're trying to position your products in a certain way and encourage people to buy certain things that map to their interests and would they be interested in? And that's more of like a multiturn interaction, right?\n\nSo the type of business agent that you're going to be able to enable with just a chatbot is going to be very naive compared to what we're going to have in a year even, but beyond that, too, is just the reasoning and planning abilities if these things grow to be able to just help guide people through the business process of engaging with whatever your goals are as a creator of a business.\n\nSo I think that that's going to be extremely powerful. And I think the opportunity is really big. So -- and on top of that, I think what we've shown now is that we have the ability to build leading models in our company. So I think it makes sense to go for it, and we're going to. And I think it's going to be a really good long-term investment. But I did just want to spell out on this call today, the extent to which we're focusing on this and investing in this for the long term because that's what we do.\n\nKenneth J. Dorell\n\nGreat. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your time, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call.

However, despite the stellar financial performance, the company faced a sharp decline in share prices during after-hours trading, predominantly due to lukewarm revenue projections for the upcoming quarter.\n\nThe tech titan's profit skyrocketed in the January-March period, reaching $12.37 billion, equivalent to $4.71 per share, marking a significant leap from $5.71 billion, or $2.20 per share, recorded in the same period last year. This surge in profit was propelled by a substantial increase in advertising revenue, coupled with a 6% rise in average ad prices across its platforms, according to AP.\n\nMoreover, Meta's revenue for the quarter witnessed a 27% uptick, soaring to $36.46 billion compared to $28.65 billion a year ago. These figures outperformed analyst expectations, with a FactSet poll revealing that analysts had anticipated earnings of $4.32 per share on revenue of $36.14 billion, slightly lower than Meta's reported numbers.\n\nDespite the healthy financial figures, Meta's shares plummeted by 16% during after-hours trading, as investors reacted to the company's subdued revenue projections for the current quarter. Meta anticipates its revenue for the upcoming quarter to range between $36.5-39 billion, surpassing analyst expectations of $38.25 billion.\n\nMeta disclosed plans for heightened capital expenses in 2024, primarily directed towards investments in artificial intelligence (AI). The company forecasts expenses in the range of $35-40 billion. CEO Mark Zuckerberg underscored Meta's dedication to AI advancements, announcing new AI systems geared towards enhancing user experience.\n\nEarlier in April, Meta introduced a new suite of AI systems, touted by Zuckerberg as \"the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use.\" Meta's strides in AI development place it among the leaders in the space alongside tech giants like Google and OpenAI. Notably, startups such as Anthropic, Cohere, and France's Mistral have also been making waves with the release of new AI language models.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta reported a steady 7% year-on-year increase in the number of users across its suite of apps, which includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, boasting an average of 3.24 billion users in March. However, the company announced it would no longer disclose user figures specifically for Facebook.\n\nIn tandem with its financial success, Meta witnessed a 10% year-on-year decrease in its workforce, with CEO Zuckerberg attributing the reduction to a year focused on efficiency, resulting in thousands of layoffs. As of March 31, Meta had 69,329 employees.\n\nFor investment related articles, business news and mutual fund advise Allow Notifications You have already subscribed Story first published: Thursday,

Delivering better revenue growth, it's also cheaper than smaller peers like Snap Inc. and Pinterest Inc.\n\nBut to keep a rally that's added more than US$360 billion in market value going, Meta must show it can maintain such growth when it reports earnings on Wednesday. Of particular interest to investors: seeing a return on investment from hefty spending on artificial intelligence.\n\n\"The case is still there with some of the initiatives around AI and everything they're doing to continue to improve targeting and engagement,\" Hanna Howard, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said. \"There's still room for growth on the top line and to continue to improve in margins. And, where it's trading right now, at these levels it does still look attractive.\"\n\nShares fell as much as 2.3 per cent on Wednesday.\n\nIn February, Meta reported massive growth in both earnings and revenue in the fourth quarter, which also illustrated the impact of cost-cutting measures that included thousands of job cuts. It also announced a $50 billion buyback program and implemented a dividend. In contrast, both Snap and Pinterest delivered disappointing growth.\n\nThat has set up high expectations that may be difficult to overcome. This time around, Meta's profit is expected to nearly double in the first quarter, while revenue is seen growing by 26 per cent. Still, both are expected to wane later in the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nInvestors will be looking for updates on AI, which Meta has been using to improve ad targeting. The company recently debuted a new version of its AI model, which will run its in-app AI assistant.\n\n\"Meta has really evolved from a social play to more of an AI one, and it has a lot of tailwinds from that,\" said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. \"Plus, while there were some growing pains with its year of efficiency, it is a lot more efficient now.\"\n\nWith the stock clearly outperforming Snap, Pinterest and Reddit this year, Meta continues to look like the bargain of the group. The stock trades at 23 times estimated earnings, a discount to both its 10-year average and the overall Nasdaq 100 Index, as well as being cheaper than social peers.\n\nWhile Meta faces scrutiny around parameters for teens and children on its social media sites, it could benefit from some pending social media limitations. The U.S. government is aiming to shut down TikTok, one of Meta's biggest rivals, with a divest-or-ban bill that is headed to the Senate.

The investor reaction on Wednesday indicated deepening concerns.\n\nIn a research note on Monday about Alphabet, analysts from New Street Research said the potential for materially higher capital expenditures was a worry ahead of results on Thursday.\n\nThe research firm said it now expects Alphabet's full-year capital expenditures to be $45.9 billion, up from its previous estimate of $42.7 billion.\n\nGoogle has been working to catch up in the generative AI race and released Gemini, a model that can understand and create different types of information including text, audio and video.\n\nCreating content with generative AI is energy-intensive, and Zuckerberg cited the cost as a reason for Meta's higher expenses.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft has positioned itself to be a winner in AI due to its partnership with OpenAI, which kicked off the generative AI craze last year with ChatGPT, said analysts from Jefferies in a note on March 31.\n\nMicrosoft has integrated chatbots into its suite of Office products and is planning to invest more in data centers.\n\nIndustry-wide, shareholders are now focused on looking for revenue, including pricing models and whether customers can find use cases that justify the cost of generative AI, Jefferies wrote.\n\n\"Last year was spent dreaming of gen AI's potential,\" the analysts wrote. \"This year will be about moving forward with concrete steps.\"", "source": {"uri": "dtnext.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "dtNext.in"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@dtnext.in", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://dtnext-prod.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/h-upload/2024/04/25/818481-ai.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-31", "textStart": 2393, "textEnd": 2401}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Give it a verbose paragraph, and it will tighten it up. Stuck in passive voice? Meta AI can rewrite it for active voice and add context. Technical jargon bogging you down? The AI can translate it into plain language. So basically, it's Grammarly with a bit less functionality, but it is free.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting feature is Meta AI's image generation. Describe what you want in a few words, and the AI will create an image in seconds.\n\nBut within the context of chatting with friends, Meta AI offers a fun way to add a creative touch to your conversations.\n\nWhile Meta AI isn't perfect, it offers a glimpse into the future of AI assistants.

Street investors are reportedly uneasy about Meta's multi-billion-dollar artificial intelligence (AI) plans.\n\nThe company's stock fell 15% in early trading Thursday (April 25), Bloomberg News reported, despite CEO Mark Zuckerberg's efforts to reassure investors as the tech giant released its quarterly earnings.\n\n\"For all Meta's bold AI plans, it can't afford to take its eye off the nucleus of the business -- its core advertising activities,\" Sophie Lund-Yates, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a note, per the Bloomberg report. \"That doesn't mean ignoring AI, but it does mean that spending needs to be targeted and in line with a clear strategic view.\"\n\nAs reported here Wednesday (April 24), Meta's earnings showed that, rather than accelerating its return on investment on AI, the company plans to spend $5 billion more than it had originally planned to build new artificial intelligence products for consumers, developers, businesses and hardware manufacturers.\n\nMeta's capital expenditures on AI and the metaverse-development division Reality Labs will range from $35 billion to $40 billion by the end of this year.\n\nZuckerberg touched on last week's introduction of the latest version of its AI assistant, Meta AI, powered by the latest advances of its large language model (LLM) Meta Llama 3. \"I expect that our models are just going to improve further from open source contributions,\" he said.\n\n\"Overall ... our teams have achieved another key milestone in showing that we have the talent, data and ability to scale infrastructure to build the world's leading AI models and services,\" the CEO added.\n\n\"And this leads me to believe that we should invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models and the largest scale AI services in the world.\"\n\nAs the Bloomberg report notes, it isn't the first time Zuckerberg has pleaded for patience with investors as the company embarked on big technology projects, such as Reality Labs, which lost $16 billion in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, PYMNTS examined the features of Llama 3 in recent interviews with industry experts such as Austin Vance, CEO of digital transformation firm Focused Labs.\n\nHe said one of Llama 3's main advantages is that it comes in both large and small models, with the latter outperforming the accessible version of OpenAI's GPT 3.5 Turbo, with faster inference times and the additional benefit of being open source.\n\n\"This allows enterprises to deploy the model on their own infrastructure using relatively affordable hardware, giving them control over their security environment, data and development workflows without incurring significant costs associated with OpenAI,\" said Vance.", "source": {"uri":

As such, shares are entering the 'penalty box,'\" Baird Equity Research analysts said.\n\nMeta forecast April-June revenue below estimates and raised the bottom end of its 2024 total expense forecast by $2 billion on Wednesday. It also raised the top end of its capital expenditure view as it invests in data centers essential to its efforts to catch up with AI frontrunners OpenAI and Microsoft.\n\nThe dour expectations follow a series of smash-hit earnings that helped Meta nearly triple its stock in 2023 and powered the biggest one-day market value gain by any company in Wall Street history, of $196 billion, in February after its maiden dividend.\n\nStill, several analysts were positive on the investments, pointing to AI-driven engagement on content such as Instagram Reels and the warm reception for its virtual assistant Meta AI and early versions of its latest large language model, Llama 3.\n\n\"We think this time it is different,\" said Evercore ISI analysts. \"This investment cycle comes from a position of strength, as management continues to see a healthy ad demand environment into Q2 and improving user engagement.\"\n\nOverall, 17 analysts lowered their price targets on the stock, while eight raised their view, according to LSEG data. The median price target now stands at $525, which is about 6 per cent higher than its previous close.\n\nThe stock has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 23.12, compared with Microsoft's 31.17 and Alphabet's 22.07. It has gained nearly 40 per cent so far this year, comfortably above the benchmark S&P 500 index's 6 per cent gain.\n\n\"Being on the offensive with investment spending is generally great, but in internet it's very hard to underwrite which of those investments will pay back and when,\" Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik said.\n\n\"All of this culminates with investors wondering just how long this investment cycle will last, whether the opportunity and payback is real, all against a backdrop of decelerating growth.\"", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snap Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwriting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Underwriting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price\u2013earnings_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price\u2013earnings ratio"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--85dBjtZy--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/one-cms/core/2024-04-25t062138z_2_lynxnpek3o07l_rtroptp_3_meta-platforms-results.jpg?itok=hufSGUnQ", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

While Doppelganger Tesla (TSLA) rode horrible misses on Tuesday to a double-digit rally, Meta Platforms (META), the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp and the Oculus, produced impressive beats above Wall Street consensus after the close on Wednesday, only to watch the share price collapse by nearly 10%.\n\nThe market instead ignored Meta's successful quarter in favor of negativity surrounding the firm's Q2 sales guidance. Management said that it expected Q2 revenue in a range with a midpoint at $37.75 billion, while Wall Street's consensus had been calling for $38.3 billion. Additionally, the company expected higher legal and infrastructure costs for the full year.\n\nMeta shed a little more than 1% heading into its earnings call on Wednesday. Stock markets were flat to mixed overall on the day.\n\nIn the 18-odd months since META stock reached a floor near $88 in November 2022, the social media megalith has rallied by more than $1.08 trillion. That's a 450% gain, owing to CEO Mark Zuckerberg's pivot away from the metaverse toward the Reels short video app.\n\nBut that long rally may have come to an end with the Q1 release. If anything, the market seemed annoyed that Meta raised its capex guidance from the wide $30 to $37 billion range it had supplied earlier to between $35 to $40 billion. Zuckerberg and company did not supply an outlook for 2025 capex but told investors to expect it to increase.\n\nAs one of the largest capex companies in the S&P 500, Meta supplied 3%, or $27 billion, of total capex among that index's companies in 2023.\n\n\"The new version of Meta AI with Llama 3 is another step toward building the world's leading AI,\" Zuckerberg said in the earnings statement. \"We're seeing healthy growth across our apps, and we continue making steady progress building the metaverse as well.\"\n\nThe first quarter of 2024 was yet another capable performance by the main player in social media. Meta printed GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $4.71, which beat Wall Street's consensus by 39 cents.\n\nRevenue of $36.46 billion also surpassed the Street's expectation by nearly a quarter billion. Sales shot up more than 27% from a year ago.\n\nAdvertisement impressions increased by 20% from a year earlier, while the average price per ad rose 6% over that time period.\n\nDaily active users across its Family of Apps rose 7% from a year ago to 3.24 billion.\n\nThe primary bull target heading into earnings was the 161.8% Fibonacci level at $545. Above there sits the 261.8% Fibo at $584 as well. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been trending below the 50 threshold in the past few weeks, which tells us that momentum was declining heading into earnings. However, much of that decline may be attributed to the Israel-Iran hostilities and sticky inflation reports rather than META's intrinsic value.\n\nThe daily chart below shows that support sits in three places. First, there's the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $495, a level that Meta Platforms has been lately trading below. Then there's the 100-day SMA near $434. Below there, the $400 level comes into view, which is near where META was trading before it announced Q4 earnings back in February.", "source": {"uri": "fxstreet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FXStreet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Labs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reality Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Share price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_call", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earnings call"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_value_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intrinsic value (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_strength_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relative strength index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Equities/Industries/Software/pic-laptop-screen-637435355891636339_Large.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Mark Zuckerberg started the session with his confidence and ambitions of artificial intelligence, and then he slowly shifted his talk to the metaverse and puffed his company's operating system, its new headset, and smart glasses.\n\nWell, investors were looking for revenue generation, but they found ways how the cash will slip so Meta stock started falling and went as low as 19% yesterday, erasing a little more than $200 billion from the company's market cap. The stocks fell even though Meta beat expectations, however, investors wanted more, and the company did not live up to Wall Street's expectations.\n\nZuckerberg seemed to be expecting the dumping and recalled the metaverse-inflicted offloading and also investments in Reels and Stories. He said,\n\n\"I think it's worth calling that out, that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it.\"\n\nHe mentioned ads, but in plans for the future about how his company can incorporate them into the products that they are investing in now to generate revenues, despite the fact that Meta's revenue generation model is based on ad performance, and they get their 98% revenue from this same channel.\n\n2022 was a tough year for Meta, when metaverse spending and lighter revenues freaked investors out and it took a big bite out of the company's value. But last year, the company came back into Wall Street's good books again as it saw a three-fold increase in its stock and was 40% up this year, the highest it reached was $527 earlier this month.\n\nThe company's downsizing of its staff and closing of projects that were not important played a good role in gaining investors' confidence, which was part of Zuckerberg's cost-cutting strategy that he initiated at the start of 2023, when he announced it to be the \"year of efficiency.\" The CEO repeated that his efficiency policy will continue but will also shift resources to investments in AI.\n\nCapital expenditures forecast was increased by almost $3 billion to $5 billion, as they are now expected to be between $35 billion to $40 billion, which were previously expected to remain under $37 billion as the company is increasing its investment in infrastructure to facilitate its AI projects.\n\nZuckerberg told investors that they would have to be patient for better rewards. He mentioned their previous investments that proved good for the long term, he said that building AI on scale is also a larger undertaking, and it will take time but provide better returns in the end.", "source": {"uri": "cryptorank.io", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoRank"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality headset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

As some media pundits and economists speculate on TikTok's future, it's natural to wonder if competing social media platforms could benefit from a ban.\n\nLet's dig into what is going on from a legislative perspective, and assess why I see Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) as a big winner regardless of TikTok becoming banned in the U.S.\n\nIs TikTok banned in the U.S.?\n\nThere are a lot of details surrounding the so-called TikTok ban.\n\nFirst, on April 20 the House of Representatives passed a bill stipulating a ban of TikTok unless its parent company -- Chinese start-up ByteDance -- agrees to sell the asset to a U.S. business within the next year.\n\nNaturally, TikTok is employing hefty lobbying efforts to squash the bill. Given the rift between TikTok and U.S. lawmakers and the Senate's quick passage of the bill on April 23, it might seem like the company could be going away soon.\n\nHowever, there's more to unpack here. Now that Congress has passed the bill, President Biden will need to sign the bill into law and the company still has time to sell its business.\n\nSo, with all of that said, \"no,\" TikTok is not banned in the U.S., and although the bill landing on President Biden's desk so quickly could show urgency, there is no guarantee that the platform will be.\n\nNevertheless, Meta has a strong pulse in the social media realm. The company owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. According to data compiled by Semrush, Facebook and Instagram are the world's third and fourth most-visited websites, with WhatsApp rounding out the top 10.\n\nGiven Meta's dominant presence on the Internet, it's not surprising to learn that the company reaches nearly 4 billion people worldwide across its apps each month. It's this depth that has advertisers eager to broadcast across Meta's various platforms.\n\nHowever, what investors need to understand above all else is that advertising is a highly cyclical market.\n\nConsidering that TikTok has an estimated 1 billion active users worldwide -- and 150 million in the U.S. alone -- advertisers are surely keen to allocate some budget spend to the platform.\n\nTikTok's growth, both within and outside the U.S., threatens Meta. Although the company has a larger user base, the rising popularity of TikTok could spell trouble as advertisers move away from an overreliance on Meta's various platforms for additional channels, such as TikTok.\n\nIs Meta stock a buy now?\n\nBuying Meta stock based on the outcome of the TikTok bill is short-sighted. Should the bill be signed into law, many unknowns could still impact Meta.\n\nFor example, it's not clear who would bid to acquire TikTok. Moreover, it's not yet known what would be included in the sale as it pertains to intellectual property (IP). Given these variables, it's hard to assess what this could all mean for Meta.\n\nRather, the overarching theme here is that if TikTok were to be outright banned in the U.S., Meta would likely benefit by gobbling up advertising dollars that would otherwise have gone to competitors. While this theory warrants merit, it's still speculative and not yet a proven outcome.\n\nInstead, I'd encourage investors to consider Meta's investment prospects for reasons beyond TikTok. For starters, the company recently declared a dividend and increased its share buyback program by $50 billion.\n\nMoreover, Meta has been clear about its ambitions related to artificial intelligence (AI). The company is developing its own chips to complement existing data insights gathered from its various social platforms.\n\nTo me, Meta is a compelling opportunity regardless of a TikTok ban. In fact, a contrarian might suggest that the rising popularity of TikTok in the U.S. could end up being a long-term benefit for Meta, as increased competition often breeds new innovation.\n\nWhile I think the chatter surrounding TikTok is worth monitoring, I wouldn't base an investment decision purely on this news. For now, I see the idea of a TikTok ban as more of a clickbait headline-grabber.\n\nInvesting in Meta should be rooted in the company's financial position and its ability to execute its innovation roadmap -- with or without TikTok in the picture.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

However, a recent delay in Fed rate cuts and uncertainty in the chip sector have weighed on the Nasdaq over the past month.\n\nNow, with the start of the quarterly earnings season, the spotlight shines brightly on Meta. The social media giant will face its financial test today after the closing bell. Analysts are anticipating strong results from Mark Zuckerberg's company, with revenue expected to reach $36.223 billion - a 26.5% year-over-year increase, marking the highest growth rate since 2021.\n\nEarnings per share are also projected to nearly double compared to Q1 2023, jumping from $2.20 to $4.36. So, can Meta deliver on these high expectations and reignite the momentum for the tech sector, or will the company fall short and put Nasdaq's recent rebound under pressure?\n\nAnalysts are sharply raising their forecasts for Meta Platforms, with InvestingPro's chart showing a 59.8% increase in EPS expectations over the past year. This bullish sentiment has likely been fueled by Meta's:\n\nWhile strengths like advertising revenue growth fueled by new ad formats and advancements in AI with the launch of Meta AI promise a more engaging user experience on WhatsApp and Instagram, uncertainties remain.\n\nThe company's ambitious Metaverse project could lead to a second consecutive quarter of hefty losses exceeding $4 billion. Additionally, the upcoming US Presidential election poses a major challenge, potentially damaging Meta's credibility as concerns rise about the spread of misinformation on social media platforms.\n\nInvesting.com Analyst Sees Strengths Despite Metaverse Risks\n\nAccording to Thomas Monteiro, lead analyst at Investing.com:\n\n\"Thanks to its leaner margins and substantial free cash flows, Meta's ability to navigate the shifting interest rate narrative should be the key differentiator from its competitors this earnings season. This is particularly reassuring for investors in the current climate, where future guidance is the primary metric of interest, given the expectation of a tougher Q2.\"\n\nHe went on to add:\n\n\"The positive trend will likely get further push from the stronger-than-expected economic activity in the US and China for the period, which should once again serve as a solid catalyst for Meta's thriving ad operation. Against this backdrop, Meta's strong balance sheet, undisputed moat, and lean operation should also be perceived as a significant edge in the current war for talent, particularly in the AI space.\"\n\nHowever, Monteiro acknowledged that risks still lurk for the company ahead of the earnings report.\n\n\"Concurrently, the risk for this report lies in the company's need to show investors it is drawing closer to a scenario in which it will be able to draw substantial AI-generated revenues. Another interesting point is understanding whether a learner Metaverse operation can pay out in the mid-term. I would not be surprised by better-than-expected numbers there, but given the most recent US consumer trends, risks are still high.\"\n\nHe concluded:\n\n\"The bonus in the report would be if Zuckerberg could show investors his company is on the way to improving monetization in the WhatsApp business, which still presents significant untapped potential.\"\n\nWall Street Remains Bullish\n\nAnalysts are showering Meta Platforms with confidence ahead of its earnings release. A survey by InvestingPro of 53 analysts projects an average stock price increase of 9.16% over the next 12 months, setting a bullish target price of $541.20.\n\nThis optimism is reflected in analyst ratings, with 51 experts recommending \"Buy\" for Meta, 7 recommending \"Hold,\" and only 2 suggesting \"Sell.\" The market clearly has high hopes for Meta, following its impressive 140% stock price growth in the past year after a challenging 2022.\n\nHowever, with great power comes great responsibility. The social media giant now faces the pressure of exceeding expectations and not disappointing the markets and investors who believe in its bullish potential.\n\nTake advantage of a special discount to subscribe to InvestingPro+ and take advantage of all our tools to optimize your investment strategy.

As such, shares are entering the 'penalty box,'\" Baird Equity Research analysts said.\n\nMeta forecast April-June revenue below estimates and raised the bottom end of its 2024 total expense forecast by $2 billion on Wednesday. It also raised the top end of its capital expenditure view as it invests in data centers essential to its efforts to catch up with AI frontrunners OpenAI and Microsoft.\n\nThe dour expectations follow a series of smash-hit earnings that helped Meta nearly triple its stock in 2023 and powered the biggest one-day market value gain by any company in Wall Street history, of $196 billion, in February after its maiden dividend.\n\nStill, several analysts were positive on the investments, pointing to AI-driven engagement on content such as Instagram Reels and the warm reception for its virtual assistant Meta AI and early versions of its latest large language model, Llama 3.\n\n\"We think this time it is different,\" Evercore ISI analysts said. \"This investment cycle comes from a position of strength, as management continues to see a healthy ad demand environment into Q2 and improving user engagement.\"\n\nOverall, 19 analysts lowered their price targets on the stock, while 13 raised their view, according to LSEG data. The median price target now stands at $525, which is about 6% higher than its previous close.\n\nThe stock has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 23.12, compared with Microsoft's 31.17 and Alphabet's 22.07. It has gained nearly 40% so far this year, comfortably above the benchmark S&P 500 index's 6% gain.\n\n\"Being on the offensive with investment spending is generally great, but in internet it is very hard to underwrite which of those investments will pay back and when,\" Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik said.\n\n\"All of this culminates with investors wondering just how long this investment cycle will last, whether the opportunity and payback is real, all against a backdrop of decelerating growth.\"\n\n(Reporting by Siddarth S and Kanchana Chakravarty in Bengaluru and Amanda Cooper in London; additional reporting by Johann M Cherian; Editing by Alun John, Janane Venkatraman and Anil D'Silva)", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

This is a rare opportunity for folks like us. It means we can experiment with AI technologies and build our own applications without being plugged into the cloud.\n\nHowever, most of what Meta is doing around AI involves their ubiquitous suit of apps. Their assistant Meta AI is entirely free to use and is slowly being included in all places where you keep in touch with your loved ones. So, Instagram now has an AI bot in its search bar. This feels slightly bolted on at the moment, but I imagine it will become more integrated. Even though Meta AI is available to everyone, the bumper features (like image generation) are only for people with a Facebook account.\n\nTo hear 'Zuck' talk like he is not one of the big evil tech guys he seems to dislike so much, check out the Dwarkesh Patel podcast on YouTube. It feels like Meta has read the room and understands that they can clear the very low bar of morality in this new wave of tech without doing too much. 'Zuck' is emerging as the tech world's tallest dwarf.\n\n'Zuck' insists on calling Llama 3 \"open source\" because it is a term people associate with ye olde Internet of good, free and fair. However, it technically isn't open source. It is \"open weight\" which is fundamentally different and not as rosy.\n\nIf your model is open source then you make available the full training source code and the dataset required for retraining the model from scratch. This includes the model architecture code, training methodology and the original training dataset.\n\nRead more in Daily Maverick: Meta Debuts Llama 3, Latest AI Model for Training Chatbots\n\nMeta has not included these crucial parts. However, it has published \"the weights and the inference code\". In brief: weights are the \"knowledge\" the model has gained from the training data (so one step away from the \"source\") and the inference code is the set of instructions that uses the knowledge to make predictions or classify data.\n\nThey are claiming that Llama-3 will be tremendous for the open-weight community. And, to be fair, Llama-2 already has an ecosystem where dozens of decent open-weight models are released each week on HuggingFace. People are building chatbots, translation models and assistants for research. They can customise this model more than others and it's free. Let's be clear: at this point, Meta knows it doesn't have to do this and they want us to be grateful.\n\nWhat's fascinating, when it comes to more day-to-day use, is how Meta AI stacks up against its rivals. They are adding real-time AI image generation to WhatsApp -- if you were worried about visual disinformation on the platform before, it is about to go stratospheric. And when it comes to coding, the new platform absolutely stinks. When asked to write a WordPress plugin, rewrite a string function, find an annoying bug and write a script it is clear which assistant you need to keep using. ChatGPT nailed all four tasks and Meta AI only succeeded at finding the bug.\n\nThe strangest part of this is we are well into year two of the AI explosion and only now Meta is showing its hand. But regardless of its functionality right now they have the user base to accelerate its capacity like no other. Though, I am serious when it comes to disinformation: these integrations mean everything you see on social media is about to be way more dubious than ever before.\n\nOpenAI's Custom GPT Store made a huge splash when it arrived. It promised the chance for you to knock together your own GPT (using their built-in tools) and then sell what you created to other users. The financial side has not entirely materialised, but there are plenty of gems if you have the time to sift through the rubbish. We should all be happy for this post on Medium where they have done extensive work in assessing the tools available for content creation. Here are a few highlights:\n\nI'm not sure if this is good or bad news. Profluent just developed OpenCRISPR-1, the world's first open-source AI-powered gene editor. It says it is capable of editing the human genome and uses LLM tech to produce new proteins. According to the website it promises to: \"bypass the random process of evolution and move us towards intentionally designing proteins for a specific purpose\". CEO Ali Madani said there is a future where AI \"precisely designs what is needed to create a range of bespoke cures for disease\". But they also cite Botox as an example of a \"transformative protein in our society\" so who knows what is going on.\n\nMeta AI refused to create an image for the prompt \"create an image for the article 'With AI will Facebook finally improve the world?'\" After testing a bunch of variations of the prompt I discovered that it wasn't \"AI\" or \"Facebook\" that it was baulking at, but that I was producing an image for an \"article\".

The big pullback in the stock price came after the company released its first-quarter earnings report.\n\nInterestingly, the social media specialist's report actually included some pretty upbeat data about Q1 itself. Revenue and earnings per share (EPS), for instance, were both ahead of analysts' average forecasts for the two metrics. So why did the stock fall?\n\nProbably because of Meta's guidance. Not only did it say it's now expecting to spend more on capital expenditures during 2024 than it previously anticipated, but its second-quarter revenue guidance implies a significant deceleration in its year-over-year growth rate.\n\nMeta's first-quarter financial performance was quite impressive. Total revenue rose 27% year over year to $36.5 billion, beating analysts' consensus forecast for about $36.2 billion.\n\nThis top-line performance put the figure at the high end of management's guidance for the period for revenue between $34.5 and $37 billion. Further, this marked an acceleration from the 25% year-over-year revenue growth Meta reported in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nSuch strong sales growth, combined with benefits from the company's increasing focus on efficiency, unsurprisingly led to significant operating margin expansion and, ultimately, a more than doubling in earnings per share. Meta's operating margin expanded from 25% in the year-ago quarter to 38%, while earnings per share rose 114% to $4.71.\n\nThis performance was fueled by healthy user metrics, including a 7% year-over-year increase in daily users across its platforms, a 20% jump in ad impressions, and a 6% boost in average price per ad.\n\nThese strong results put cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of the period at about $58 billion, even as Meta spent approximately $14.6 billion buying back its stock and paid out $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders.\n\nConsidering Meta's incredible first-quarter results, the company's guidance for a slowdown is a bit surprising. Management's outlook for second-quarter revenue of between $36.5 billion and $39 billion implies 18% year-over-year growth -- a dramatic deceleration from the 27% growth the company reported in Q1.\n\nSuch a significant expected pullback in its top-line year-over-year growth rate may cause some investors to worry. They might be asking: Could growth slow even more in the coming quarters?\n\nThis is particularly concerning in a high-interest-rate environment like the ones consumers are in today. Investors are looking for clues as to whether or not this will negatively impact consumers to the point that advertisers start being more judicious about their marketing budgets.\n\nAnother reason Meta investors may be disappointed is the company increased its outlook for capital expenditures for the full year. Management said it now expects to spend between $35 billion and $40 billion, up from a previous forecast for $30 billion to $37 billion. This increase is due to a continued acceleration of Meta's infrastructure investments to support its artificial intelligence (AI) product development, said Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li in the company's first-quarter earnings report.\n\nSlowing growth combined with higher-than-expected capital expenditures are definitely good reasons for investors to be incrementally cautious.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_sparks@fool.com", "name": "Daniel Sparks", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Acceleration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operating margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital expenditure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/774246/meta-stock-down.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

For Reality Labs, we continue to expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and our investments to further scale our ecosystem.\n\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35-40 billion, increased from our prior range of $30-37 billion as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap. While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts.\n\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full-year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens.\n\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\n\nQ1 was a good start to the year. We're seeing strong momentum within our Family of Apps and are making important progress on our longer-term AI and Reality Labs initiatives that have the potential to transform the way people interact with our services over the coming years.\n\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\n\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 2, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is April 24, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\n\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\n\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\n\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\n\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\n\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n\n(In millions,

Here's What That Means for Meta Stock. | The Motley Fool", "body": "Meta is working on something that's more immediately material to the business than what happens to TikTok.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Saturday that's not good for popular social-media app TikTok. But it may have gone unnoticed by many investors because it was packaged inside of a foreign aid bill for Ukraine and Israel. Because of the bill, TikTok's parent company is faced with the choice of selling its popular app in the U.S. or pulling it from the U.S. market entirely.\n\nFacebook's parent company Meta Platforms (META 2.98%) is seen as a clear beneficiary of the TikTok legislation. I'll explain why that's the case but I'll also explain why Meta investors might want to tap the brakes on their enthusiasm.\n\nI've noted that the TikTok bill made it through the House of Representatives but this doesn't mean it's now a done deal. The bill still has to make it through the Senate. And after that, it has to be signed by President Biden.\n\nGranted, there's bipartisan support for the bill and it passed the House of Representatives with ease. Therefore, it's reasonable to expect it to pass the Senate. From there, comments from President Biden make it sound like he will indeed sign it.\n\nHowever, even if the bill is signed by the president, TikTok wouldn't be in immediate danger of disappearing. Parent company ByteDance would have up to a year to become compliant with the law. By then, it's possible Biden would no longer be the president, suddenly pushing U.S. policy in another direction. Therefore, ByteDance might stall for time.\n\nFinally, ByteDance could sell TikTok. And if it does, the app might not ever leave the U.S. market, leaving the competitive landscape unchanged. This possibility is quite realistic. For example, former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin is already assembling a team of investors to buy TikTok if it goes up for sale.\n\nIn summary, Meta Platforms' shareholders shouldn't celebrate yet. The bill hasn't completely passed yet, ByteDance will have about a year to weigh its options, and TikTok may never disappear in the U.S. anyway if it's sold to a party that can keep it running.\n\nThe company sells hardware products, is pushing research in artificial intelligence (AI), and has big plans for the metaverse. But in 2023, 98% of Meta's revenue came from digital advertising. Therefore, advertising is clearly the most important thing for Meta investors to watch.\n\nDigital advertising depends on user engagement. It doesn't matter how many users a platform technically has. What matters is whether they are using the platform and can be shown an ad. And for Meta, video is a key component of user engagement.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, video watch time for Meta was up a whopping 25% year over year, which shows how quickly user engagement is growing.\n\nIn the Q4 conference call, Meta's CFO Susan Li said that video has lower levels of monetization right now. That's why the company is doing what it can to increase engagement. Regardless of what happens with TikTok, Meta is busy building its AI engine for recommending videos to viewers, which can boost engagement if done well. Given the 25% growth in Q4, there's reason to believe that Meta's AI engine is off to a good start.\n\nHowever, it stands to reason that Meta would additionally benefit if TikTok did disappear from the market. Advertisers spend money on the popular platform. But if it were banned, those dollars would flow elsewhere. And some of that spend would logically wind up with Meta.\n\nIn conclusion, the TikTok bill that just passed in the House of Representatives doesn't mean anything for Meta stock right now and it's possible that it never does. Therefore, Meta investors need to focus on what the company is doing regardless of what happens with TikTok.\n\nThat said, if things with TikTok play out a certain way, then it could eventually give Meta's business a boost. Therefore, it's not entirely immaterial to investors today and it's worth monitoring.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_quast@fool.com", "name": "Jon Quast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ByteDance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ByteDance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Mnuchin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steven Mnuchin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holding_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holding company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/773986/meta.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

(NASDAQ: NASDAQ:META) stock, reducing the price target to $500 from the previous $540, while reaffirming a Buy rating on the stock.\n\nThe adjustment follows Meta's announcement of entering a significant investment cycle, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI), which is anticipated to increase capital expenditures substantially for an extended period.\n\nThe bank's analysis suggests that although Meta's stock experienced a more than 15% decline in after-hours trading, the company's history of investment cycles has traditionally benefited its long-term equity value. This cycle is characterized by larger AI investments than previously forecasted, leading to a roughly 10% reduction in free cash flow estimates for FY25.\n\nMeta is currently expanding its services beyond its traditional advertising model, unlike past transitions that followed industry trends and temporarily cannibalized more profitable segments.\n\nThe company's Family of Apps (FoA) business remains robust, with AI-driven engagement growth and enhanced ad platform performance. Deutsche Bank highlights Meta's position as the fastest-growing ad platform at scale, entering the AI space from a position of strength.\n\nCritics may argue that Meta is overextending by investing in both Reality Labs (RL) and AI. Nevertheless, the company has pointed out synergies between RL and other segments, with AI integration in new hardware such as Ray Ban Sunglasses serving as a recent example. Deutsche Bank emphasizes Meta's disciplined spending history and the potential for high returns on these investments.\n\nWith Meta's stock valuation appearing more reasonable following the recent pullback, and considering the company's strong track record of shareholder returns and a competitive advertising platform, Deutsche Bank advises viewing Meta's increasing AI investments as a positive move for the company's future.\n\nAs Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) embarks on a significant investment cycle in artificial intelligence, the company's financial health and market performance offer valuable insights. According to InvestingPro data, Meta holds a substantial market cap of 1250.0 billion USD, and its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at a relatively high 32.46, with an adjusted P/E ratio of 29.8 for the last twelve months as of Q4 2023.

Parsing the company's language on capex, the color from CFO Li on next year's increase in spending says the company will \"invest aggressively\" to support \"ambitious\" AI research and product development.\n\nStill, the market is not impressed - it vividly recalls how much money the company burned on the catastrophic metaverse dead end - and as Bloomberg notes, ever since Meta's rollout for its expensive metaverse/virtual reality plans, investors have been laser-focused on expenses and how quickly those will pay off. With AI, the company appears to have a longer grace period since it's an industrywide bet, but even that will soon come under scrutiny for Meta, seeing as its expected capex is ticking up now for the year.\n\nAnd sure enough, the advertising-funded social network could not wait to turn the attention to AI, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg's quote in the earnings release, citing its new large language model (Llama 3) just released:\n\n\"The new version of Meta AI with Llama 3 is another step towards building the world's leading AI. We're seeing healthy growth across our apps and we continue making steady progress building the metaverse as well.\"\n\nTurning to the company's actual metrics, the total number of people using Meta's apps (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads) rose 7% year-over-year to 3.24 billion.\n\nThat's the only user metric we're getting from Meta, which said last quarter it would stop consistent reporting of MAUs and app-level metrics.\n\nTurning to revenue, ad revenue dropped sequentially as it always does in Q1 but rose YoY...\n\n... with Average Revenue per User dropping but higher than a year ago.\n\n... as the average price per ad rose significantly in Q1.\n\nMeanwhile, even as ad revenue dipped, expenses as a % of revenues are once again rising.\n\nPutting it all together, and taking a quick look at the stock price, we can conclude that the market is not impressed, as META shares are tumbling 13%, wiping out some $135BN in market cap...\n\n... on pace for their worst drop since Oct 2022 and vaporizing all gains since the last earnings report.\n\n... as we officially enter the \"show me the monAI\" phase and as focus among investors right now is on spending \"and the fact that they're raising capex guidance by 10%\" according to Bloomberg tech analyst Mandeep Singh, who adds that \"investors are fearful. Whenever this company talks about spending more, the alarm bells start ringing.\"\n\nThe plunge in META stock is weighing on the Nasdaq and other social media stocks post-market. Shares of Snap are down 3.3%, while Pinterest has shed nearly 4%. Reddit is down 1.3%.\n\nThe company's earnings presentation is below (pdf link)", "source": {"uri": "ugebrev.dk", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u00d8konomisk Ugebrev"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Capital expenditure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snap Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandeep_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mandeep Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinterest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pinterest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://ugebrev.dk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/metaverse.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nMeta Platforms has had a winning year so far, with the stock up 40% and sentiment upbeat ahead of its first-quarter report on Wednesday.\n\nThe firm has benefited strongly from rising enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, while Wall Street has highlighted the the company's ad strength, with expected spending momentum set to boost results.\n\nHere's what Wall Street expects from Meta's first-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday:\n\nWells Fargo has projected ad-led strength in the first-quarter, with Meta benefiting from a robust e-commerce environment.\n\nFor this reason, the bank modestly boosted the firm's revenue growth forecast to above consensus levels, though it expects the trend to moderate in the second quarter. By then, the market will be on the lookout for another product-cycle catalyst to keep ad momentum up.\n\n\"See sustainable multiple expansion driven by clear engagement and product catalysts to support the next leg of META share growth, as positive revision cycle driven by macro tailwinds moderates. We view WhatsApp as an under-appreciated asset w/ sizable potential, should Meta invoke more direct monetization beyond Click-to-Message ads,\" analysts led by Ken Gawrelski said.\n\nWells Fargo rates Meta at \"Overweight\" with a $600 price target.\n\nRBC sees more strength ahead for Meta as ad volume growth outpaces peers.\n\nFor instance, the bank noted that Instagram Reels ads have continued ramping up, increasing 22% from January's 16.4%. That's while competitors such as TikTok have watched ad loads decline.\n\nWith sentiment staying strong, RBC also expects mid-teen growth to look achievable if second-quarter earnings expectations are met.\n\n\"META is well-appreciated & well-owned, however, solid engagement trends, industry-leading marginal conversion, new ad units and a growing moat still offer very attractive characteristics of an earnings compounder returning capital with open-ended AI optionality, (particularly compute capacity optionality which we think is underappreciated),\" analysts led by Brad Erickson wrote last Thursday.\n\nSome pullback could occur in the first half of the year given China's economic slowdown, which could impact ad spending.\n\nRBC rates Meta at \"Outperform\" with a $600 price target.\n\nGoldman expects digital advertising to stay strong in the forward twelve months, boosting its first-quarter outlook on Meta.\n\nThe sentiment comes as ad dollars shift into digital channels, and digital platform products -- such as short-form videos -- continue to improve. The bank highlighted the fact that Instagram Reels has reached revenue neutrality, and should remain a key revenue growth tailwind over the coming years.\n\n\"We remain constructive on META long term but recognize that there may be less identifiable catalysts with this earnings report when compared to the heightened investor debates (especially on the topic of rate of revenue deceleration),\"\n\nGoldman Sachs rates Meta at \"Buy\" and holds a 12-month price target of $555.\n\nBank of America is betting on first-quarter upside from higher ad spending, driven up by seasonal events, such as the Leap Year and Easter.\n\nIn a note last week, the bank also emphasized that Meta is still in the first inning of an AI-led monetization cycle, and thinks that the firm's AI assets are underappreciated by its market price.\n\n\"We remain positive on Meta and reiterate our thesis that Reels, Messaging, and AI driven ad improvements are still early, and could lead to positive product surprises & revenue momentum in 2024,\" analysts Justin Post and Nitin Bansal said.\n\nDown the road, Meta could also be the leading winner from TikTok limitations, they said, with a ban on the app moving forward in Washington.\n\nBank of America rates Meta at \"Buy\" with a $550 price target.\n\nAlthough Meta remains a top idea among JPMorgan analysts, they highlighted concern about cooling growth prospects after the first quarter.\n\n\"META remains well-owned, but there is growing caution into earnings on almost-certain growth deceleration beyond 1Q due to tough comps & perception of lack of new drivers vs. '23. We believe slower growth is well-anticipated, & likely taken into account in META's undemanding multiple,\" analysts led by Doug Anmuth wrote last week.\n\nAmong positive first-quarter developments the bank is eyeing is Meta's implementation of AI in its ad stack, which JPMorgan sees as a significant contributor to growth and makes the firm an AI leader.\n\nStill, this year's ad growth drivers are little changed from 2023, and deceleration won't come as a surprise among investors: \"We believe META can exit the year growing in the mid-teens% (we model +13%).\"\n\nJPMorgan rates Meta at \"Overweight\" with a $535 price target.", "source": {"uri": "markets.businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Markets Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "filip_de_mott@markets.businessinsider.com", "name": "Filip De Mott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Momentum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Macro (computer science)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terms of service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acceleration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Easter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JPMorgan Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/6628095510dfcda409625ba4?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

(META) is the world's largest social media network, with more than 4 billion monthly active users as of Q4. The company's portfolio of apps includes Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, and Messenger. It helps people connect with their contacts all around the globe through the use of features such as messaging, sharing photos and videos, video calling, and more. Formerly known as Facebook, Meta changed its name back in 2021 to reflect its shifting focus toward metaverse and artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\n\nWhen Meta released its Q4 results back on Feb. 1 of this year, it posted a revenue gain of 24.7% to $40.11 billion, and diluted EPS surged to $5.33 from $1.76 in the same quarter last year. Ad impressions increased 21% YoY, while the average price per ad decreased 9% YoY.\n\nFor Q1 of 2024, Meta forecast revenue of $35.75 billion at the midpoint, which exceeded Wall Street's forecast.\n\nMeta is set to announce its Q1 earnings after the close this Wednesday, April 24, with analysts targeting a profit of $4.32 per share - up 63% YoY. The company has beat bottom-line estimates in each of its last four quarterly reports.\n\nIs Meta Stock a Buy?\n\nMeta is well-loved by analysts, and has a consensus \"Strong Buy\" rating among the 45 brokerage firms in coverage. The mean price target is $520.73, which indicates expected upside potential of 8.7% from current levels.\n\nLast week, Citi raised its price target for the tech giant, noting that increasing advertisement load on its Reels video posts hasn't been a negative for engagement - a major positive for Meta right now, particularly as its primary Reels competitor, TikTok, faces a potential ban from legislators.\n\nCiti analyst Ronald Josey wrote that Instagram Reels saw an ad load increase of 90 basis points from the previous quarter, but users were undeterred, with average minutes per daily active user up 4% over the same period. Additionally, the analyst observed that 79% of Gen Z users went on to purchase a product after viewing a Reel on the platform.\n\nThe Citi analyst is bullish on the Reels effect for Meta, and now projects 14% revenue growth for 2025, alongside an EPS forecast of $24.23.

Those endeavours have been pricey.\n\nReality Labs, the division inside Meta that is spearheading these efforts, lost US$16 billion in 2023.

And that opens up a lot of additional opportunities beyond just ones that are the most obvious ones for us.\"\n\nAchieving that vision will be expensive.

As some media pundits and economists speculate on TikTok's future, it's natural to wonder if competing social media platforms could benefit from a ban.\n\nLet's dig into what is going on from a legislative perspective, and assess why I see Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) as a big winner regardless of TikTok becoming banned in the U.S.\n\nThere are a lot of details surrounding the so-called TikTok ban.\n\nFirst, on April 20 the House of Representatives passed a bill stipulating a ban of TikTok unless its parent company -- Chinese start-up ByteDance -- agrees to sell the asset to a U.S. business within the next year.\n\nNaturally, TikTok is employing hefty lobbying efforts to squash the bill. Given the rift between TikTok and U.S. lawmakers and the Senate's quick passage of the bill on April 23, it might seem like the company could be going away soon.\n\nHowever, there's more to unpack here. Now that Congress has passed the bill, President Biden will need to sign the bill into law and the company still has time to sell its business.\n\nSo, with all of that said, \"no,\" TikTok is not banned in the U.S., and although the bill landing on President Biden's desk so quickly could show urgency, there is no guarantee that the platform will be.\n\nThe social media landscape is ripe with competition. Alphabet owns video-sharing platform YouTube -- which is the world's second-most visited website. Furthermore, applications from Snap and Pinterest are highly popular among Millennials and Gen Z demographics.\n\nNevertheless, Meta has a strong pulse in the social media realm. The company owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. According to data compiled by Semrush, Facebook and Instagram are the world's third and fourth most-visited websites, with WhatsApp rounding out the top 10.\n\nGiven Meta's dominant presence on the Internet, it's not surprising to learn that the company reaches nearly 4 billion people worldwide across its apps each month. It's this depth that has advertisers eager to broadcast across Meta's various platforms.\n\nHowever, what investors need to understand above all else is that advertising is a highly cyclical market.\n\nConsidering that TikTok has an estimated 1 billion active users worldwide -- and 150 million in the U.S. alone -- advertisers are surely keen to allocate some budget spend to the platform.\n\nTikTok's growth, both within and outside the U.S., threatens Meta. Although the company has a larger user base, the rising popularity of TikTok could spell trouble as advertisers move away from an overreliance on Meta's various platforms for additional channels, such as TikTok.\n\nBuying Meta stock based on the outcome of the TikTok bill is short-sighted. Should the bill be signed into law, many unknowns could still impact Meta.\n\nFor example, it's not clear who would bid to acquire TikTok. Moreover, it's not yet known what would be included in the sale as it pertains to intellectual property (IP). Given these variables, it's hard to assess what this could all mean for Meta.\n\nRather, the overarching theme here is that if TikTok were to be outright banned in the U.S., Meta would likely benefit by gobbling up advertising dollars that would otherwise have gone to competitors. While this theory warrants merit, it's still speculative and not yet a proven outcome.\n\nInstead, I'd encourage investors to consider Meta's investment prospects for reasons beyond TikTok. For starters, the company recently declared a dividend and increased its share buyback program by $50 billion.\n\nMoreover, Meta has been clear about its ambitions related to artificial intelligence (AI). The company is developing its own chips to complement existing data insights gathered from its various social platforms.\n\nTo me, Meta is a compelling opportunity regardless of a TikTok ban. In fact, a contrarian might suggest that the rising popularity of TikTok in the U.S. could end up being a long-term benefit for Meta, as increased competition often breeds new innovation.\n\nWhile I think the chatter surrounding TikTok is worth monitoring, I wouldn't base an investment decision purely on this news. For now, I see the idea of a TikTok ban as more of a clickbait headline-grabber.\n\nInvesting in Meta should be rooted in the company's financial position and its ability to execute its innovation roadmap -- with or without TikTok in the picture.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

(NASDAQ: NASDAQ:META), reducing it to $500 from the previous $555, while maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. The revision follows Meta's first-quarter earnings report for 2024, which showed robust revenue trends and a strong operating margin in its core Family of Apps segment. The company also reported approximately $16 billion in capital returns through share buybacks and dividends.\n\nMeta Platforms began the year with a positive first-quarter performance, overcoming a challenging year-over-year comparison. Despite this, the company's forward-looking statements indicated a slowdown in revenue growth for the second quarter, set against increasingly difficult year-over-year comparisons. Additionally, Meta announced plans to increase investments, which in turn led to higher guidance for total GAAP expenses and capital expenditures for the fiscal year 2024.\n\nThe increased investment cycle is expected to impact the company's multi-year operating expenses and capital expenditure trajectory. Although Meta did not provide quantitative details beyond 2024, management's discussion of past investment and product cycles, such as Stories and Reels, suggests that the company is preparing for significant, ongoing investments.\n\nGoldman Sachs noted that Meta's history of navigating investment cycles successfully positions the platform for long-term success amid shifts in products and computing. Despite the likelihood of share volatility in the upcoming quarters, particularly if increased investments coincide with downward revenue revisions, the firm highlighted the substantial level of share buybacks in the first quarter.\n\nThis buyback activity is seen as a mitigating factor against a steeper drop in forward earnings per share estimates, potentially supporting the stock's valuation metrics moving forward.\n\nAs Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) navigates through its investment cycles and market expectations, insights from InvestingPro provide a deeper look into the company's financial health and market positioning. Holding more cash than debt on its balance sheet, Meta shows a strong liquidity position which is essential for its increased investment plans. Analysts have taken note of Meta's strategic moves, with 11 analysts revising their earnings upwards for the upcoming period, reflecting optimism in the company's ability to manage growth and profitability.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, despite Meta trading at a high earnings multiple with a P/E Ratio of 32.46, the company's PEG Ratio of 0.44 indicates that its price may be reasonable relative to its near-term earnings growth. Additionally, the strong return over the last year, with a Year-to-Date Price Total Return of 39.57%, showcases the market's confidence in Meta's performance.\n\nInvestors looking for more insights can find additional InvestingPro Tips for Meta, which include analysis on metrics such as revenue valuation multiples and the ability to cover interest payments with cash flows.

The investor reaction on Wednesday indicated deepening concerns.\n\nIn a research note on Monday about Alphabet, analysts from New Street Research said the potential for materially higher capital expenditures was a worry ahead of results on Thursday.\n\nThe research firm said it now expects Alphabet's full-year capital expenditures to be $45.9 billion, up from its previous estimate of $42.7 billion.\n\nMicrosoft has positioned itself to be a winner in AI due to its partnership with OpenAI, which kicked off the generative AI craze last year with ChatGPT, said analysts from Jefferies in a note on March 31\n\nGoogle has been working to catch up in the generative AI race and released Gemini, a model that can understand and create different types of information including text, audio and video.\n\nCreating content with generative AI is energy-intensive, and Zuckerberg cited the cost as a reason for Meta's higher expenses.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft has positioned itself to be a winner in AI due to its partnership with OpenAI, which kicked off the generative AI craze last year with ChatGPT, said analysts from Jefferies in a note on March 31.\n\nREAD MORE: Alphabet lays off hundreds from global recruitment team\n\nMicrosoft has integrated chatbots into its suite of Office products and is planning to invest more in data centers.\n\nIndustry-wide, shareholders are now focused on looking for revenue, including pricing models and whether customers can find use cases that justify the cost of generative AI, Jefferies wrote.\n\n\"Last year was spent dreaming of gen AI's potential,\" the analysts wrote. \"This year will be about moving forward with concrete steps.\"", "source": {"uri": "chinadailyasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "China Daily Asia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics/Fonts", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics/Fonts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.chinadailyhk.com/upload/main/image/2024/04/25/8a69b1196c5acb5355b58a3ff4a9f81e.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-31", "textStart": 2248, "textEnd": 2256, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

On Tuesday, the bill cleared the Senate, 79-18, and now heads to the desk of President Joe Biden, who has said he will sign it.\n\nThe bill gives TikTok parent ByteDance up to one year to sell its stake in the popular social media platform.\n\n\"The motivations [for the TikTok bank] are around concerns that China could misuse American user data,\" says Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. While the broader ramifications for the tech sector are unknown, Streeter says that the passage of this bill is \"a clear signal of the U.S.' willingness to crack down on big tech, when it's deemed unsafe.\"\n\nStreeter adds that the impact for other social media platforms are likely limited because this is more a political move. \"That said, it's still something the likes of Meta will be keenly monitoring,\" she notes. \"Although the bill is progressing, nothing is set in stone - TikTok is likely to mount a legal challenge to the ruling.\"\n\nIndeed, while Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, initially jumped on the news, it quickly erased these early gains ahead of the company's first-quarter earnings report, which is due after Wednesday's market close.\n\nThe event is one of the most anticipated on this week's earnings calendar.

He added that the firm thinks \"Meta's AI assets are underappreciated in the stock price with stock at 16 times core 2025 earnings per share.\"\n\nWedbush is also bullish on the communication services stock. In an April 11 report, the research firm reiterated its Buy rating and raising its price target to $570 from $520.\n\n\"We think the company is well positioned heading into Q1 results given positive feedback from advertisers in our survey work and healthy underlying demand trends with particular strength in the social vertical,\" Wedbush said. \"We are raising our estimates ahead of the Q1 report and now expect revenue in the quarter of $36.9 billion (+28.8% year-over-year), a roughly 3% increase from our prior estimate.\"\n\nAccording to S&P Global Market Intelligence, the consensus analyst target price for Meta stock is $541.20, representing implied upside of 10% to current levels.

Mark Zuckerberg's backers seem to have forgotten who he is. Meta Platforms, the company he started under the banner of moving fast and breaking things, lost 16%, or some $200 billion of market value, after indicating its second-quarter revenue would be lower than analysts were projecting and that this year's capital-expenditure bill would be higher than previously flagged. Maybe the inaugural dividend unveiled in February lulled investors into complacency, but the CEO's track record leaves little doubt about how he operates.\n\nFollowing the release of the quarterly results on Wednesday, Zuckerberg made clear where he is steering the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. He's more optimistic and more ambitious on artificial intelligence and wants to build the world's leading services in the field. The goal will require significant investment. Meta's 2024 forecast for capex, including on servers and other infrastructure, could reach $40 billion, more than the $37 billion it had signaled earlier. Zuckerberg and Chief Financial Officer Susan Li also noted the related projects probably will take \"several years.\" Finding ways to make money from them also is a work in progress.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, it is. Meta has been spending heaps of money to reinvent itself for years. It made the leap from PCs to smartphones, and keeps rolling out new services and features, including Reels and Stories, before diving whole hog into the metaverse. AI is already recommending half of what shows up on Instagram feeds. And although the upside of applying the technology to the company's primary revenue source, advertising, may be fuzzy, it's also quite promising.\n\nMeta's past sprees have sent investors scurrying before. In 2022, for example, right after Facebook rebranded itself as Meta, capex jumped to 27% of revenue, more than 10 percentage points higher than in the previous year. The company's stock price plummeted by nearly two-thirds before recovering, and then some.\n\nWith deep-pocketed rivals such as Alphabet, Amazon.com and Microsoft all gunning for AI supremacy, it's hard to see how anyone would think Zuckerberg might enter the race at half-speed.

It will post a cute picture of your cat on Instagram, even if you don't actually have a cat. And it will put some enhanced memories up for you on Facebook, while cheerfully making connections with people you don't know and who may well not actually exist... When Mark Zuckerberg started explaining his plans for Meta - the company formerly known as Facebook - to start investing billions of dollars in Artificial Intelligence (AI) yesterday, investors should have been cheering all the lucrative possibilities. Instead, the share price has promptly sunk like a stone. The stock market has started to become suspicious of the AI hype - and rightly so.\n\nThe best thing Zuckerberg could do when Meta's next batch of quarterly results are announced is call in sick. The company churns out vast profits from its social media empire, serving up precision-targeted advertising whenever any of us go online. But when it tries to diversify it all goes badly wrong.\n\nWhen Zuckerberg rebranded the company as Meta, and pumped billions into virtual reality, its shares sank like a stone. They only recovered as he scaled back his ambitions. Now it has happened all over again. Announcing quarterly profits, Zuckerberg outlined his ambitions to invest heavily in AI. The result? In after-hours trading, the shares plunged by 15 per cent, wiping billions from the value of the company.\n\nBut hold on. Surely AI is the technology of the future? It is so powerful that it is about to take over the planet and is the one sector everyone wants to get into. Meta's shares should have been soaring on its investment. Well, perhaps. And yet right now, there are also signs that the AI bubble is starting to bust. Shares in Nvidia, the company that makes the high-performance chips that power most AI systems, have fallen by 16 per cent over the last month. There are not many pure AI companies on the market, but if there were, their finances would be looking a lot shakier over the last few weeks.\n\nNo one would deny that AI is a significant technology. It has made huge strides in mimicking human intelligence, and it may well have lots of commercial potential, replacing millions of workers with smart chatbots and enabling lots of new products to be launched.\n\nThe trouble is, there are two huge problems. First, unlike websites which could be launched very cheaply (after all Zuckerberg started what was known as 'the facebook' from his college dorm), AI systems are incredibly expensive. The chips command high prices, in part because Nvidia has a lock on the market. The electricity bills will be daunting. One estimate last year was that by 2027, AI servers would use as much electricity as the whole of Sweden.\n\nMeanwhile, as competition becomes more intense, salary costs are going through the roof. Programmers can ask for whatever money they want. On top of that, many of the systems have to pay for copyrighted material to 'train' the software. Add it all up, and a chatbot is very, very expensive to run. There are already estimates that ChatGPT is costing $700,000 (\u00a3560,000) a day to operate, and that will only rise as the technology becomes more popular.\n\nAnd yet there is no guarantee there will be a profitable business at the end of it. Some of the main models have tried charging for access, but it remains to be seen whether they can make that stick. With so many rivals on the market, there will be lots of pressure to make the product free.\n\nAdvertising may well not ride to the rescue as it did in the early days of Facebook.

After a period of huge bullishness over generative AI, investors are starting to freak out about the massive costs involved, as evidenced by the reaction to Meta's earnings yesterday.\n\nTo be fair, there's more than one reason why the Facebook and Instagram parent's share price took a 15% dip in after-the-bell trading, once its quarterly results were out. While Q1 revenues were strong, with no pullback in Chinese ad-buying, Meta's Q2 guidance was a bit lower than Wall Street hoped to see. But the scale of its AI investment -- with Meta's estimate for the year now up 12% to $35 billion to $40 billion in spending and with next year's outlay set to be even greater -- is what proved truly sobering, especially with so little to show for it just yet.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg asked investors for patience and pointed out that Meta had \"historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we're investing and scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it.\" He also talked up the possibility of AI features in Meta's apps attracting more users and therefore more ad revenue, and AI-powered smart glasses taking off, but that wasn't enough to calm investors' nerves.\n\n\"The disappointment on the revenue side is overshadowing any optimism about AI,\" Cresset Wealth Advisors chief investment officer Jack Ablin told Bloomberg. \"It's hard to tell what the benefit will be to users, and while AI could ultimately mean some cost savings down the line, that isn't visible yet.\"\n\nIt is certainly true that big ideas need big investments, but if we're talking this big, it's very understandable that investors want to see some kind of solid strategy for profitability.\n\nThis is particularly true in the case of Meta, which -- lest we forget -- was until recently going all-in on the metaverse, another very expensive endeavor that has so far turned out to be a money pit (Meta's Reality Labs division lost over $16 billion last year, and $3.85 billion in Q1). Yes, AI has way more immediate, demonstrable uses than virtual reality does, but seeing it as a profitable venture still requires a hefty dollop of imagination.\n\nAnother likely factor here is Meta's open-source approach to releasing its Llama large language models. There are many real advantages to this, such as ensuring that there's a powerful and attractive alternative out there to models from the likes of OpenAI and Google, and getting the wider community to help improve Meta's AI. It may well pay off, but many investors will look at this strategy and ask where the moat is, and how Llama will make them tons of money.\n\nIs the reaction to Meta's outlay a damning indictment of Big Tech AI investments in general? We'll see after Microsoft and Alphabet's results later today, but it's worth remembering that those companies are also major cloud providers whose AI capex will likely pay off one way or another. Meta may find itself in a similar position after its spending spree -- Zuckerberg hinted at the possibility -- but right now that's not the business it's in.\n\nAt this point it's worth remembering that, like Elon Musk at Tesla, Zuckerberg is in the unusual position of being a law unto himself. Meta's board can't fire him, because of his voting control, and he has previously said that this allows him to take unpopular decisions that end up paying off. Meta's vast AI expenditure could prove to be a serious test of that structure's real utility, but either way, there's nothing to stop investors from punishing the company if they don't like what they see.\n\nTikTok pulls 'addictive' reward program. TikTok has suspended a feature in its new TikTok Lite app -- so far only available in France and Spain -- that rewarded users for watching videos, with the reward points being redeemable against vouchers and gift cards. The European Commission had reacted to the launch with fury, arguing that the feature could prove \"toxic and addictive\" for young users and therefore breached the new Digital Services Act (DSA), which governs online content. Faced with a possible suspension if it couldn't prove TikTok Lite wasn't addictive, the company opted to just remove the feature, the Guardian reports. TikTok is still the subject of DSA investigations over this and other matters.\n\nSchmidt backs AI-powered coding platform. Augment, which is taking on GitHub's Copilot with its own AI-powered coding platform, has raised $252 million from investors including former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, TechCrunch reports. The round gives Augment a valuation of $977 million. Other participants include the likes of Index Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners.\n\nSpotify vs Apple. Spotify says Apple has rejected a new version of its iOS app in Europe, which included information about Spotify's pricing and its website. The European Commission last month fined Apple $2 billion for the \"anti-steering\" tactics under which it stopped music streamers from being able to tell customers about cheaper subscriptions outside of the iOS ecosystem. Apple has since said it would allow links to off-platform subscription deals but would charge developers a fat fee for external purchases. \"Apple has once again defied the European Commission's decision, rejecting our update for attempting to communicate with customers about our prices unless we pay Apple a new tax,\" Spotify said, according to Reuters.\n\n-- Threads' monthly active user count, according to Mark Zuckerberg. The Instagram-linked X rival had 130 million MAUs in February, so it's growing steadily rather than explosively.\n\nThe CEO of OpenAI rival Cohere shakes off the haters: 'We're still sort of the underdog', by Sharon Goldman\n\nRubrik valued at $5.6 billion after massively oversubscribed IPO prices above range, by Mar\u00eda Soledad Davila Calero\n\nTesla driver said he was using Autopilot and looking at his phone before a crash that killed a motorcyclist, by the Associated Press\n\nChina drives both EV production and sales -- but the fate of the country's EV brands could soon be in the hands of emerging markets like Thailand, by Lionel Lim\n\nIBM shares fall after flatlining sales in its second-largest business unit, by Bloomberg\n\nThe AI frenzy could fall flat as companies hoard chips without enough data centers to host them, by Aroosh Thillainathan (Commentary)\n\nNet neutrality's back. The Federal Communications Commission will today take its final vote on the reinstatement of net neutrality rules in the U.S., under which telecoms network providers won't be allowed to favor certain online services over others in how they manage their traffic. Approval is certain due to the Democrats' dominance at the FCC, so the Obama-era rules -- suspended during the Trump era -- will soon be back in place.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType":

However, the firm increased its budget for both full-year operating expenses and capital spending, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg convinced that the firm should \"invest significantly more in the coming years\" into artificial intelligence. Zuckerberg expects a big step up in investment before AI services generate meaningful direct revenue. After accounting for faster revenue and expense growth in our forecast, we're leaving our fair value estimate at $400 per share. With the selloff following the earnings release, we believe the shares are fairly valued.\n\nTotal revenue increased 27% to $36.5 billion during the first quarter, with growth accelerating across geographies. Meta served 3.24 billion daily users across its apps during the quarter, up 7% versus a year ago. The volume of ads delivered increased 20% year on year, indicating continued strong growth in engagement thanks to improving content recommendations, a practical benefit of recent AI investment. Meta indicated that more than 50% of the content delivered on Instagram and 30% on Facebook is now AI-recommended. Ad pricing increased 6% year over year, showing continued acceleration from the fourth quarter after nearly two years of declines as advertiser demand remains strong.\n\nOperating expenses increased 6% compared with a year ago, with headcount increasing for the second consecutive quarter. The operating margin expanded to 38% from 25% a year ago. Meta now expects operating expenses to total $96 billion-$99 billion this year, raising the low end of the range of its prior forecast from $94 billion. Capital spending is expected in the range of $35 billion-$40 billion, up from $30 billion-$37 billion previously, and the firm again said that it plans to increase spending further in 2025.", "source": {"uri": "morningstar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Morningstar UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morningstar,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morningstar, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fair value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FactSet", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FactSet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.morningstar.co.uk/static/UploadManager/Assets/Meta%20Platforms%20logo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

By then, the market will be on the lookout for another product-cycle catalyst to keep ad momentum up.\n\n\"See sustainable multiple expansion driven by clear engagement and product catalysts to support the next leg of META share growth, as positive revision cycle driven by macro tailwinds moderates.

Meanwhile, over the past year, the Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp parent has surged 125%, crushing the 20% rise in the S&P 500 index.\n\nThe social media giant is set to report first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings results after the closing bell Wednesday. Its management has pushed all of the right buttons, including various cost optimization initiatives, many of which have enabled Meta to lower its 2023 expense guidance on two occasions this year. Given the stock's strong outperformance relative to its peers, investors want to know how much better things can get.\n\nWall Street analysts, meanwhile, remain bullish on the company's potential for further monetization, particularly amid its various cost optimization initiatives, including the recently announced round of layoffs, which will contribute $30 billion in value to shareholders. Additionally, META has entered the generative AI competition with its newly unveiled Llama 3 language model and image generator. These initiatives not only puts the company in a much stronger financial standing in the near term, suggesting there is still value to be realized in the stock.\n\nCitigroup analyst Ronald Josey recently reiterated his Buy rating on the stock and raised his target price to $590 from $525. \"With Meta's newer ad innovations (Adv.+ Creative, Reminder Ads, longer form Reels, etc.), a new AI video architecture, and greater overall advertiser adoption, we believe advertiser demand for Reels (and Meta) continues to improve,\" Josey wrote in the note to investors.\n\nAs such, the company on Wednesday must continue to show gradual improvements in these areas for the quarter and full year.\n\nFor the three months that ended March, the Menlo Park, Calif.-based company is expected to earn $4.31 per share on revenue of $36.14 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were $2.20 per share on revenue of $28.64 billion. For the full year ending in December, earnings are projected to rise 35% year over year to $20.07 per share, while full-year revenue of $158.48 billion would rise 17.5% year over year.\n\nThe fact that full-year earnings are projected to rise north of 30% highlights the reasons why Wall Street analysts are so bullish on Meta stock. The strong earnings projection is the result of the aforementioned various cost cutting measures the company has undertaken to become leaner and more profitable. Meta has also flexed its growth muscles within its core digital advertising business, given that it boasts an estimated 3 billion monthly active users on its family of products.\n\nThese fundamental improvements were notable and important to the bottom line in Q4 when it earned an adjusted $5.33 per share on $40.11 billion in revenue, beating EPS by a whopping 39 cents, while revenue grew 25% year over year, topping estimated by roughly $940 million. Q4 daily active users across its family of products was 3.19 billion on average, an increase of 8% year-over-year, while monthly active numbers reached 3.98 billion, an increase of 6% year-over-year.\n\nJust as important, Q4 ad impressions and price per ad impressions delivered across its Family of Apps grew by 21% year-over-year, while the average price per ad rose 2% year-over-year. Armed with tons of cash, thanks to efficiency improvements, the company also announced its first-ever dividend while boosting its stock buyback program by $50 billion. Given these key fundamental improvements, Meta stock will continue to outperform the market if the company on Wednesday can continue to assert its ad dominance while providing strong guidance for the quarter and full year.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.", "source": {"uri": "nasdaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NASDAQ Stock Market"}, "authors": [{"uri": "richard_saintvilus@nasdaq.com", "name": "Richard Saintvilus", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_generator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric generator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_Park,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Menlo Park, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Menlo Park, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_users", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Active users"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_repurchase", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Share repurchase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2022/06/14/meta-creativeneko-adobe.jpeg?1457946523", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

As such, shares are entering the 'penalty box,'\" Baird Equity Research analysts said.\n\nMeta forecast April-June revenue below estimates and raised the bottom end of its 2024 total expense forecast by $2 billion on Wednesday. It also raised the top end of its capital expenditure view as it invests in data centers essential to its efforts to catch up with AI frontrunners OpenAI and Microsoft.\n\nThe dour expectations follow a series of smash-hit earnings that helped Meta nearly triple its stock in 2023 and powered the biggest one-day market value gain by any company in Wall Street history, of $196 billion, in February after its maiden dividend.\n\nStill, several analysts were positive on the investments, pointing to AI-driven engagement on content such as Instagram Reels and the warm reception for its virtual assistant Meta AI and early versions of its latest large language model, Llama 3.\n\n\"We think this time it is different,\" said Evercore ISI analysts. \"This investment cycle comes from a position of strength, as management continues to see a healthy ad demand environment into Q2 and improving user engagement.\"\n\nOverall, 17 analysts lowered their price targets on the stock, while eight raised their view, according to LSEG data. The median price target now stands at $525, which is about 6% higher than its previous close.\n\nThe stock has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 23.12, compared with Microsoft's 31.17 and Alphabet's 22.07.

Shares of the Facebook parent sank more than 12% , a day after the company offered light guidance and highlighted plans to ramp up spending on artificial intelligence and mixed reality. The news stoked concerns around costs and Meta's spending, while overshadowing a top-and-bottom line beat . Some Wall Street firms trimmed their price targets on the social media giant in the wake of the results, but retained bets on the company's long-term potential as one of the top leaders in AI. Year to date, the stock has rallied 20% as investors continue to bet on those tailwinds. \"Despite the heavy investments, we still project double-digit revenue & EPS growth in '25 & '26, & Meta has a strong track record of driving returns on increased spending,\" said JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth. The analyst cut his price target to $480 from $535 a share, noting that building and creating new products is no easy -- or quick -- feat. The adjusted price target reflects nearly 3% downside from Wednesday's close. Meta Platforms is no stranger to betting on new technology. The company changed its name from Facebook in 2021 as it took a gamble on a metaverse vision. Not all of Meta's initiative have been a success, with Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black noting that boosted spending on Reels and Stories to keep up with competitors contributed to \"near-term cannibalization of better monetizing, though aging surfaces/formats.\" This time looks different as Meta works on \"adjacent services\" to complement its advertising model, Black said. Citi's Ronald Josey also noted that investments \"come from a position of strength whereby Meta is a leader.\" Elsewhere, Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan, who slashed his target to $500 a share from $555, highlighted management's strong track record of executing during past investment cycles. \"We continue to see META as well-positioned against several long-term secular growth themes and are encouraged by the positive momentum across key product initiatives incl. Reels, click-to-messaging Ads and AI including Advantage+ adoption,\" he wrote. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak retained his overweight rating and $550 price target, saying that the firm remains \"buyers through Meta's investments.\" Ongoing investments and innovation should power engagement and monetization growth, he said. Meta isn't alone in this feat, with Nowak expecting competitors to undertake similar steps as more AI opportunities arise. While Bank of America's Justin Post expects this investment cycle commentary to weigh on sentiment in the near term, he sees signs that the company is putting money in the \"right places.\" \"If there is anything META has proven over the years, it's extremely good at executing during big platform shifts in tech, arguably the best,\" said Barclays analyst Ross Sandler. \"We would let the dust settle on the tone shift here before adding to positions, but we didn't hear anything from [CEO Mark] Zuckerberg that causes major concern.\" Sandler trimmed his price target to $520 from $550 a share as revenue growth rates decelerate, but he views the company as one of the top three leaders in AI and top long-term name in the space.

With AI, the company appears to have a longer grace period since it's an industrywide bet, but even that will soon come under scrutiny for Meta, seeing as its expected capex is ticking up now for the year.\n\nAnd sure enough, the advertising-funded social network could not wait to turn the attention to AI, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg's quote in the earnings release, citing its new large language model (Llama 3) just released:\n\n\"The new version of Meta AI with Llama 3 is another step towards building the world's leading AI. We're seeing healthy growth across our apps and we continue making steady progress building the metaverse as well.\"\n\nTurning to the company's actual metrics, the total number of people using Meta's apps (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads) rose 7% year-over-year to 3.24 billion.\n\nThat's the only user metric we're getting from Meta, which said last quarter it would stop consistent reporting of MAUs and app-level metrics.\n\nTurning to revenue, ad revenue dropped sequentially as it always does in Q1 but rose YoY...\n\n... with Average Revenue per User dropping but higher than a year ago.\n\n... as the average price per ad rose significantly in Q1.\n\nMeanwhile, even as ad revenue dipped, expenses as a % of revenues are once again rising.\n\nPutting it all together, and taking a quick look at the stock price, we can conclude that the market is not impressed, as META shares are tumbling 13%...\n\n... with the plunge weighing on the Nasdaq and other social media stocks post-market. Shares of Snap are down 3.3%, while Pinterest has shed nearly 4%. Reddit is down 1.3%.\n\nThe company's earnings presentation is below (pdf link)\n\nAnd now we await the earnings call to see if Zuck can save this catastrophic earnings report.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snap Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinterest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pinterest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-04/2024-04-24_13-22-42%20%281%29.jpg?h=cce200ca&itok=bG56HyTe", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

Capital expenditures for 2024 are now expected between $35 billion and $40 billion, up from a prior range of $30 billion and $37 billion.\n\nThe higher cost outlook largely offset stronger-than-expected first-quarter earnings from the Facebook owner.\n\nMeta's earnings are likely to set a precedent for other major internet firms, as they undertake increased costs to gain an edge in AI computing, which has shot up in popularity over the past year.\n\nWhile majors such as Microsoft have already reaped higher earnings on the back of AI, costs have been steadily increasing, given the elevated computing requirements of AI programs.\n\nStill, Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) maintained its buy rating on Meta, stating that while investors were expected to have an initial negative reaction to the weak outlook, there was still potential in AI, and that the stock has been a strong year-to-date performer in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "in.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investing.com", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investing.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq-100", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq-100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_(academic)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major (academic)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Publicly_Traded", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Publicly Traded", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/akapi-images/800x450/91d857f8bfcaee41b90d4c1d0259c39d_w_800_h_450.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

The Facebook parent has surged along with fellow big technology peers, climbing about 40% in 2024 after soaring nearly 200% the prior year. And Meta has been able to sidestep the current market pullback, advancing more than 2% in April despite the Nasdaq Composite sliding more than 4%. Those moves come as Meta's focuses on efficiency and expands beyond social media into alternative reality and artificial intelligence technology. The \"Magnificent Seven\" stock is currently trading about 6% below an all-time high it hit earlier this month as traders ready for the latest news. Here's what investors should know ahead of the release: How the stock moved last time When Meta last reported earnings in early February, the fourth-quarter results prompted a major rally. The tech giant topped expectations on both lines and issued strong guidance for the first quarter. Meta also initiated a quarterly dividend of 50 cents and approved a $50 billion stock buyback. The stock price surged more than 20% - which equates to more than $80 per share - in the session following the print. By percentage move, that goes down in history as Meta's third best daily performance ever. Historically, Meta tends to do well on the back of its earnings. The company has surpassed Wall Street forecasts about 87% of the time , according to Bespoke Investment Group, and the stock gains an average of 2.3% on earnings days. What the Street expects For the first quarter, analysts polled by LSEG forecast $4.32 in earnings per share and $36.16 billion in revenue. The expected 26% rise in revenue year over year, combined with the company's cost cutting measures, has resulted in a huge earnings boost. More broadly, analysts tend to like the stock. The majority of those polled by LSEG have buy ratings, with a price target implying that shares can climb over 8% in the next year. Given the strong stock performance and most recent earnings report, Roth MKM managing director Rohit Kulkarni is now wondering if CEO Mark Zuckerberg can \"pull another bunny\" out of his hat. Kulkarni said he is \"marginally cautious\" ahead of the release given tougher comparable figures and as concerns tied to European regulations swirl. \"We believe a pathway towards mid-teens 4Q revenue growth and > $25 EPS in 2025 could help shares return to early April levels, and make new all-time highs,\" Kulkarni wrote to clients. \"However, we aren't certain that we get clarity into such a potential outcome this week.\" Key data Beyond the headline figures, analysts will monitor several smaller data points for insights into the health of the company. As a social media platform operator, they'll look at the total number of active users on a daily basis and minutes per active user. If these are trending upward, it can indicate higher engagement with Meta-owned apps like Facebook and Instagram. Average revenue per user is another important metric, as it can show how much each active user contributes in terms of profit. Some analysts also told clients they'll be monitoring guidance around full-year capital expenditure spending.", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_harring@cnbc.com", "name": "Alex Harring", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq_Composite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq Composite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_repurchase", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Share repurchase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_revenue_per_user", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Average revenue per user"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital expenditure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107368948-1707137441266-gettyimages-1978494980-raa-metaplat240204_npg9u.jpeg?v=1713898971&w=1920&h=1080", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every Thursday.\n\nMeta has had a huge week, but you wouldn't think so by looking at their stock chart. The social media and programming company's stock fell more than 11% after Wednesday's quarterly earnings that smashed expectations and represented 27% year-over-year sales growth. All this less than a week after the company launched what's been called a game-changing AI chatbot with an advanced open LLM.\n\nMeta's chatbot has been roundly feted not just because of what it can do, but because of how accessible it is. The chatbot -- which can provide answers, collate information from the internet, create images from text prompts and search Meta's social media feeds -- performs the same types of tasks as ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. But Meta's is integrated into its popular social media platforms, putting itself squarely where users already are, instead of making them go to another website. (Meta's chatbot is also available at its own URL.)\n\nBut it offers many more opportunities for developers, writes Forbes senior contributor Janakiram MSV. The Llama 3 LLM is much more advanced than others available, outperforming several other models on different parameters, including writing in English and coding. It will be available to developers to use, and is already integrated into several developer ecosystems, including Hugging Face. It can currently support a context length of 8,000 tokens, meaning it can respond to longer queries in more detail. And Meta is continuing to develop Llama 3 with eyes on expanding its capabilities, languages and versatility. The company expects new launches to be available later this year.\n\nAfter rolling out the new AI chatbot and LLM, and posting nearly $36.5 billion in quarterly revenue, the drop in Meta's share price seems shocking. However, the company expects its rapidly growing advertising sales to begin to slow down, expecting Q2 sales below average analyst estimates. It's also increased its expense outlook for the full year.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the earnings call Meta is working to build and scale its AI now, investing in its development, and is not concentrating on monetizing it just yet. But, he said, Meta has been here before. \"Historically, investing to build these new scaled experiences in our apps has been a very good long term investment for us and for investors who have stuck with us,\" he said.\n\nInvestors and people who work in technology are two very different cohorts with different priorities. But, as Forbes contributor Alex Zhavoronkov writes, in the tech space Llama 3 changes everything. Its LLM is likely to be what developers choose to build on, making Meta dominant in this area, just like it is in the social media space. While Meta's social media advertising revenue growth could be slowing down, future quarters will show how big its steps are in the AI space, as well as the business opportunities there.\n\nFor years, there's been a lot of talk about open source code, software and LLMs. Historically, open data has not been a thing, but that is changing. Marc Prioleau, executive director of the Open Maps Foundation, talked to me about why open data is important to the future. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.\n\nAfter years of talking about banning TikTok, the federal government actually did it this week. A measure requiring either the sale of Chinese company ByteDance's short video app to a U.S.-friendly owner, or eventually banning it from app stores, was added to a package of bills providing military aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. It passed both houses of Congress and was signed into law by President Joe Biden yesterday.\n\nAnd now the legal battle begins. Forbes' Alexandra S. Levine and Emily Baker-White report TikTok is not going down without a fight. In an internal memo over the weekend from Michael Beckerman, TikTok's top policy leader in the Americas, a court battle is promised. \"This legislation is a clear violation of the First Amendment rights of the 170 million Americans on TikTok,\" he wrote. Many said the sale of TikTok isn't a realistic goal, either. Forbes reporting has shown many of TikTok's internal systems are built on ByteDance tools custom-made years ago by Chinese engineers, which will be difficult to take apart. Former National Security Agency general counsel Glenn Gerstell said that what makes a divestiture more \"economically unrealistic\" is TikTok's sophisticated algorithm, which is something that China is not going to be willing to sell.\n\nHowever, Forbes contributor Peter Suciu points out, the TikTok issue may start another much needed conversation among policymakers: protecting data privacy. The reason the law targets TikTok is because China has used the app's data to spy on Americans. But in the U.S., data from apps can also be used in an invasive way. Approov CEO Ted Miracco told Suciu this legislation is a \"blunt instrument\" that doesn't address the root cause of the concerns, and laws that enact robust privacy protections for all apps, regardless of their home country, could do the job more effectively.\n\nApple's big move into VR headsets may not be paying off. Citing a report from Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst with TF International Securities, Forbes senior contributor Paul Tassi writes that Apple is cutting the number of Vision Pro VR units it will ship to the U.S. this year roughly in half -- from 700,000 to 800,000 to 400,000 to 450,000. Tassi says this isn't likely a problem with the price of the device, even though it is an expensive purchase of $3,500. It's more foundational than that: People don't want VR headsets. It's a lesson that Meta has seen in recent years, as its VR division Reality Labs has posted consistent losses. In its earnings report yesterday, the Meta division posted a $3.8 billion loss, and the company expects year-over-year losses to \"increase meaningfully.\"\n\nThe technology underlying AI is exciting, but Stanford University's Institute for Human-Centered AI's new annual AI Index is a reminder of what it is: a work in progress. Forbes senior contributor Joe McKendrick writes while AI can currently beat humans on some tasks, there are some complex areas in which people still win, like competition-level mathematics, visual common sense reasoning and planning. And AI developers themselves \"score low on transparency,\" which in turn hinders efforts to see how robust and safe the AI systems are. It also counts the number of \"bad AI\" incidents, which increased 32.3% last year.\n\nThe Overture Maps Foundation, a project to standardize map data, was founded in December 2022 by Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and TomTom, and is hosted by the Linux Foundation. I talked to Marc Prioleau about the project he's working on, which relies on open data from a number of sources, and what the future holds for open data. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version of this interview is available here.\n\nWhy do you think open data is such a brand new thing?\n\nI think that there are a lot of similarities between open code and open data, but there's some key differences. I think one of the things where open code and open data are similar is a bunch of people agree that they would be better off, they would have a better quality product if they collaborated on building something. Usually what happens in open code or open data is there's an \"open\" part, but then people still have the ability to create business models on top of that. I think open code took a while to figure that out, but that's pretty established now. Open data is going through the same thing. What are the areas where we can collaborate on data and it could be open, and still leave room for business models on top of that?\n\nThere's some differences. Let's say you're a software engineer. When you write code in an open source project, that code is open as you contribute it. Data is a little different, because data represents facts. It has to come from somewhere. It didn't just spring from your brain. It was a measurement of something. In mapping, that can be a measurement of: Is the road still there? Is that business still there? Did things change? What's upstream of open data that's different than open code is there's data collection and synthesis and analysis, and that usually is not necessarily open. I think that's a fairly different business proposition than open code.\n\nWhat do you think it would take to get more businesses and other entities interested in open data?\n\nThe thing I find is that conceptually, everyone understands the strategy around open data. They get it, they nod their heads, they do everything. The challenge becomes bringing a group together who actually will collaborate. One of the problems in any open source project is how do you share participation? Do you have people who are the so-called free riders, the people who are using the output of an open source project, but aren't contributing into it? Ultimately, if no one puts into it, the project goes away. I think the key part is really developing a mechanism where people can contribute and have incentives to contribute.\n\nStrategically, at least for our project, I can describe it to people and they understand the strategy, the rationale, the reason you'd want to do it. The reason it makes sense. I don't find that being a hard part at all. But, you know, then people have to do it. They have to go the distance. We started with four members. Now we're at 27. Part of it is the benefit that they get if this happens, and the alternative if it doesn't happen. The alternatives aren't good.\n\nIn five years, do you think open data will be seen more like open code and open software today?\n\nI think it's going to be a related but distinct field. Today, people think open source is open source. Code data doesn't matter. I think what you'll see five years from now is open data will become a distinct entity. It's for these things we talked about. Data has to come from somewhere, and so you need people contributing things that are often proprietary and have value. Data has to be accurate.

Here's what analysts at some of the largest investment firms thought: Eric Sheridan, Goldman Sachs (Buy, PT at $500) \"With management referencing past investment/product cycles such as Stories and Reels ... we do expect the shares to remain volatile in the coming quarters (especially so if increased investment is met with downward revenue revisions from new levels). That said, we'd note that historically management has been able to effectively navigate such investment cycles and execute to position the platform for long-term success around product/computing shifts.\" Brian Nowak, Morgan Stanley (Overweight, PT at $550): \"META intends to continue to invest ... in order to drive more engagement and monetization, but we are buyers of META on weakness, with it currently trading at 18X our new '25 FCF (5.5% yield) in after hours. It also implies 17X '25 earnings (a 15% discount to the 5yr FY2 average).\" Doug Anmuth, JPMorgan (Overweight, PT down to $480 from $535): \"We are encouraged that Meta's success w/Llama 3 & Meta AI has increased management's confidence in leading in AI, & we know that building out new products takes time, but comparisons to the scaling periods of Reels, Stories, & Feed into mobile will concern many investors, even as we can see those long-term payoffs. ... Despite the heavy investments, we still project double-digit revenue & EPS growth in '25 & '26, & Meta has a strong track record of driving returns on increased spending.\" Ronald Josey, Citi (Buy rating, PT down to $550 from $590): \"The key debate coming out of earnings is likely to be around the size and scale of Meta's multi-year GenAI investment cycle. But unlike previous cycles (Mobile, Stories, Reels), we believe its GenAI investments come from a position of strength whereby Meta is a leader. More NT, the debate likely revolves around the pace of revenue deceleration given 2Q guidance and rising Capex spend. But ... we believe Meta continues to have multiple tailwinds, including from Llama 3, Meta AI and Business AI (Agents).\" -- Alex Harring 5:38 a.m.: Bernstein initiates GM as outperform General Motors' 2024 gains are only the beginning of a strong period for the automotive giant, according to Bernstein. Analysts Daniel Roeska initiated GM with an outperform rating. His price target of $55 implies upside of 22% over the next 12 months. Roeska noted that GM is \"finding its mojo again,\" adding: \"The company is pivoting from lofty long-term targets back to more tangible shareholder returns.\" \"We expect 2024's performance to push the stock higher, while management has four distinct opportunities to realize more value still,\" the analyst said. \"We are encouraged by stronger cash flows and expect the company to return > $4.5b to shareholders per year.\" The note came after General Motors posted earlier this week first-quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations. The company also raised its 2024 guidance . GM shares are up more than 25% year to date.

To date, they have committed more than $6.7 billion through their philanthropy, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, to support their goal to help scientists cure, prevent or manage all disease as well as other projects across education and supporting their local communities.\"\n\nDespite making just $11 in salary since 2013, Zuckerberg has seen his wealth balloon by more than $47 billion so far this year.\n\nAccording to the Bloomberg Billionaire's Index, Zuckerberg is the third richest person in the world with a net worth of $176 billion -- only trailing behind French luxury fashion tycoon Bernard Arnault and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, who boast $220 billion and $202 billion, respectively.\n\nThe Menlo Park, Calif.-based business raked in $134.9 billion in revenue in 2023 due to its popularity among 4 billion-plus monthly users -- some 3 billion of which come from Facebook alone.\n\nThe majority of Zuckerberg's lucrative year thus far comes from his roughly 13% stake in Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, according to Bloomberg.\n\nYear to date, Meta's share price has also rocketed more than 43%, closing Wednesday at $493.50.\n\nZuckerberg isn't the only CEO with the $1 salary:\n\nTesla's Elon Musk, Yelp chief Jeremy Stoppelman and Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have also made just $1 per year at their respective companies.\n\nFormer Apple

IBM unveils mixed first-quarter earnings and announces that it will acquire cloud software firm HashiCorp (NASDAQ: HCP ) in a $6.4 billion deal. Elsewhere, the U.S. economy is expected to have slowed in the opening three months of 2024, but remain resilient in the face of high interest rates and persistent inflationary pressures.\n\n1. Futures inch lower\n\nStock futures in New York pointed lower on Thursday, as investors assessed earnings from big-name technology companies and looked ahead to a fresh U.S. economic growth reading.\n\nAlong with results after the closing bell on Wednesday from Meta Platforms (see below), traders will likely be keen to pour through quarterly figures from software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) later today. First-quarter U.S. gross domestic product data, which could provide some insight into the health of the world's largest economy and potentially factor into how the Federal Reserve approaches future monetary policy decisions, will also be in focus on Thursday.\n\n2. Meta shares fall as CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlines AI spending plans\n\nShares in Meta Platforms dropped by more than 15% in extended hours U.S. trading, erasing billions of dollars from its market value, despite the social media group posting better-than-estimated revenue in the first three months of 2024.\n\nMeta, whose family of apps also includes Instagram and WhatsApp, elevated its projected annual capital expenditures forecast to $40 billion from $37 billion, citing a desire to \"accelerate\" an ongoing push to expand its artificial intelligence capabilities. Last year, Meta spent $28.1B.\n\nIn a call with analysts, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, who previously backed strict cost-cutting measures throughout much of 2023, said that the increased investments were needed to help Meta become \"the leading AI company in the world.\"\n\n\"[S]uch a narrative results in a slight reduction in forward revenue trends,\" analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients.\n\nSpending around the development of AI is set to also be a key focus when Meta peers Microsoft and Alphabet report their latest returns after the closing bell on Thursday.\n\n3. IBM shares dip following mixed earnings, HashiCorp deal announcement\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE: IBM ) reported a mixed set of first-quarter results and announced it had reached an agreement to acquire cloud software provider Hashicorp (NASDAQ: HCP ) for $6.4 billion.\n\nThe technology group posted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.68, beating consensus estimates of $1.58. However, revenue for the quarter was slightly below expectations at $14.46 billion, missing projections of $14.51 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, IBM also said it would buy HashiCorp for $35 per share in cash, as the company looks to take advantage of an AI-fuelled boom in demand for cloud software products. The acquisition price represents a 42.6% premium to the closing price of HashiCorp's shares on Monday.\n\nShares in IBM edged lower in after-hours trading.\n\n4. U.S. economic growth seen slowing in first quarter - forecasts\n\nU.S. economic activity is expected to have decelerated to a still solid pace in the first quarter thanks in large part to a resilient labor market and strong consumer spending.\n\nThe Commerce Department's reading of gross domestic product is seen slowing to 2.5% in the first three months of the year from 3.4% in the fourth quarter, in a sign that the U.S. remains more robust than other advanced economies despite a period of sticky inflation and elevated interest rates.\n\nAccording to Reuters, economists have argued that American consumers moved to secure lower mortgage payments and businesses locked in refinanced debt prior to the tightening cycle, helping insulate themselves from higher rates. Firms, wary of losing workers after a period of labor shortages before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, have also been more reticent to let go of employees.\n\nThe GDP print will serve as a precursor to Friday's release of the personal consumption expenditures index excluding food and fuel, a measure closely watched by Federal Reserve officials. Signs of economic strength and lingering price pressures could impact expectations that the Fed may now choose to hold off on cutting rates down from more than two-decade highs until later this year.\n\n5. Oil edges higher\n\nOil prices rose slightly in European trade on Thursday as traders digested middling cues from U.S. inventory data and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.\n\nBrent oil futures expiring in June edged up 0.2% to $88.16 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures moved up 0.1% to $82.92 a barrel by 03:29 ET.\n\nOfficial U.S. inventory data showed on Wednesday that oil stockpiles shrank by 6.4 million barrels in the week to April 19, largely ducking estimates for a build of 1.6 million barrels. But distillate stockpiles saw an unexpected, 1.6 million barrel build, while gasoline inventories shrank by a smaller-than-expected 0.6 million barrels.\n\nElsewhere, hopes remain that recent hostilities between Iran and Israel will not escalate into all-out war. While both countries carried out strikes against each other over the past two weeks, neither side gave any indication that it wanted to further escalate the violence.\n\nSome traders have subsequently wound down expectations that worsening geopolitical tensions in the Middle East will disrupt oil supplies from the oil-rich region.", "source": {"uri": "za.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Revenue was 1% higher than consensus at $36.46 billion, up 27% year-on-year. This is the highest year-on-year (YoY) growth since 3Q 2021.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) has beaten expectations by 9.8%, coming in at $4.71 and up more than two-fold from the $2.20 a year ago. Net profit margin was above estimate too, coming in at 33.9% versus the 31.1% consensus.\n\nIts other operating metrics have been encouraging as well. Average price per ad increased 6% YoY, ad impressions were up 20% YoY, while family daily active people (DAP) increased 7% YoY.\n\nWith the 40% run-up in its share price year-to-date, expectations are in place for the company to outperform on all fronts, leaving little room for error. It seems hard to find fault with the current set of results, but market participants were expecting more from Meta in terms of its forward sales outlook.\n\nThe company guided for 2Q 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $36.5-39 billion, with the midpoint of the revenue outlook ($37.8 billion) falling below the $38.3 billion market consensus. There may be some concerns as to whether we have already seen the peak in growth momentum, with year-on-year revenue growth to potentially fall to 18.1% in 2Q 2024 from the current 27.3%.\n\nGiven the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) race among the big tech, Meta has been under pressure to keep up on its AI capabilities in order to fend off competition as well. The company is anticipating a $5 billion cost increase from its AI infrastructure investments for 2024 and expects capital expenditures to continue to increase next year.\n\n\"We anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35-40 billion, increased from our prior range of $30-37 billion.\"\n\nThis will be a new record high for the company's capital expenditure, but there may be some reservations on whether the huge amount will pay off. Having invested heavily in the metaverse since the end of 2020, its metaverse-oriented Reality Labs division is still faced with growing losses ($3.85 billion operating loss in 1Q 2024).

However, the stock price tumbled as much as 15% to $420 in premarket trading on Thursday, indicating Zuckerberg's shares are now worth $25 billion less at $145 billion.\n\nIf that decline persists after the market open, Zuckerberg's net worth could plunge to under $150 billion. That would rank him in fifth place on Bloomberg's rich list, below Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, assuming Gates' wealth doesn't drop significantly too.\n\nA $25 billion reduction in wealth in one day would be remarkable, as only the top 70 richest people in the world command fortunes of that size.\n\nMoreover, Zuckerberg's net worth was up $47 billion this year prior to Wednesday's close, making him the biggest wealth gainer on the list by far.\n\nHe even overtook Elon Musk a few days ago, largely thanks to Tesla's ongoing troubles. But Musk has regained third place thanks to a post-earnings bump in Tesla's stock price.\n\nZuckerberg seemed eager to reassure shareholders about Meta's sliding stock price during the company's earnings call on Wednesday. Yet he also made clear that it wouldn't deter him from investing heavily in artificial intelligence.\n\n\"We've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook, where we're investing and scaling a new product, but aren't yet monetizing it,\" he said. \"We saw this with Reels, Stories, as News Feed transitioned to mobile and more.\"\n\n\"Historically investing to build these new scaled experiences in our apps has been a very good long-term investment for us and for investors who have stuck with us and the initial signs are quite positive here too,\" he continued. \"But building a leading AI will also be a larger undertaking than the other experiences we've added to our apps and this is likely going to take several years.\"\n\nMeta wasn't the only Big Tech stock under pressure, signaling investors may be souring on AI, or worrying about market headwinds such as foreign conflicts, stubborn inflation, a potential recession, and interest rates perhaps staying higher for longer.\n\nThe Facebook owner was poised to shed over $180 billion of market value on Thursday.

Previously, Alex served as a...\n\nMark Zuckerberg, an American entrepreneur and computer programmer, rose to prominence as the co-founder and CEO of Facebook, which was rebranded as Meta Platforms on October 28, 2021.\n\nThanks to his entrepreneurial success and his role in shaping the digital age, Zuckerberg has become one of the most powerful figures in the tech space.\n\nCurrently, Facebook is the largest social network in the world, with approximately 3 billion active monthly users.\n\nIn this article, we explore the growth of Mark Zuckerberg's net worth from his days at Harvard University when he launched \"TheFacebook\" with his college roommates to his current standing as one of the richest men in the world.\n\nMark Zuckerberg's money was made primarily through his creation and leadership of Facebook.\n\nHe co-founded the social networking platform in 2004 while he was a student at Harvard University. Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard in November 2005 to focus solely on building Facebook.\n\nSo, how did Mark Zuckerberg get rich? As Facebook gained popularity, it attracted millions of users and advertisers, leading to significant revenue growth. Zuckerberg became a self-made billionaire in 2008 when he was just 23. Facebook went public in 2012, and Zuckerberg's ownership stake in the company made him a billionaire many times over.\n\nToday, he is one of the wealthiest individuals in the world, with a substantial portion of his wealth tied to his shares in Meta.\n\nEarly Ventures\n\nBefore starting Facebook, Zuckerberg was involved with a few early business ventures. These include:\n\nThese early ventures laid the foundation for Zuckerberg's entrepreneurial journey and set the stage for the immense success of Facebook.\n\nBreakthrough With Facebook & Its Impact on Zuckerberg's Wealth\n\nFacebook has had a massive impact on Mark Zuckerberg's wealth. As the co-founder and CEO of Facebook, Zuckerberg has been able to amass a substantial fortune through his ownership of the company's stock. The success and growth of Facebook have played crucial roles in increasing Mark Zuckerberg's net worth.\n\nThe success of Facebook can be attributed to a number of factors. For example, its user-friendly interface played a crucial role in enabling people to easily connect with each other and share information. As such, the social networking platform attracted a vast user base, which fueled its rapid growth.\n\nAs Facebook's popularity grew, it became a magnet for investors and advertisers, thanks to its ability to target specific demographics and deliver personalized advertisements. This made it an attractive marketing platform that enabled the company to generate significant revenue.\n\nWhen Facebook went public in 2012, Zuckerberg's stake in the company was valued at $19.1 billion. Since then, the value of the company's stock has continued to rise, contributing to his wealth.\n\nAs of 2024, Mark Zuckerberg is one of the wealthiest individuals in the world, primarily due to his ownership of Meta.\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg's wealth doesn't depend on Meta's success alone. He has also made other investments and acquisitions, further diversifying his portfolio. However, Meta remains a significant factor in his overall wealth.\n\nSo, what is Mark Zuckerberg's net worth? Well, his wealth is estimated at $171 billion as of April 22, 2024, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe following table illustrates the evolution of Zuckerberg's wealth since 2015:\n\nWealth Fluctuations\n\nSeveral factors have influenced the rise and fall of Mark Zuckerberg's net worth over the years.\n\nWhen Facebook went public in May 2012, Zuckerberg's net worth surged to approximately $19 billion. However, since then, the company's stock price has experienced significant fluctuations.\n\nFor example, in July 2018, Facebook's stock price dropped by around 20% due to concerns over data privacy and security breaches. This decline led to a decline in Zuckerberg's net worth by approximately $16 billion.\n\nIn addition, Zuckerberg has periodically sold portions of his Facebook shares. In 2012, during its initial public offering, he sold approximately 30.2 million shares, generating around $1.13 billion. In 2016, he sold around $1 billion worth of shares to fund his philanthropic initiatives.\n\nFacebook's acquisition of Instagram in 2012 was valued at approximately $1 billion. This acquisition significantly contributed to the growth of Facebook's user base and revenue streams, subsequently increasing Zuckerberg's net worth.\n\nIn 2019, Facebook faced a $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission due to privacy violations. This fine impacted Facebook's stock price and consequently affected Zuckerberg's net worth.\n\nThen, in 2022, Mark Zuckerberg's wealth took another hit as Meta Platforms Inc.'s stock value declined significantly for a number of reasons. For one thing, Meta announced a strategic shift toward becoming a metaverse-focused company, which led to additional expenses due to aggressive hiring for initiatives related to the metaverse.\n\nAnd although Meta's family of apps, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, continued to generate profits, the company's Reality Labs unit reported an operating loss. Not only that, but Meta's Q4 2021 earnings missed expectations as diluted earnings per share were slightly below analysts' predictions.\n\nOverall, Meta's shares plummeted by approximately 70% in 2022, making it the biggest drop among major tech companies. Consequently, as its chief executive and largest shareholder, Zuckerberg's net worth plummeted by approximately $81 billion during that year. However, in 2023, Mark Zuckerberg added approximately $84 billion to his net worth.\n\nAs of April 22, 2024, Mark Zuckerberg was the third richest individual on the planet with $171 billion, behind Bernard Arnault with $218 billion, and Jeff Bezos with $199 billion, and ahead of Elon Musk, who sits at number four with $164 billion, according to data from Bloomberg.\n\nWhat Does Mark Zuckerberg Own?\n\nMark Zuckerberg owns many companies, some of which were acquired by Meta Platforms.\n\nMeta Platforms is a parent company overseeing Meta's multiple subsidiaries and ventures. It encompasses everything from social media platforms to virtual reality and more.\n\nZuckerberg owns approximately 345 million shares of Meta Platforms, which makes up the bulk of his net worth.\n\nCompanies under Meta Platforms's umbrella:\n\nMark Zuckerberg's Real Estate & Other Investments\n\nAs an angel investor, Mark Zuckerberg's investments include Bluefield, VeriSIM Life, and Intercom within the business/productivity software and biotechnology industries, according to Pitchbook.\n\nIt's unclear what Zuckerberg's current real estate holdings are. A 4,800-square-foot gated mansion linked to Zuckerberg was reportedly sold in Woodside, California, in March 2024 for $29,6 million.\n\nAnd in 2022, Zuckerberg sold a home in Dolores Heights, a neighborhood in San Francisco, for $31 million. He purchased the home in 2012.\n\nZuckerberg also apparently owns property in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, that he purchased in 2019 for $59 million.\n\nIn addition, Mark Zuckerberg owns a 1,400-acre compound on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, known as Koolau Ranch, that reportedly cost more than $270 million.\n\nPhilanthropy & Spending\n\nIn 2015, Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, established the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), a philanthropic organization with a mission to enhance human potential and promote equality.\n\nThe CZI is dedicated to addressing various societal issues, including science, education, and justice. As part of their commitment, Zuckerberg and Chan have pledged to contribute 99% of their Meta shares to the CZI throughout their lives.\n\nSince its inception, the CZI has actively supported research on rare diseases, invested in educational technology, and provided assistance to affordable housing initiatives.\n\nAdditionally, in 2010, Mark Zuckerberg signed the Giving Pledge, a collective effort by some of the world's richest people to donate a significant portion of their wealth to charitable causes.\n\nBy participating in the Giving Pledge, Zuckerberg has committed to donating at least half of his wealth to philanthropic endeavors during his lifetime.\n\nLiving a Modest Lifestyle\n\nDespite his enormous wealth, Zuckerberg lives a relatively modest lifestyle. For example, his typical wardrobe consists of jeans, T-shirts, and hoodies.\n\nAnd unlike other billionaires, Zuckerberg doesn't spend his money on luxury vehicles.\n\nIn fact, his cars have included an Acura TSX, a Honda Fit, and a black Volkswagen Golf GTI.\n\nThe only vehicle that Mark Zuckerberg has ever splurged on is the Pagani Huayra, which he purchased in 2014 for $2 million.\n\nHowever, if he so desired, there are any number of insanely expensive items Zuckerberg could purchase and still not even make a dent in his $171 billion fortune, including:\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nMark Zuckerberg's wealth is a testament to his extraordinary entrepreneurial journey and the success of Meta. With a net worth that continues to soar, he is one of the wealthiest people on the planet.\n\nAs Zuckerberg continues to navigate the challenges of managing his wealth and the responsibilities that come with it, the impact of his philanthropic efforts and the decisions he makes will shape his legacy in the years to come.", "source": {"uri": "techopedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

IBM unveils mixed first-quarter earnings and announces that it will acquire cloud software firm HashiCorp (NASDAQ: HCP) in a $6.4 billion deal. Elsewhere, the U.S. economy is expected to have slowed in the opening three months of 2024, but remain resilient in the face of high interest rates and persistent inflationary pressures.\n\n1. Futures inch lower\n\nStock futures in New York pointed lower on Thursday, as investors assessed earnings from big-name technology companies and looked ahead to a fresh U.S. economic growth reading.\n\nBy 03:30 ET (07:30 GMT), the Dow futures contract had shed 95 points or 0.2%, S&P 500 futures had dipped by 34 points or 0.7%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had slipped by 211 points or 1.2%.\n\nThe main indices on Wall Street registered a mixed close in the prior session following choppy trading, with the benchmark S&P 500 gaining 0.02% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rising by 0.1%. The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated by 0.1%.\n\nAlong with results after the closing bell on Wednesday from Meta Platforms (see below), traders will likely be keen to pour through quarterly figures from software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) later today. First-quarter U.S. gross domestic product data, which could provide some insight into the health of the world's largest economy and potentially factor into how the Federal Reserve approaches future monetary policy decisions, will also be in focus on Thursday.\n\n2. Meta shares fall as CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlines AI spending plans\n\nShares in Meta Platforms dropped by more than 15% in extended hours U.S. trading, erasing billions of dollars from its market value, despite the social media group posting better-than-estimated revenue in the first three months of 2024.\n\nMeta, whose family of apps also includes Instagram and WhatsApp, elevated its projected annual capital expenditures forecast to $40 billion from $37 billion, citing a desire to \"accelerate\" an ongoing push to expand its artificial intelligence capabilities. Last year, Meta spent $28.1B.\n\nIn a call with analysts, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, who previously backed strict cost-cutting measures throughout much of 2023, said that the increased investments were needed to help Meta become \"the leading AI company in the world.\"\n\n\"[S]uch a narrative results in a slight reduction in forward revenue trends,\" analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients.\n\nSpending around the development of AI is set to also be a key focus when Meta peers Microsoft and Alphabet report their latest returns after the closing bell on Thursday.\n\n3. IBM shares dip following mixed earnings, HashiCorp deal announcement\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) reported a mixed set of first-quarter results and announced it had reached an agreement to acquire cloud software provider Hashicorp (NASDAQ: HCP) for $6.4 billion.\n\nThe technology group posted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.68, beating consensus estimates of $1.58. However, revenue for the quarter was slightly below expectations at $14.46 billion, missing projections of $14.51 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, IBM also said it would buy HashiCorp for $35 per share in cash, as the company looks to take advantage of an AI-fuelled boom in demand for cloud software products. The acquisition price represents a 42.6% premium to the closing price of HashiCorp's shares on Monday.\n\nShares in IBM edged lower in after-hours trading.\n\n4. U.S. economic growth seen slowing in first quarter - forecasts\n\nU.S. economic activity is expected to have decelerated to a still solid pace in the first quarter thanks in large part to a resilient labor market and strong consumer spending.\n\nThe Commerce Department's reading of gross domestic product is seen slowing to 2.5% in the first three months of the year from 3.4% in the fourth quarter, in a sign that the U.S. remains more robust than other advanced economies despite a period of sticky inflation and elevated interest rates.\n\nAccording to Reuters, economists have argued that American consumers moved to secure lower mortgage payments and businesses locked in refinanced debt prior to the tightening cycle, helping insulate themselves from higher rates. Firms, wary of losing workers after a period of labor shortages before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, have also been more reticent to let go of employees.\n\nThe GDP print will serve as a precursor to Friday's release of the personal consumption expenditures index excluding food and fuel, a measure closely watched by Federal Reserve officials. Signs of economic strength and lingering price pressures could impact expectations that the Fed may now choose to hold off on cutting rates down from more than two-decade highs until later this year.\n\n5. Oil edges higher\n\nOil prices rose slightly in European trade on Thursday as traders digested middling cues from U.S. inventory data and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.\n\nBrent oil futures expiring in June edged up 0.2% to $88.16 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures moved up 0.1% to $82.92 a barrel by 03:29 ET.\n\nOfficial U.S. inventory data showed on Wednesday that oil stockpiles shrank by 6.4 million barrels in the week to April 19, largely ducking estimates for a build of 1.6 million barrels. But distillate stockpiles saw an unexpected, 1.6 million barrel build, while gasoline inventories shrank by a smaller-than-expected 0.6 million barrels.\n\nElsewhere, hopes remain that recent hostilities between Iran and Israel will not escalate into all-out war. While both countries carried out strikes against each other over the past two weeks, neither side gave any indication that it wanted to further escalate the violence.\n\nSome traders have subsequently wound down expectations that worsening geopolitical tensions in the Middle East will disrupt oil supplies from the oil-rich region.", "source": {"uri": "streetinsider.com", "dataType": "news",

The tech entrepreneur's base salary for 2023 was a humble $1 dollar, while the median worker at the tech giant took home a staggering $379,000.\n\nIn comparison, the average tech worker can expect to earn between $35,000 to $120,000 depending on the role, according to Indeed.\n\nBut don't be fooled by Zuckerberg's humble base pay and the fact that he didn't take home a bonus last year -- the billionaire still cost the company millions in compensation.\n\nAccording to a proxy filing statement published ahead of the annual meeting of shareholders at the end of May, the Facebook founder received $24.4 million in 'other compensation' -- much of which covered his security costs.\n\nIn 2023, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp, revealed that it had increased Zuckerberg's personal security pre-tax allowance by 40% from $10 million in 2018 to around $14 million.\n\nThe announcement came just after the company laid off 11,000 employees, the equivalent of 13% of its workforce, leading various publications to link the two.\n\nHowever, since then the company has slashed thousands of more jobs, while Zuckerberg's spending on security has actually slightly decreased.\n\nIn 2022, the social networking chief splashed out $14,829,245 on personal security \"at his residences and during personal travel,\" according to the proxy filing. Meanwhile, last year -- during Meta's \"year of efficiency\" -- his security bill came to a total of $9,431,139.\n\nThe compensation payment also includes almost $1 million \"for costs related to personal usage of private aircraft.\"\n\nWhile justifying the cost, Meta explained that it has identified \"specific threats\" to Zuckerberg as the face of the brand, including being targeted by angry customers.\n\n\"We believe that Mr. Zuckerberg's role puts him in a unique position: he is synonymous with Meta and, as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,\" the company wrote in the filing.\n\n\"Mr. Zuckerberg is one of the most-recognized executives in the world, in large part as a result of the size of our user base and our continued exposure to global media, legislative, and regulatory attention.\"\n\nFortune has contacted Meta for comment.\n\nZuckerberg's been part of the $1 salary club -- which has previously included Larry Page, Larry Ellison and the late Steve Jobs -- since 2013, making his salary earnings just $11 in over a decade.\n\nBut he's seen his personal wealth balloon. In February, his net worth soared by $28 billion in just one day thanks to Meta's better-than-expected fourth quarterly results.\n\nAfter a year of being in cost-cutting mode, including dismissing about 21,000 workers, the company doubled its operating margin to 41% and decreased expenses by 8% year over year.\n\nAs a result of Meta's turnaround success, Zuckerberg -- whose wealth is largely tied to his stake in the social media giant -- has leap-frogged Elon Musk as the world's third-richest person, according to data from Bloomberg.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Ellison", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larry Ellison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fortune (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larry Page"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-dollar_salary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "One-dollar salary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_worth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net worth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1693797798-e1713957139439.jpg?resize=1200,600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 100, "relevance": 1}

The Facebook parent mostly delivered: earnings per share beat expectations, with profits more than doubling from a year earlier. Sales were better than expected, too: up 27% from the same time last year, pushing the rate of revenue growth up for the fifth straight quarter. But weaker-than-usual revenue guidance for the current quarter and higher expected costs were a downer, sending the stock plunging more than 10% in late trading.\n\nWhile some tech companies - ahem, Apple - are drag-and-dropping little AI enhancements into their products, Meta released the third version of its Llama system last week. The open-source large language model is fit to compete with the likes of ChatGPT, but it's costing Meta more than a few pretty pennies and that's understandably making investors nervous. That said, the company believes the tech will prove its worth by making users more engaged, scraping their behavioral data, and eventually paving the way for fresh monetization strategies.\n\nThe bigger picture: What to expect when you're expecting success.\n\nThe world's biggest tech companies have solid track records of growing profit. That doesn't just translate into high valuations and stock prices, but also extremely elevated expectations.

Meanwhile my 20-year-old Facebook profile and business page has been hacked and Meta has been zero percent helpful in getting it back under my control.'\n\nBut it seems Zuckerberg's appearance seems to matter more than the suspicious light cast on his platforms.\n\nFrom the awkward college student inventing Facebook in his dorm room at Harvard University to the body-building UFC fighter he's become today, Zuckerberg's transformation has been nothing short of astounding.\n\nJV Quantum shared on X: 'From awkward college kid to hoodie-wearing tech mogul to sunscreen-slathered surfer dude, Mark Zuckerberg's metamorphosis is the epitome of 'glow up.'\n\nZuckerberg took to Instagram to share an update on Meta's AI technology last week which showed off an edited image of himself with a scruffy beard and tanned skin that many people believed was real.\n\nTheir shock at the change was palpable, with people focusing on the chain around his neck and his facial hair, while others simply called him a 'snack.'\n\nZuckerberg has also grown his hair out recently and is wearing jewelry for the first time. He and his wife Pricilla were mocked for showing up to a UFC fight in 'mob-style'\n\nMark Zuckerberg founded Facebook from his dorm room at Harvard University in 2004 (pictured)\n\nMark Zuckerberg went back to college and graduated in 2017 after dropping out from Harvard when Facebook took off in 2004\n\nZuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan were dressed to impress for last month's Anant Ambani's $1 million watch during at lavish pre-wedding party branded 'enchanting' by fellow attendee Ivanka Trump\n\nThe AI-generated picture is a stark contrast from the clean-shaven Meta CEO who started donning fur coats and designer sweaters that left many people asking if he'd acquired a stylist.\n\nDressing down 'is so played out,' Andrew Weitz, a Los Angeles-based executive-style consultant told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nExecutives are 'tailored more properly, or what they're wearing is just different,' he said, adding: 'They don't want to look like everybody else.'\n\nZuckerberg impressed the masses when he showed off a shirtless photo last year, alongside UFC champions Israel Adesanya and Alex Volkanovski before heading into the ring for training.\n\nIn the post, Adesanya wrote: 'No fugazi with Mark. This is Serious Business\u203c\ufe0f'\n\nSilicon Valley has been notorious for tech moguls wearing the more simplistic attire to instead focus on their product, dating back to Apple founder Steve Jobs.\n\nZuckerberg went so far as to speak on the topic in a 2014 Facebook forum, saying he wore a T-shirt everyday because 'I really want to clear my life so that I have to make as few decisions as possible, other than how to best serve this community.'\n\nHowever, those simply shirts still cost the CEO around $300 each.\n\nREAD MORE: Facebook billionaire Mark Zuckerberg, 39, stuns the internet with his WILD 'glow up'\n\nMark Zuckerberg has been teased online for 'hitting puberty late' after fans have spotted his recent 'cool guy' glow up and were left 'shocked' by his new look\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe look was supposed to be synonymous with 'a carefully constructed image and narrative used to reinforce its myths,' Venky Ganesan, a partner at the venture capital firm Menlo Ventures told the New York Times.\n\nThere has been the myth that wearing a simple outfit means the those working in the tech world are focused on providing an honest, well thought out, and safe product, but Ganesan told the outlet: 'The playbook is changing.'\n\nIn January, the Meta CEO stood before Congress to address allegations that the social media platform had widely impacted youth's mental health, resulting in depression and in some cases their deaths.\n\nDuring the hearing, Zuckerberg apologized to the parents and families who said their children had died because of issues related to social media.\n\n'I'm sorry for everything you have all been through,' Zuckerberg said at the hearing.\n\n'No one should have to go through the things that your families have suffered, and this is why we invested so much and are going to continue doing industry-leading efforts to make sure that no one has to go through the types of things that your families had to suffer.'\n\nThe Child Safety hearing wasn't the first time Facebook has come under fire after it gained international attention for selling users data between 2011 and 2015 to more than 60 companies including Nike, AOL, UPS, and the Hinge dating app.\n\nThe question remains if Zuckerberg can rebrand himself enough to rebrand his platform as the positive social media apps it was marketed as back in his small dorm room at Harvard.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki",

Leaked Emails Reveal", "body": "Leaked emails, which originally surfaced in 2020, allegedly revealing discussions between Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and then Facebook CFO David Ebersman, have resurfaced online.\n\nFacebook's acquisition of Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 is seen as a major turning point. Initially, analysts criticized the hefty price tag for Instagram. However, today, the photo and video-sharing app is valued at a staggering $500 billion, showcasing Zuckerberg's strategic vision and willingness to take risks.\n\nA set of leaked emails, also from 2020, purportedly showing conversations between Zuckerberg and his team prior to the Instagram acquisition, is once again making rounds on social media. Nevertheless, the alleged exchange sheds some light on factors to consider when planning an acquisition.\n\nMeta\n\nZuckerberg's email to Ebersman discussed the potential cost of acquiring mobile app companies like Instagram. He highlighted their large user base, rapid growth, small team size (10-25 employees), and lack of revenue at the time. Ebersman, who oversaw Facebook's IPO in May 2012, responded to these considerations.\n\nZuckerberg also stated, \"The businesses are still new, but their networks are well-established, and their brands already hold significance. If they expand on a large scale, they could pose a significant threat to us. These entrepreneurs aren't eager to sell (largely inspired by our success), but if the price is high enough -- like $500 million or $1 billion -- they might consider it...we're vulnerable in mobile...\"\n\nEbersman's response focused on the \"value creation\" such a merger or acquisition would bring to Facebook. He emphasized the potential benefits of integrating acquired products with Facebook's services to enhance overall offerings. However, he also stressed the importance of having a clear vision for implementation and considering cost-effective strategies such as internal product improvements.\n\nResponding to the leaked email gaining traction, Professor Paul Nary, a corporate strategy expert at The Wharton School, shared his thoughts on the micro-blogging platform, X (formerly Twitter).\n\n\"This seems to be, at the very least, a well-thought-out and cautious approach to making a deal,\" Nary commented on X.\n\nProfessor Nary shared his view, saying, \"It's an interesting idea, considering the concept of 'killer acquisitions' of rivals... or maybe something similar but not quite? Is integrating and absorbing different from outright elimination? There are various perspectives on this spectrum.\"\n\nFrom a mergers and acquisitions standpoint, Zuckerberg's confidence was well-placed, turning what was initially seen as a hefty price tag into one of the most celebrated deals in the tech world. The Facebook founder saw the potential of Instagram's growing user base to reshape, or even disrupt, the social media landscape. This strategic decision emphasizes the importance of focusing on long-term growth and innovation rather than short-term gains.\n\nSince Facebook acquired Instagram in 2012, its user base has soared from 30 million to over 2 billion monthly active users globally (as of January 2024), surpassing platforms like TikTok and WeChat, according to Statista. In terms of revenue, Instagram contributed nearly 30% of Meta's revenue in the first half of 2022, as reported by Bloomberg. Meta listed Instagram's ad revenue as $22 billion in 2020 and $17.9 billion in 2019.", "source": {"uri": "indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IndiaTimes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_video_platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online video platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Democratic_National_Committee_email_leak", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 Democratic National Committee email leak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mergers and acquisitions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wharton_School", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wharton School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_users", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Active users"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WeChat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statista", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statista"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microblogging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategic_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategic Management", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://im.indiatimes.in/content/2024/Apr/insta_6625dad097774.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9505735", "eventUri": "eng-9505735", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-05-", "textStart": 1067, "textEnd": 1075}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 77, "relevance": 1}

The Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index -- measures how much consumers are spending on goods and services.\n\nThis will be the final data on inflation before the Federal Reserve makes its next decision on interest rates on May first. Markets are pricing in a 96 percent chance that the central bank holds rates steady.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of Meta (META) fell sharply after the company announced higher than expected spending on artificial intelligence in its first-quarter earnings report. The tech giant said it expects to spend anywhere between $35 and $40 billion in the coming year, up from previous estimates of 30-37 billion, driven heavily by investments in AI.\n\nOn an earnings call with investors, CEO Mark Zuckerberg doubled down on AI saying Meta wants to be the leading AI company in the world, adding that the company needs to increase spending meaningfully before expecting to generate revenue in AI.\n\nThese comments spooked investors and threatened to wipe almost 163 billion dollars off its market value.\n\nThis all comes roughly a week after Meta deployed its AI assistant on Instagram and Facebook.

The social media specialist's report included upbeat data about Q1 itself. Revenue and earnings per share (EPS), for instance, both came in ahead of analysts' average forecasts. But it also raised potential issues related to cost control and profitability going forward.\n\nData source: Meta Platforms. Analyst source: FactSet via Xignite. YOY = Year over year.\n\nMeta Platforms, previously known as Facebook, stands at the forefront of social media and technology. It owns a suite of apps that billions globally use to connect, share, and discover. Beyond social media, Meta is diving deep into the development of the metaverse, a virtual realm for users to interact in virtual reality spaces.\n\nMeta's core business still relies heavily on advertising. The sustained growth in ad revenue highlights the robust demand for Meta's advertising solutions. This revenue fuels the company's strategic bets on the metaverse as well as its growing efforts related to artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nDuring the quarter, Meta Platforms made significant strides in enhancing user engagement across its app family. The launch of new AI-driven features and the optimization of ad delivery mechanisms contributed to a noticeable increase in ad impressions (up 20% year over year) and the average price per ad (up 6%). This dual achievement demonstrates Meta's adeptness at both expanding its advertising reach and ensuring the value of its ad inventory grows.\n\nMeta's balance sheet remains strong, with substantial cash flow to support its ambitious projects. Building out a metaverse to help shape the future of digital interaction is one ambitious project Meta is investing heavily in. It's leveraging virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies as part of this effort. However, this venture from its Reality Labs segment has yet to turn a profit, and it generated $3.85 billion in operating losses just in Q1.\n\nEscalating regulatory pressures, particularly in the European Union and the United States, are also pressuring Meta's balance sheet. Total costs and expenses in Q1 were $22.64 billion, an increase of 6% year over year. Addressing these regulatory hurdles is pivotal for maintaining its growth trajectory.\n\nLooking forward, Meta Platforms management expressed a cautiously optimistic outlook but it also guided for increased costs.

The social media specialist's report included upbeat data about Q1 itself. Revenue and earnings per share (EPS), for instance, both came in ahead of analysts' average forecasts. But it also raised potential issues related to cost control and profitability going forward.\n\nData source: Meta Platforms. Analyst source: FactSet via Xignite. YOY = Year over year.\n\nMeta Platforms, previously known as Facebook, stands at the forefront of social media and technology. It owns a suite of apps that billions globally use to connect, share, and discover. Beyond social media, Meta is diving deep into the development of the metaverse, a virtual realm for users to interact in virtual reality spaces.\n\nMeta's core business still relies heavily on advertising. The sustained growth in ad revenue highlights the robust demand for Meta's advertising solutions. This revenue fuels the company's strategic bets on the metaverse as well as its growing efforts related to artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nDuring the quarter, Meta Platforms made significant strides in enhancing user engagement across its app family. The launch of new AI-driven features and the optimization of ad delivery mechanisms contributed to a noticeable increase in ad impressions (up 20% year over year) and the average price per ad (up 6%). This dual achievement demonstrates Meta's adeptness at both expanding its advertising reach and ensuring the value of its ad inventory grows.\n\nMeta's balance sheet remains strong, with substantial cash flow to support its ambitious projects. Building out a metaverse to help shape the future of digital interaction is one ambitious project Meta is investing heavily in. It's leveraging virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies as part of this effort. However, this venture from its Reality Labs segment has yet to turn a profit, and it generated $3.85 billion in operating losses just in Q1.\n\nEscalating regulatory pressures, particularly in the European Union and the United States, are also pressuring Meta's balance sheet. Total costs and expenses in Q1 were $22.64 billion, an increase of 6% year over year. Addressing these regulatory hurdles is pivotal for maintaining its growth trajectory.\n\nLooking forward, Meta Platforms management expressed a cautiously optimistic outlook but it also guided for increased costs. The heavy emphasis on spending to build out metaverse and AI projects indicates that Meta is not shying away from its long-term visions, despite short-term profitability challenges. Management anticipates full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35 billion to 40 billion, an increase from prior projections of $30 billion to $37 billion in costs. Meta expects capital expenditures will continue to increase in 2025 as it funds some ambitious AI research and product development efforts.\n\nThese strategically vital areas are expected to lay the groundwork for Meta's future growth and market position. Investors and analysts will be watching closely to see how Meta balances these investments with the need for operational efficiency and profitability.\n\nMeta Platforms finds itself at a critical juncture. On one hand, there's the promise of the metaverse and AI reshaping how people connect and interact. On the other, there are present challenges of regulatory scrutiny and the need for substantial investment in these new technologies.

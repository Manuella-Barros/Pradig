It was no different when the filmmaker-choreographer sat down for a meal with actor Anil Kapoor, his sister-in-law Maheep Kapoor, and Arbaaz Khan: they ended up discussing the diets of superstars Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan. In a snippet going viral from Star vs Food Season 2 (2021), Farah said: \"Salman Khan eats everything but SRK only eats Tandoori Chicken. Despite Salman's physique, I have seen him eat rice, biryani, chole. He eats everything. But no roti, no rice for Shah Rukh. I have never seen him eat bread.\" Adding, the Fighter actor said: \"Even when I was shooting for Trimurti alongside him, I noticed that he only takes one serving. There is no second serving. I don't know why..\" Interestingly, a follower named Balwant Dhaliwal also shared an encounter with the Pathaan actor, stating that he just ate Tandoori Chicken Tikka. \"Yup, still remembered that when King Khan was in Malacca (Malaysia) shooting for Don 2, we catered for him and the film crew. His menu was just (tandoori) chicken tikka for lunch and dinner.\" But is a diet consisting of only tandoori chicken good for health? From a medical standpoint, a diet consisting solely of tandoori chicken, excluding grains, bread, and other carbohydrates without any second servings, offers a mix of benefits and drawbacks, said Neelima Bisht, chief clinical nutrition, dietetics department at Paras Health, Gurugram. \"The high protein intake from tandoori chicken can support muscle maintenance, boost metabolism, and increase feelings of fullness, which may aid in weight management and stabilise blood sugar levels,\" said Bisht. However, the restrictive nature of this diet poses significant risks. \"The absence of grains, fruits, and vegetables can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients such as fibre, vitamins, and minerals, which are crucial for overall health. This lack of dietary variety can negatively impact digestive health, leading to constipation and other gastrointestinal issues, and may also affect heart and kidney function if not balanced properly,\" said Bisht. Moreover, the monotony of consuming only tandoori chicken can lead to \"feelings of deprivation, making long-term adherence challenging and potentially affecting mental well-being\". \"To mitigate these risks, it's important to incorporate a variety of food groups, consider nutritional supplementation, and have regular health check-ups. Working with a healthcare provider or dietitian can help create a more balanced meal plan that meets individual health needs and goals,\" said Bisht.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/food-wine/when-farah-khan-anil-kapoor-shah-rukh-khan-diet-chicken-tikka-no-roti-benefits-health-risks-9358598/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/shah-rukh-khan_1600_pooja-dadlani_insta.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:12:08", "author": "Lifestyle Desk", "authors": ["Lifestyle Desk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.115}

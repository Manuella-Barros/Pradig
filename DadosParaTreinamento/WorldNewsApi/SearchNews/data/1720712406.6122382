The shamed presenter stepped down from his position last year after a shocking revelation, where he confessed to an \"unwise, but not illegal\" relationship with a past colleague. After a year-long hiatus from social media, the 62 year old former host of Dancing on Ice made a return to his social media last month, delighting fans with photos of his beloved dog Alfie. Just this weekend, he posted another picture of his pet in his lounge, quipping: \"Not sure where rug ends and Alfie begins! ! \" His post quickly attracted comments from amused fans, with one asking: \"Where's Wally? \" It appears that Phillip has also regained the confidence of his former This Morning colleague Alison Hammond, 49, who showed her approval by liking his post, the Mirror reports. These developments occur against a backdrop of disappointing ratings for This Morning, as audiences tune out after the departure of popular hosts Phillip and Holly Willoughby. In March, it was revealed that Ben Shephard and Cat Deeley would take over, but they are said to have \"failed to connect with audiences.\" Reportedly, viewership has plummeted in the past couple of months, prompting \"crisis talks\" among executives and leading to job cuts across the network. The viewing figures initially looked promising, but interest has waned, with peak viewership in May plummeting to 589,000 and an average of 486,000, The Sun reports. A spokesperson for This Morning defended the show's performance to The Mirror: \"Ben and Cat have recorded the best audience reach of the year so far on This Morning with 4.5 million viewers across one week.\" Yet, there's talk that Phillip Schofield's return could give the show a much-needed lift. PR and crisis management specialist Ed weighed in on the matter with The Mirror, saying: \"Schofield has always proven himself to be popular. He's now proven himself to be flexible and disciplined. \"Attributes that will be absolutely crucial for the likes of ITV in the years ahead, and attributes that ITV showed a total lack of in the way that they handled the initial scandal. To put it simply: ITV needs Schofield a whole lot more than Schofield needs ITV.\" Get the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

{"id": 243376644, "title": "Official: Ukrainian Drone Kills 5 In Russian Border Town", "text": "Early results in Iran\u2019s presidential election showed reformist lawmaker Masud Pezeshkian holding a narrow, but growing lead over three other contenders, as Iranians waited for a final tally in a vote unlikely to result in major policy shifts. The election commission tally released late morning on June 29 showed Pezeshkian garnering 43.5 percent of the vote, ahead of hard-line former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, who had 37.7 percent. Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, a conservative former speaker of parliament, trailed with 14 percent. The fourth approved candidate in the running, Mostafa Purmohammadi, a former justice and interior minister, was well behind, with less than a percentage point of votes cast. If no candidate secures a majority in the first round, a runoff between the top two vote-getters will be held July 5. All four candidates were vetted and approved by the Guardians Council, an unelected constitutional watchdog whose members are directly and indirectly appointed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The outcome of the election is unlikely to result in major policy shifts, but it could affect the succession to the 85-year-old Khamenei, who has been the country\u2019s supreme leader since 1989. Last-ditch efforts to rally behind a consensus conservatives candidate failed on the eve of the election, with neither Qalibaf nor Jalili willing to drop out in favor of the other. Conservatives have expressed concern that the lack of unity could split the vote to the benefit of reformist Pezeshkian. Qalibaf is a former commander of the air wing of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and is the longest-serving mayor of Tehran. He is a traditional conservative who is running for president for the fourth time in the past 20 years. Over his career, he\u2019s has been dogged by corruption allegations, though none has dented his relationship with Khamenei. Jalili, who has never held elected office, serves as Khamenei\u2019s personal representative on the Supreme National Security Council. During his 2007-13 term as the council\u2019s secretary, he led the a delegation in failed talks with the West on Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. Pezeshkian has been a member of parliament since 2008 and served as deputy speaker from 2016 to 2020, when moderates and reformists had a majority in the legislature. He has questioned Iran\u2019s methods of enforcing the hijab, the Islamic head scarf for women, and spoken in favor of negotiating with the West. But he has said he will follow Khamenei\u2019s policies if elected. Opinion polls projected a slightly higher voter participation than in the last presidential vote in 2021, which saw a record-low turnout. Critics say the real number was likely even lower. WATCH: Speaking with RFE/RL's Radio Farda from inside Iran, some listeners said they would boycott the vote, while others said they hoped their participation would bring about reforms. Khamenei encouraged Iranians to vote as he cast his ballot shortly after the polls opened. \"We encourage our dear people to take the issue of voting seriously and participate,\" he said. Dissidents at home and abroad called for a boycott, arguing that past voting has failed to deliver change. Iran\u2019s political establishment has long maintained it derives its legitimacy from strong voter turnout, but poor participation in recent elections and popular protests have challenged the legitimacy of the current leadership. Iran\u2019s supreme leader has the final say on all state matters and the president does not have much sway on many key issues. Raisi died along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and several other officials when their helicopter crashed on May 19. Many Iranians refer to him as the Butcher of Tehran for his alleged role in the mass execution of political prisoners in 1988 when he was Tehran's deputy prosecutor.

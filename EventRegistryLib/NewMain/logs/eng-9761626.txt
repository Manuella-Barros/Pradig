There is a true and significant cost to taxpayers,\" Gloria said in a recent interview with NBC 7.\n\nWhile Turner revealed some details for his plan to address homelessness in the veteran community, he acknowledges the plan coming to fruition largely relies on his electoral results.\n\n\"I'm positive that when I'm mayor that will happen.

I mean this is where I want to teach,\" said Turner.\n\nAs he led Austin-East High School to their first state championship in 1977, the basketball never stopped bouncing as he went to Ole Miss. After his stand out college career in 1981, he was selected by the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA Draft. The star played eight years in the NBA for the Mavericks, Denver Nuggets, and Chicago Bulls. Turner takes the life lessons of the game and teaches it to the younger generation.\n\n\"When I look at the kids here, I see myself,\" said Turner. For the Roadrunner, his home holds a special place in his heart as he has hosted the basketball camp at the high school for more than 35 years.\n\n\"You carry your hometown with your wherever; you carry your high school wherever you go,\" said Turner.\n\nThe goal behind the camp remains consistent as he wants to be a helping hand for the next generation.\n\n\"Just the interaction is really beautiful to me, and I am hoping all the kids realize that, 'Hey, I came from the same area they did',\" said Turner.\n\nAs he has held this camp for decades, he has seen the athletes come and go, watching generations pass by.\n\nFor one athlete, he said that she gets to watch the camp.\n\n\"Young lady that is security now? She was in my camp. My nephew who just turned 51 - he was in my camp,\" said Turner.\n\nMike Kirby, one player's grandpa, did not want to miss a basket as he has watched his grandson throughout the camp.\n\n\"I have been here all of the first two days,\" said Kirby.\n\nHe said this camp is more than just basketball lessons as he hopes his grandson takes away the entire experience.\n\n\"The stuff that is outside of the drills, that's what I want him to really take him away.

He insisted that there was no military solution to the war, adding that \u201cin the battlefield there are only death and destruction\u201d. But \u201cas long as we are in government in Hungary, we will not allow a single Hungarian to be taken to the Ukraine-Russia front \u2026 we firmly protest against introducing mandatory conscription in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThe road to peace starts with a ceasefire with peace talks to follow,\u201d he said, and asked Belarus to \u201cdo everything to ensure that the war, suffering, and senseless killing end in Ukraine and we all can again live in peace in the region,\u201d he said. The re-emergence of blocs in the world poses a \u201cserious long-term risk\u201d he said, adding that it went against Hungary\u2019s interests. \u201cWe want the world to make steps towards connectivity and international cooperation \u2026 we think that we need as few sanctions as possible and as much cooperation as possible,\u201d he added. The Hungarian government wants to develop its cooperation with Belarus in all areas that are not affected by the EU\u2019s sanctions against Russia, he said, adding that Belarus was also ready to cooperate. He also noted that he was accompanied by representatives of 24 Hungarian companies on his visit, and added that the delegation was set to have 92 bilateral talks while in Minsk. Last year Hungarian companies exported nearly 10 million hatching eggs to Belarus, followed by several hundreds of thousands of baby chicken this year, Szijjarto said. He also noted two Hungarian companies being among the 20 companies with the largest pharmaceutical market share in that country. Szijjarto referred to Belarus as \u201can extremely important factor\u201d to Hungary\u2019s energy security, noting that 80 percent of Hungary\u2019s crude oil supplies came through Belarus, with a total of 4.5 million tonnes last year and nearly 2 million tonnes delivered already since the beginning of 2024. Secure oil supplies to Hungary \u201cwould be impossible without the Druzhba pipeline \u2026 for physical reasons \u2026 oil can only be shipped through pipes,\u201d Szijjarto said. He noted that \u201cno other pipe of such capacity comes to Hungary\u201d and added that Croatia had \u201craised the transit fee for rather than the capacity of their own pipeline.\u201d Hungary and Belarus have signed a nuclear energy cooperation deal under which \u201cBelarusian experience could be used in (Hungary\u2019s) Paks upgrade project,\u201d Szijjarto said. \u201cI hope that Belarus\u2019s companies would soon join US, German, and French companies that are currently working at the Paks nuclear plant construction as partners of Rosatom,\u201d the minister said. On another subject, Szijjarto said in the next sports season Hungary would continue to offer an opportunity for Belarusian sports teams to play their matches in Hungary \u201cjust as it had done in the case of Israel and Ukraine.\u201d He noted that Israel\u2019s national football team, the Ukrainian handball team and Belarusian teams had played cup matches in Hungary in the past season. The Hungarian government is against \u201cmixing up geopolitics and sports\u201d and \u201cwe are also against political factors determining who is allowed to compete in the Olympic Games and who is not,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, addressing a Hungary-Belarus business forum, Szijjarto reiterated the Hungarian government\u2019s aim to develop cooperation with Belarus in all areas not affected by EU sanctions. \u201cWe Hungarians do not believe in a policy of sanctions. That policy, in our experience over the past two and a half years, has failed, caused enormous damage, and more to European economies than to the Russian,\u201d the ministry quoted Szijjarto as saying. He noted that bilateral trade totalled 142 million euros last year and has already grown by an annual 20 percent so far this year. Company leaders in the delegation he is heading represent the food, agriculture, pharmaceutical, construction and machinery sectors, the minister said. Szijjarto said that the Hungarian government will continue to allow Belarussian nationals to obtain a Hungarian visa without restrictions, adding that \u201cwe will not accept any sort of pressure on the matter\u201d. Citizens of Belarus can apply for a visa in eight cities, he added. Speaking about cooperation in education, the minister mentioned the government scheme ensuring 50 yearly grants for Belarussian students studying at a Hungarian university.", "summary": "<p>You must be logged into the site to view this content.</p>", "url": "https://www.budapesttimes.hu/world/szijjarto-hungary-shocked-by-statements-threatening-escalation-of-war/", "image": "https://www.budapesttimes.hu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/szijjarto_05_facebook.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:20:01", "author": "Attila Leitner", "authors": ["Attila Leitner"], "language": "en", "source_country": "hu", "sentiment": -0.049}

Together, they met with lawmakers across the political spectrum, including members of the Congressional Black Caucus, to push for minority representation in the luxury spirits industry.\n\nJackson met with leaders from both political parties, including House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, and described the meetings as positive.\n\n\"My experience here has been great,\" said Jackson at a press conference on the Hill. \"I went to talk to them about economic opportunities for everybody, and it's really exciting.

A lot | Fact check\n\nJackson's advocacy comes in the wake of an ongoing legal dispute with Suntory Global Spirits. In an Instagram post on Wednesday, Jackson highlighted his concerns: \"I'm off to DC to talk to the Congressional Black Caucus about how Suntory Global has damaged my business.\"\n\nSuntory Global has denied any wrongdoing in the matter.\n\nCrump, a prominent advocate for Black rights, emphasized the broader significance of their mission. \"We are committed to helping Mr. Jackson demonstrate the true 'power' of not just his television acumen, but also the power of the consumers to make corporate America allow a seat at the table for hard-working Black entrepreneurs.\"\n\nDespite the substantial contributions of minority consumers to the liquor market, there remains a significant gap in ownership and leadership roles. As reported in the Independent, a 2022 study revealed that while Black Americans make up 12% of the consumer base, they hold only 2% of executive positions in the industry.\n\nJeremy Yurow is a politics reporting fellow based in Hawaii for the USA TODAY Network.

He was joined by civil rights attorney Ben Crump during his surprise visit, where the two spoke to lawmakers about how they could potentially bridge the wealth gap and carve out more space for Black-owned spirits companies.\n\n\"Mr. Jackson is one of the most successful Black entrepreneurs in America,\" Crump said, per the outlet. \"We're here today to talk about how he's trying to knock down barriers of equal access and equal opportunity to have a seat at the table in all industries.\"\n\nPer USA Today, while addressing a Capitol Hill crowd, 50 Cent said, \"This is really exciting for me. I got a chance to meet with both sides today, and it feels really good.\"\n\nHe added of representatives in Washington, \"They don't agree on a lot of stuff, and so to get them to agree on seeing me was an accomplishment in itself.\"\n\nFollowing his visit, 50 Cent also said, \"My experience here has been great. I went to talk to them about economic opportunities for everybody, and it's really exciting. The response I got makes me feel that there's bright days ahead of us.\"\n\n50 Cent is a longtime businessman who's invested in several ventures across television, film, video games, book publishing, fashion, the liquor industry and more over the years. The rap star, who owns Sire Spirits, has been involved in an ongoing legal battle with Suntory Global Spirits -- one of the world's largest producers of alcoholic beverages -- after alleging that the liquor producer was complicit in an embezzlement scheme that nearly cost him his brand millions of dollars, per documents previously obtained by PEOPLE.\n\nHours before his Capitol Hill trip, 50 Cent wrote on X, \"I'm off to DC \ud83d\udeebto talk to the Congressional Black Caucus about how @SuntoryGlobal has damaged my business \"#TheyLackHonor.\"\n\nIn another X post, the BMF producer added, \"You can change your name from Beam Suntory to Suntory Global spirits but you still robbed him \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u2642\ufe0fI just want mines. Tell your friends in your DISCUS meeting, you haven't been under compliance at all.\"\n\nIn March, 50 Cent posted a clip of a FOX 5 NY report about Suntory Global Spirits' (formerly known as Beam Suntory) allegations on Instagram, telling the company that it's \"gonna pay for what they did trust me.\"\n\n\"These big companies think they can get away with anything,\" he continued in a caption. \"It has cost me millions in legal fees. They are gonna find out I'm not the one you want to play with.\"\n\nIn his court filing, 50 Cent claimed that his brand, Sire Spirits, overpaid for the liquor supplied by Suntory Global Spirits and that the company took kickbacks of about $6 million. The liquor producer \"vehemently\" denied \"all allegations of wrongdoing\" in an email statement sent to PEOPLE on March 12.\n\n\"[Suntory Global Spirits] had no involvement in or knowledge of the fraudulent activity alleged in the complaint, and any allegation to the contrary has no basis in fact,\" it said. \"It is undisputed that we honored all prior obligations to Mr. Jackson and Sire Spirits, and it is very unfortunate that the parties involved continue to misrepresent the facts and misdirect blame in an attempt to recover fees and damages.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com",

Mr. Jackson's journey has been a testament to how much a determined individual can succeed through hard work and vision, and yet he still must contend with the oppression that comes from being a minority business owner.\"\n\n\"We are committed to helping Mr. Jackson demonstrate the true 'power' of not just his television acumen, but also the power of the consumers to make corporate America allow a seat at the table for hard-working Black entrepreneurs,\" Crump added.\n\n50 Cent has been embroiled in a bitter legal battle with Beam Suntory over allegations that senior employees of the company embezzled millions of dollars from his Sire Spirits brand through unpaid invoices.\n\nSuntory is one of the world's largest spirits companies and owns Branson Cognac, which distributes Sire Spirits.\n\nAD\n\nAD LOADING...\n\nThe two parties headed to mediation last summer but it appears a resolution has yet to be reached as the G-Unit rapper has continued to attack the drinks giant on social media.\n\nIn a scathing Instagram post in March, Fif warned Beam Suntory that he will make them \"pay for what they did.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD LOADING...\n\n\"These big companies think they can get away with anything. It has cost me millions in legal fees. They are gonna find out I'm not the one you want to play with,\" he wrote.\n\nHe added: \"I'm not the guy you want to get started. In nicest way I'm gonna need my money by Monday.\"\n\nBeam Suntory has denied the accusations, saying: \"It had no involvement in or knowledge of the fraudulent activity alleged in the complaint, and any allegation to the contrary has no basis in fact.\n\n\"It is undisputed that we honored all prior obligations to Mr. Jackson and Sire Spirits, and it is very unfortunate that the parties involved continue to misrepresent the facts and misdirect blame in an attempt to recover fees and damages.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD LOADING...\n\nSire Spirits attorney Craig Weiner refuted this statement, responding: \"Because these illicit commissions were baked into the price of the product, Sire Spirits overpaid on taxes, overpaid on customs and duties, overpaid on insurance, which are marked towards the value of the product.\n\n\"Beam Suntory's role here is extraordinarily troubling. Beam Suntory's Chief Commercial Officer, a gentleman by the name of Julious Grant, acting as an employee, as an officer of the company, acting under the actual and parent authority of Beam Suntory facilitated the entire fraud as we plead in our complaint.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD LOADING...\n\nWeiner added: \"I question where was your compliance program? How did they get away with Mr. Grant receiving payments under the scheme for years and years. Where were you? How did you allow this to happen? This is a heavily regulated industry.\"", "source": {"uri": "hiphopdx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HipHopDX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "will_schube@hiphopdx.com", "name": "Will Schube", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sire_Records", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sire Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_Suntory", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beam Suntory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Breonna_Taylor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Killing of Breonna Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trayvon_Martin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trayvon Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Crump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Crump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-Unit", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "G-Unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suntory", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suntory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embezzlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Embezzlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognac", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cognac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

('Denison' or the 'Company') (TSX: DML) (NYSE American: DNN) today filed its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion & Analysis ('MD&A') for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Both documents will be available on the Company's website at www.denisonmines.com, SEDAR+ (at www.sedarplus.ca) and EDGAR (at www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml). The highlights provided below are derived from these documents and should be read in conjunction with them. All amounts in this release are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated. View PDF\n\nDavid Cates, President and CEO of Denison commented, \"This year, Denison commemorates its 70th year of uranium mining, exploration, and development. Denison's long history in uranium mining has been characterized by strategic vision, technological advancement, and an entrepreneurial drive to accomplish things others thought impossible. Modern Denison's defining moment can be traced to a decision, from approximately 15-years ago, to reposition the Company away from a high-cost global expansion platform to focus on the exploration and development of high-grade uranium deposits in the Athabasca Basin region of northern Saskatchewan. This strategy built on Denison's discovery of the Phoenix deposit in 2008 and demonstrated a steadfast conviction that uranium and nuclear energy would be recognized as an essential source of baseload power generation in the long-run - offering an unrivaled combination of emission-free energy and energy security.\n\nOur tireless efforts to advance the Company's strategy, and complete technical evaluations of our flagship Wheeler River project, led to the bold selection of the In-Situ Recovery ('ISR') mining method for the Phoenix deposit in 2018, and have put us in a position where we are nearing a final investment decision to proceed with the construction of potentially one of the lowest-cost uranium mines in the world. In Q1'2024 we made several important steps towards this objective, including the transition from Front-End Engineering Design to detailed design, and the exclusive acquisition of MaxPERF tooling systems, which are expected to support our industry leading deployment of the low-cost ISR mining method in the Athabasca Basin.\n\nDenison's portfolio of uranium reserves, resources, and physical holdings has greatly appreciated in value through late 2023 and into early 2024, as positive sentiment in the uranium and nuclear energy markets has sustained and uranium prices have rapidly increased. As Denison has avoided entering low-priced uranium supply contracts in recent years and has held its physical uranium investment to support future project financing efforts for Phoenix, we are now in an enviable spot with significant uncommitted uranium production and physical holdings potentially available to the market at time of expected scarcity. Taken together with continued geopolitical instability and the expected emergence of significant additional demand from new nuclear builds, it is an ideal time for our Company to be readying to build a low-cost Saskatchewan-based uranium mine.\n\nAs we celebrate Denison's legacy of uranium mining in 2024, we look forward to marking this year with several additional notable milestones from our exciting portfolio of Saskatchewan-based uranium mining, exploration, and development projects.\"\n\nDenison Mines Corp. was formed under the laws of Ontario and is a reporting issuer in all Canadian provinces and territories. Denison's common shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the 'TSX') under the symbol 'DML' and on the NYSE American exchange under the symbol 'DNN'.\n\nDenison is a uranium mining, exploration and development company with interests focused in the Athabasca Basin region of northern Saskatchewan, Canada. The Company has an effective 95% interest in its flagship Wheeler River Uranium Project, which is the largest undeveloped uranium project in the infrastructure rich eastern portion of the Athabasca Basin region of northern Saskatchewan. In mid-2023, the Phoenix FS was completed for the Phoenix deposit as an ISR mining operation, and an update to the previously prepared 2018 Pre-Feasibility Study ('PFS') was completed for Wheeler River's Gryphon deposit as a conventional underground mining operation. Based on the respective studies, both deposits have the potential to be competitive with the lowest cost uranium mining operations in the world. Permitting efforts for the planned Phoenix ISR operation commenced in 2019 and have advanced significantly, with licensing in progress and a draft Environmental Impact Study ('EIS') submitted for regulatory and public review in October 2022.\n\nDenison's interests in Saskatchewan also include a 22.5% ownership interest in the McClean Lake Joint Venture ('MLJV'), which includes unmined uranium deposits (planned for extraction via the MLJV's SABRE mining method starting in 2025) and the McClean Lake uranium mill (currently utilizing a portion of its licensed capacity to process the ore from the Cigar Lake mine under a toll milling agreement), plus a 25.17% interest in the Midwest Joint Venture ('MWJV')'s Midwest Main and Midwest A deposits, and a 69.35% interest in the Tthe Heldeth T\u00fa\u00e9 ('THT') and Huskie deposits on the Waterbury Lake Property ('Waterbury'). The Midwest Main, Midwest A, THT and Huskie deposits are located within 20 kilometres of the McClean Lake mill. Taken together, the Company has direct ownership interests in properties covering ~384,000 hectares in the Athabasca Basin region.\n\nAdditionally, through its 50% ownership of JCU (Canada) Exploration Company, Limited ('JCU'), Denison holds additional interests in various uranium project joint ventures in Canada, including the Millennium project (JCU, 30.099%), the Kiggavik project (JCU, 33.8118%) and Christie Lake (JCU, 34.4508%).\n\nIn 2024, Denison is celebrating its 70 year in uranium mining, exploration, and development, which began in 1954 with Denison's first acquisition of mining claims in the Elliot Lake region of northern Ontario.\n\nThe technical information contained in this press release has been reviewed and approved by Chad Sorba, P.Geo., Denison's Vice President Technical Services & Project Evaluation, and Andy Yackulic, P.Geo., Denison's Vice President Exploration, who are both Qualified Persons in accordance with the requirements of NI 43-101.\n\nCertain information contained in this press release constitutes 'forward-looking information', within the meaning of the applicable United States and Canadian legislation concerning the business, operations and financial performance and condition of Denison.

The Russian assault in Ukraine continues to upend the \"where\" and \"how\" of attaining nuclear fuel -- and it has also motivated U.S. legislators to act.\n\nTwo years into the Russian war with Ukraine, things are different. The Inflation Reduction Act was passed in 2022, authorizing $700 million in funding to support production of high-\u00adassay low-enriched uranium in the United States. Meanwhile, the Department of Energy this January issued a $500 million request for proposals to stimulate new HALEU production. The Emergency National Security Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2024 includes $2.7 billion in funding for new uranium enrichment production.

('Denison' or the 'Company') (TSX: DML) (NYSE American: DNN) today filed its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion & Analysis ('MD&A') for the quarter ended .

View PDF\n\n, President and CEO of Denison commented, \"This year, Denison commemorates its 70th year of uranium mining, exploration, and development. Denison's long history in uranium mining has been characterized by strategic vision, technological advancement, and an entrepreneurial drive to accomplish things others thought impossible. Modern Denison's defining moment can be traced to a decision, from approximately 15-years ago, to reposition the Company away from a high-cost global expansion platform to focus on the exploration and development of high-grade uranium deposits in the region of northern Saskatchewan. This strategy built on Denison's discovery of the deposit in 2008 and demonstrated a steadfast conviction that uranium and nuclear energy would be recognized as an essential source of baseload power generation in the long-run \" offering an unrivaled combination of emission-free energy and energy security.\n\nOur tireless efforts to advance the Company's strategy, and complete technical evaluations of our flagship project, led to the bold selection of the In-Situ Recovery ('ISR') mining method for the deposit in 2018, and have put us in a position where we are nearing a final investment decision to proceed with the construction of potentially one of the lowest-cost uranium mines in the world. In Q1'2024 we made several important steps towards this objective, including the transition from Front-End Engineering Design to detailed design, and the exclusive acquisition of MaxPERF tooling systems, which are expected to support our industry leading deployment of the low-cost ISR mining method in the .\n\nDenison's portfolio of uranium reserves, resources, and physical holdings has greatly appreciated in value through late 2023 and into early 2024, as positive sentiment in the uranium and nuclear energy markets has sustained and uranium prices have rapidly increased. As Denison has avoided entering low-priced uranium supply contracts in recent years and has held its physical uranium investment to support future project financing efforts for , we are now in an enviable spot with significant uncommitted uranium production and physical holdings potentially available to the market at time of expected scarcity. Taken together with continued geopolitical instability and the expected emergence of significant additional demand from new nuclear builds, it is an ideal time for our Company to be readying to build a low-cost -based uranium mine.\n\nAs we celebrate Denison's legacy of uranium mining in 2024, we look forward to marking this year with several additional notable milestones from our exciting portfolio of -based uranium mining, exploration, and development projects.\"\n\nDenison Mines Corp. was formed under the laws of and is a reporting issuer in all Canadian provinces and territories. Denison's common shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the 'TSX') under the symbol 'DML' and on the NYSE American exchange under the symbol 'DNN'.\n\nDenison is a uranium mining, exploration and development company with interests focused in the region of northern . The Company has an effective 95% interest in its flagship Wheeler River Uranium Project, which is the largest undeveloped uranium project in the infrastructure rich eastern portion of the region of northern . In mid-2023, the Phoenix FS was completed for the deposit as an ISR mining operation, and an update to the previously prepared 2018 Pre-Feasibility Study ('PFS') was completed for Wheeler River's Gryphon deposit as a conventional underground mining operation. Based on the respective studies, both deposits have the potential to be competitive with the lowest cost uranium mining operations in the world. Permitting efforts for the planned Phoenix ISR operation commenced in 2019 and have advanced significantly, with licensing in progress and a draft Environmental Impact Study ('EIS') submitted for regulatory and public review in .\n\nDenison's interests in also include a 22.5% ownership interest in the McClean Lake Joint Venture ('MLJV'), which includes unmined uranium deposits (planned for extraction via the MLJV's SABRE mining method starting in 2025) and the uranium mill (currently utilizing a portion of its licensed capacity to process the ore from the mine under a toll milling agreement), plus a 25.17% interest in the Midwest Joint Venture ('MWJV')'s Midwest Main and Midwest A deposits, and a 69.35% interest in the Tthe Heldeth T\u00c3\u00ba\u00c3\u00a9 ('THT') and Huskie deposits on the Waterbury ('Waterbury'). The Midwest Main, Midwest A, THT and Huskie deposits are located within 20 kilometres of the mill. Taken together, the Company has direct ownership interests in properties covering ~384,000 hectares in the region.\n\nAdditionally, through its 50% ownership of JCU (Canada) Exploration Company, Limited ('JCU'), Denison holds additional interests in various uranium project joint ventures in , including the Millennium project (JCU, 30.099%), the Kiggavik project (JCU, 33.8118%) and (JCU, 34.4508%).\n\nIn 2024, Denison is celebrating its 70 year in uranium mining, exploration, and development, which began in 1954 with Denison's first acquisition of mining claims in the region of northern .\n\nThe technical information contained in this press release has been reviewed and approved by , ., Denison's Vice President Technical Services & Project Evaluation, and , ., Denison's Vice President Exploration, who are both Qualified Persons in accordance with the requirements of NI 43-101.\n\nCertain information contained in this press release constitutes 'forward-looking information', within the meaning of the applicable and Canadian legislation concerning the business, operations and financial performance and condition of Denison.

He reportedly lifted the hold after news last week that the White House was considering executive action on the issue.\n\nAlso Read: US Lawmakers Vote To Ban Russian Uranium In Win For North American Miners\n\nThe ban would unlock $2.7 billion in spending on a domestic nuclear uranium conversion and enrichment supply chain that Congress approved this year.\n\nBecause that spending was contingent on a ban on Russian uranium, and because the ban had broad bipartisan support, uranium mining executives were expecting the measure to eventually pass.\n\nThe broad support comes as the United States is trying to deprive Moscow of funding for its war in Ukraine.\n\nThe death of Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny in an Arctic prison in February bolstered support for the ban.\n\n\"It puts a hell of a lot of pressure on it now,\" Paul Goranson, CEO of enCore Energy Corp. (NASDAQ:EU), told Benzinga in March at the Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada conference and trade show.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine was bad enough, but Navalny's death caused the argument for banning Russian uranium to gain steam, Scott Melbye, CEO of Uranium Royalty Corp. (NASDAQ:UROY), told Benzinga at the show, a major mining event held annually in Toronto.\n\nEven without Navalny's death, there seemed to be a sense of inevitability about the ban among uranium executives at the show.\n\nEnergy Fuels Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN: UUUU) spokesman Curtis Moore told Benzinga at the show that there seemed to be some \"momentum growing\" for the ban and that he \"was starting to hear more buzz about the uranium ban coming into place.\"\n\n\"It feels like it was always going to pass,\" Amir Adnani, CEO of Uranium Energy Corp. (NYSEAMERICAN: UEC), told Benzinga at the show. \"The latest developments in Russia create that sense of urgency for the U.S. to be doing something.\"\n\nNow Read: EXCLUSIVE: Why This Uranium Bull Market Is Different -- 'We've Really Got To Start Developing Mines,' Says Madison Metals CEO\n\nBenzinga Mining is the bridge between mining companies and retail investors.

Martin Heinrich's Bipartisan Legislation To Ban Russian Uranium Passes Both Chambers Of Congress", "body": "WASHINGTON, D.C. -- U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) announced on Thursday the unanimous passage of his legislation in the Senate to ban imports of Russian uranium to the United States. The bill now heads to President Biden's desk to be signed into law.\n\nIn addition to Heinrich, the legislation was led in the Senate by U.S. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), and cosponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.).\n\nThe companion legislation previously passed the House of Representatives in December 2023 by voice vote.\n\n\"Banning imports of Russian uranium will strengthen our nation's energy security, reduce our reliance on Russia for nuclear fuels, and prevent American dollars from funding Vladimir Putin's unjustified war in Ukraine,\" said Heinrich, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \"Now that both chambers of Congress have passed this legislation, we will be able to shore up our nuclear fuel supply chain and invest in American producers like Urenco in Lea County, New Mexico.\"\n\n\"It is unconscionable for the United States of America, as the superpower of the world, to contribute to Vladimir Putin's ability to finance his unlawful war against Ukraine through our reliance on Russia for the uranium we need to power our nuclear reactors. I am proud to have worked on this legislation with Ranking Member Barrasso to put an end to Russian uranium imports, which simultaneously unlocks $2.72 billion to ramp up domestic uranium fuel production. Building on initiatives I worked to include in the Energy Act of 2020, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the Inflation Reduction Act, this legislation is one more critical step toward reshoring our nuclear supply chains,\" said Manchin, Chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n\n\"I have fought for years to end America's reliance on Russian nuclear fuel. Our efforts have finally paid off with passage of our bill to ban these imports once and for all,\" said Barrasso, Ranking Member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \"Wyoming has the uranium to replace Russian imports, and we're ready to use it. Our bipartisan legislation will help defund Russia's war machine, revive American uranium production, and jumpstart investments in America's nuclear fuel supply chain. This is a tremendous victory. I'm grateful to members of both parties for helping get this over the finish line.\"\n\n\"America's dangerous reliance on Russian enriched uranium must come to an end -- our national security depends on it,\" Risch said. \"With the passage of our legislation, America is taking an important step to spur uranium conversion and enrichment in the U.S., support advanced nuclear development and energy independence, and end Russian control of the global nuclear fuel supply chain.\"\n\n\"Wyoming's energy industry plays an integral role in powering not only our nation but the world,\" Lummis said. \"We should be capitalizing on Wyoming's vast resources and boosting domestic mining, not jeopardizing our national security. I am proud to join my friend and colleague Senator Barrasso to deliver a bipartisan solution to unleash American energy.\"\n\n\"Cutting off Russian uranium imports is one way we can disrupt Russia's war efforts in Ukraine while promoting investment in supply chains for American nuclear technology,\" Coons said. \"I'm glad that both chambers of Congress have passed this bipartisan bill that demonstrates our commitment to secure nuclear energy and increases our capacity for clean energy leadership around the world.\"", "source": {"uri": "ladailypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

('Denison' or the 'Company') (TSX: DML) (NYSE American: DNN) today filed its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion & Analysis ('MD&A') for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Both documents will be available on the Company's website at www.denisonmines.com, SEDAR+ (at www.sedarplus.ca) and EDGAR (at www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml). The highlights provided below are derived from these documents and should be read in conjunction with them. All amounts in this release are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated. View PDF\n\nDavid Cates, President and CEO of Denison commented, \"This year, Denison commemorates its 70th year of uranium mining, exploration, and development. Denison's long history in uranium mining has been characterized by strategic vision, technological advancement, and an entrepreneurial drive to accomplish things others thought impossible. Modern Denison's defining moment can be traced to a decision, from approximately 15-years ago, to reposition the Company away from a high-cost global expansion platform to focus on the exploration and development of high-grade uranium deposits in the Athabasca Basin region of northern Saskatchewan. This strategy built on Denison's discovery of the Phoenix deposit in 2008 and demonstrated a steadfast conviction that uranium and nuclear energy would be recognized as an essential source of baseload power generation in the long-run - offering an unrivaled combination of emission-free energy and energy security.\n\nOur tireless efforts to advance the Company's strategy, and complete technical evaluations of our flagship Wheeler River project, led to the bold selection of the In-Situ Recovery ('ISR') mining method for the Phoenix deposit in 2018, and have put us in a position where we are nearing a final investment decision to proceed with the construction of potentially one of the lowest-cost uranium mines in the world. In Q1'2024 we made several important steps towards this objective, including the transition from Front-End Engineering Design to detailed design, and the exclusive acquisition of MaxPERF tooling systems, which are expected to support our industry leading deployment of the low-cost ISR mining method in the Athabasca Basin.\n\nDenison's portfolio of uranium reserves, resources, and physical holdings has greatly appreciated in value through late 2023 and into early 2024, as positive sentiment in the uranium and nuclear energy markets has sustained and uranium prices have rapidly increased. As Denison has avoided entering low-priced uranium supply contracts in recent years and has held its physical uranium investment to support future project financing efforts for Phoenix, we are now in an enviable spot with significant uncommitted uranium production and physical holdings potentially available to the market at time of expected scarcity. Taken together with continued geopolitical instability and the expected emergence of significant additional demand from new nuclear builds, it is an ideal time for our Company to be readying to build a low-cost Saskatchewan-based uranium mine.\n\nAs we celebrate Denison's legacy of uranium mining in 2024, we look forward to marking this year with several additional notable milestones from our exciting portfolio of Saskatchewan-based uranium mining, exploration, and development projects.\"\n\nDenison Mines Corp. was formed under the laws of Ontario and is a reporting issuer in all Canadian provinces and territories. Denison's common shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the 'TSX') under the symbol 'DML' and on the NYSE American exchange under the symbol 'DNN'.\n\nDenison is a uranium mining, exploration and development company with interests focused in the Athabasca Basin region of northern Saskatchewan, Canada. The Company has an effective 95% interest in its flagship Wheeler River Uranium Project, which is the largest undeveloped uranium project in the infrastructure rich eastern portion of the Athabasca Basin region of northern Saskatchewan. In mid-2023, the Phoenix FS was completed for the Phoenix deposit as an ISR mining operation, and an update to the previously prepared 2018 Pre-Feasibility Study ('PFS') was completed for Wheeler River's Gryphon deposit as a conventional underground mining operation. Based on the respective studies, both deposits have the potential to be competitive with the lowest cost uranium mining operations in the world. Permitting efforts for the planned Phoenix ISR operation commenced in 2019 and have advanced significantly, with licensing in progress and a draft Environmental Impact Study ('EIS') submitted for regulatory and public review in October 2022.\n\nDenison's interests in Saskatchewan also include a 22.5% ownership interest in the McClean Lake Joint Venture ('MLJV'), which includes unmined uranium deposits (planned for extraction via the MLJV's SABRE mining method starting in 2025) and the McClean Lake uranium mill (currently utilizing a portion of its licensed capacity to process the ore from the Cigar Lake mine under a toll milling agreement), plus a 25.17% interest in the Midwest Joint Venture ('MWJV')'s Midwest Main and Midwest A deposits, and a 69.35% interest in the Tthe Heldeth T\u00fa\u00e9 ('THT') and Huskie deposits on the Waterbury Lake Property ('Waterbury'). The Midwest Main, Midwest A, THT and Huskie deposits are located within 20 kilometres of the McClean Lake mill.

post was written by Nicholas Jacobino\n\nIt's a big, noisy universe of stocks out there.Welcome to goodbye or goodbye.Our goal.To help cut through that noise to navigate the best moves for your portfolio.Today we're taking a look at the power behind clean energy stocks joining me here to discuss his defiance ETF, CEO and CIO.So thanks so much for being here.Thanks.Thanks for having me to see you.So let's get to your goodbye.First of all, the one that you like and that is uranium energy.So basically a bet on what's happening in nuclear power.We've seen the stock already go higher over the past year, But let's get to your case here, and it has to do with nuclear, as one might imagine.So what are you looking at here exactly?So as you have here, nuclear power is essentially the cleanest type of power and energy that we can use the cleanest type of electricity that we can use.And you know, the only abundant amount of clean energy that we can use.So you have for every dollar of fossil fuels being used, you have an investment of a dollar 70 in clean energy like nuclear.And so you know, any kind of uranium types of companies uranium, ETF, S are going to benefit from this as it grows.And also it's subject to sort of what's been happening in geopolitics, which has been interesting because the underlying uranium as a as a um, a source has been rising in prices because there's been shortages of it.Yeah, exactly.So there's a supply issue.There's, you know, high level high levels of demand for uranium levels of supply.So you had a couple of things in Kazakhstan.You had this issue where they had a lack of sulfuric acid so they couldn't produce as much.And then you also have the government, the US government banning any kind of uranium imports from Russia.And so that right away spiked the price of uranium for investors in that stock.And, you know, they saw the price pop.So last year was just a parabolic move for uranium, and this year is going to, you know, looking like it might be the same because of some of the supply demand stuff.Interesting.And speaking of demand, also, you were looking at some of the forecasts for what the global demand for uranium is going to be yes.So the global demand for uranium is set to double within the next 10 years, you know.So you're you're talking about a massive growth in this energy space.It's going to be a massive use of clean energy such high needs for this.And I think that, you know, more production is going to come out of the US, particularly as we have offshore betting.So another reason why the stock price might pop interesting.We always like to talk about the risks for any of this.And, you know, uranium is a little tricky here.It is volatile.There's been regulatory overhang in the past, and it only seems like recently that there's been sort of a sentiment turn when it comes to nuclear energy.Yeah, it's a tough thing, because on one hand we have this, you know, big priority as as as a nation and as a globe to to become carbon neutral by 2050.You know, everything is sort of about green energy, clean energy, uranium fits the bill, but then actually creating safe infrastructure that doesn't have any issues or and you know, government regulation because of issues and accidents that have happened in the past is one problem.And the the cost of investing in that infrastructure can some times be burdensome.So and then the supply and demand story can shift too, right?If you un ban imports and you have increased the fly, that might change the story.But for now, I think, um, uranium is is looking to be on that.And do you have a position in UEC?I don't at this time.OK, so let's get to the stock you don't like in the clean energy sector.And that is sun power, which is already down quite a bit over the last year.Now, solar stocks in general have been sort of weak, but this one stands out in particular.It's got some challenges.Um, let's talk about some of them.So there have been some misstatements over the past couple of years.Accounting wise.Yeah.So they've had some accounting errors, basically, and I think that they lost a lot of confidence from investors when the accounting errors were announced.Essentially, the stock price began to fall, and so they're going to have to invest a lot in terms of, you know, keeping up with record keeping efficiency, fixing the errors and coming up and proving that, you know, they they aren't in any kind of, um, credit risk default types of situation and investors can, you know, count on their their statements.Um, there is also the issue of rates, which is, you know, you don't automatically think of solar as being an interest rate sensor sector, but it has been it has been.And so the the growth of solar is starting to slow down.The there are two reasons.One, there's a supply backup.Right.So we talked about uranium.They're shorter supply.They're benefiting with solar.You kind of have this backup.And if you think about, like, what happened with semiconductors after covid, you actually had this, Um, at some point, you had a backlog of supply and it took about 18 months to shake out, and, you know, boy did it right.And so that's one of the issues with solar.But the reason that you kind of have the supply sitting there is because the cost of these projects is so high and the average person is impacted by inflation and doesn't want to borrow with a high, you know, level of rates.And then same thing for the company actually trying to, you know, service their own debt.So I think that there is a little bit of a hiccup there for them in the near term, because of rates and inflation, and and then also to go sort of go back to the, um, credibility question, if you will.You you think just generally there's some questions, I think, Yeah, the the the books and records that we talked about.Um, they had two negative earnings seasons.But I think, you know, the loss of confidence also kind of just came back into play because they're laying off 25% of their staff.80 people in Seattle is the last.I heard a couple of 100 people elsewhere.You know, that's not super reassuring.For for the future of the company, we love cost cutting.You know, you've heard a lot of these big tech companies cost cutting so that they can invest in a I you know, this just isn't that so.We have to see how this this shakes out.And then, just like we talked about the risk to the bull case.Let's talk about what could go right here.And that's just that you are still seeing sort of overall demand for solar power.And it goes back to what we talked about before with nuclear.You know, if we want to be carbon neutral by 2050 if we care about the climate, green energy, clean energy, things like this, you know, solar is still a leader there, and solar is also a volatile sector.You know, you kind of see these stocks and ETFs pop up and down, depending on, um, cyclicality of the markets and things like this.So there's there's hope we'll keep an eye on it.All right, let's sum up what you are telling investors here you would recommend buying uranium energy demand is expected to grow for uranium.Prices may also go up.That can mean rise in province for the company on the side, you say some power.It has been hitting a bumpy road with misstatements and also the rate hikes which continue to weigh on solar power companies.Thank you

As for the EU, its share in uranium supply was 17%, 22% in conversion and 30% in uranium enrichment services.\n\nRemoving such economic dependencies required time to reorient production chains, which is much harder when a global market has limited supply.\n\nFinally, US Senate passed the bill last week, extending the ban on Russian uranium imports until 2040.\n\nIt's not that simple though. The decision also includes certain more compromising provisions. In particular, the Department of Energy will have the authority to grant exemptions, provided that companies can demonstrate that they cannot obtain alternative supplies.\n\nHowever, the validity period of all such exemptions is set to expire by early 2028.\n\nWill such US restrictions trigger a domino effect, leading to a full-fledged sanction regime against Russian civilian nuclear energy?\n\nFirstly, the loss of European and American markets by Rosatom will not be challenging for the Russian nuclear giant. Sanctions against Rosatom primarily aim to eliminate Western countries' dependence on Russia and fulfil their moral duty not to finance armed aggression rather than inflict significant destabilising damage on the Russian energy sector.\n\nSuch likelihood exist within the EU. Uranium reserves in the EU are sufficient to meet the continent's average needs for the next three years.\n\nMoreover, the economic environment, created partly by the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, is not in favour of the Russians. The increase in uranium prices stimulates activity in new extraction projects. Additionally, there has been noticeable activity from Western companies in the global uranium conversion and enrichment market over the past two years.\n\nThus, the American decision on uranium embargo could open up opportunities, even for European sanctions.\n\nThe situation regarding full-fledged sanctions against Rosatom in Europe faces currently a dead end. Experts speak of the time needed to achieve technological capability for a painless cessation of cooperation with Rosatom.\n\nHowever, if immediate sanctions are met with arguments about technological obstacles, it's worth considering more flexible response options. More precisely, the first step towards successful imposition of sanctions could be the adoption of a medium-term strategy to reduce dependence on Russian civilian nuclear energy.", "source": {"uri": "eurointegration.com.ua", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u0404\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriched_uranium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enriched uranium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uranium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosatom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rosatom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domino effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://img.eurointegration.com.ua/images/doc/a/c/ac71c37-nuclear-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549369", "eventUri": "eng-9549369", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The first big factor is on the demand side, where torrid population growth is set to cool into 2025. If planned federal caps on nonpermanent residents materialize, Canada should see population growth slow from north of 3% to about 1% -- which will directly impact rental demand. The second big factor is on the supply side, where a record number of units are currently under construction. As these units reach completion, many of which are investor-owned, they should add to rental supply. The combination of these forces could quickly change market dynamics. For real estate investors: prices aren't rising, cash flow is already tight at current cap rates...so what happens if the narrative of endless population and rent growth changes? Unfortunately for inflation, changes in market rent move very deliberately into the CPI, so it would be a while before there is relief in official inflation measures.\"\n\n***\n\nTD Cowen analyst Greg Barnes details how a ban on Russian uranium imports caused a spike in the commodity price,\n\n\"Passage of legislation to ban the import of Russian nuclear fuel by the U.S. Senate by 2028 last week is likely to impact the global nuclear fuel market, not just the U.S. market ... Not surprisingly, the uranium spot uranium price rallied on the news. The UxC spot uranium price has climbed $5.85/lb over the past week (+6.6%) to $93.85/lb and has climbed >10% from the recent low of $85/lb in mid-March. The April month-end term price is $75.00/lb. The U.S. Senate passed H.R. 1042 (The Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act) during the evening of April 30, catching most industry participants by surprise ... Specifically, the law bans unirradiated low-enriched uranium (i.e., uranium that has not been in a reactor) that is produced in Russia or by a Russian entity from being imported into the United States. However, the Department of Energy (DOE) may waive this ban if the DOE determines that (1) no alternative viable source of low-enriched uranium is available to sustain the continued operation of a nuclear reactor or a U.S. nuclear energy company, or (2) importation of the uranium is in the national interest ... Cameco management noted on the recent quarterly conference call that it believes that one of the reasons that term contracting volumes have been slower so far this year has been uncertainty about the timing and impact of the potential ban on Russian imports. With that uncertainty now largely lifted, we believe that there could be an uptick in contracting\"\n\n***\n\nIn Wednesday's newsletter I discussed a recent report by CIBC managing director Ian de Verteuil arguing that conservative, low volatility stocks are unlikely to outperform for the foreseeable future,\n\n\"Low Vol has been the dominant quantitative investing strategy in Canada for years. The approach has worked on two levels. First, the de facto low volatility nature of the strategy appeals to conservative investors. Returns may not be as favourable as say Quality or Momentum investing, but as the argument goes, the ride is smoother ... Going forward, we think Low Vol is unlikely to outperform in the long term. While 10-year interest rates appear to have found a level after a significant move higher, Low Vol's limited exposure to commodity stocks will weigh on relative returns if the cycle for resources is extended. As well, traditional Low Vol favorites (Banks, Telecoms and Grocers) seem to face consistent political and regulatory headwinds.\n\nTo be clear, Low Vol approaches clearly still deliver on their \"brand.\" They continue to offer investors a moderation of market volatility and have in the past outperformed (often meaningfully) in periods of negative returns for the S&P/TSX\"\n\nDiversion: \"Dell responds to return-to-office resistance with VPN, badge tracking\" - Ars Technica", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uranium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Population growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply-side_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply-side economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Globe_and_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Globe and Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriched_uranium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enriched uranium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_analysis_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quantitative analysis (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum_investing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Momentum investing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameco", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_Technica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ars Technica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/7BPACHLGAJAGNPNVM7FPILCEKA.JPG?auth=7dff21418821bb633176932cca9d1b672dddcffff090e65584ce1aa7521ef56d&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549369", "eventUri": "eng-9549369", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 1997, "textEnd": 2005}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

('Denison' or the 'Company') (TSX: DML) (NYSE American: DNN) today filed its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion & Analysis ('MD&A') for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Both documents will be available on the Company's website at www.denisonmines.com, SEDAR+ (at www.sedarplus.ca) and EDGAR (at www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml). The highlights provided below are derived from these documents and should be read in conjunction with them. All amounts in this release are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated. View PDF\n\nDavid Cates, President and CEO of Denison commented, \"This year, Denison commemorates its 70th year of uranium mining, exploration, and development. Denison's long history in uranium mining has been characterized by strategic vision, technological advancement, and an entrepreneurial drive to accomplish things others thought impossible. Modern Denison's defining moment can be traced to a decision, from approximately 15-years ago, to reposition the Company away from a high-cost global expansion platform to focus on the exploration and development of high-grade uranium deposits in the Athabasca Basin region of northern Saskatchewan. This strategy built on Denison's discovery of the Phoenix deposit in 2008 and demonstrated a steadfast conviction that uranium and nuclear energy would be recognized as an essential source of baseload power generation in the long-run - offering an unrivaled combination of emission-free energy and energy security.\n\nOur tireless efforts to advance the Company's strategy, and complete technical evaluations of our flagship Wheeler River project, led to the bold selection of the In-Situ Recovery ('ISR') mining method for the Phoenix deposit in 2018, and have put us in a position where we are nearing a final investment decision to proceed with the construction of potentially one of the lowest-cost uranium mines in the world. In Q1'2024 we made several important steps towards this objective, including the transition from Front-End Engineering Design to detailed design, and the exclusive acquisition of MaxPERF tooling systems, which are expected to support our industry leading deployment of the low-cost ISR mining method in the Athabasca Basin.\n\nDenison's portfolio of uranium reserves, resources, and physical holdings has greatly appreciated in value through late 2023 and into early 2024, as positive sentiment in the uranium and nuclear energy markets has sustained and uranium prices have rapidly increased. As Denison has avoided entering low-priced uranium supply contracts in recent years and has held its physical uranium investment to support future project financing efforts for Phoenix, we are now in an enviable spot with significant uncommitted uranium production and physical holdings potentially available to the market at time of expected scarcity. Taken together with continued geopolitical instability and the expected emergence of significant additional demand from new nuclear builds, it is an ideal time for our Company to be readying to build a low-cost Saskatchewan-based uranium mine.\n\nAs we celebrate Denison's legacy of uranium mining in 2024, we look forward to marking this year with several additional notable milestones from our exciting portfolio of Saskatchewan-based uranium mining, exploration, and development projects.\"\n\nHighlightsTransition to Detailed Design Engineering for Flagship Phoenix ISR Project with Award of $16 Million Contract to Wood\n\nIn January 2024, Denison awarded a contract for approximately $16 million to Wood Canada Limited ('Wood'), for the completion of detailed design engineering for the In-Situ Recovery ('ISR') mining project planned for the Phoenix uranium deposit ('Phoenix').\n\nWood completed a Feasibility Study ('Phoenix FS') in 2023 to evaluate the use of the ISR mining method at Phoenix, the results of which reflected several years of technical de-risking efforts successfully completed by Denison and demonstrated robust economics. Following completion of the Phoenix FS, Denison's Board of Directors approved the continuation of efforts to advance Phoenix towards a final investment decision ('FID') and, in late 2023, the Management Committee of the Wheeler River Joint Venture approved a budget for the applicable 2024 expenditures, including detailed engineering design.\n\nThe scope of the facilities to be designed by Wood under the contract is extensive, with work commencing in the first quarter of 2024 and potentially extending into the first half of 2025.\n\nAnnouncement of Planned Restart of McClean Lake Mining Operations\n\nIn January 2024, Orano Canada Inc. ('Orano Canada') and Denison announced the planned restart of uranium mining operations on the McClean Lake property. Mining is expected to be carried out using the joint venture's patented Surface Access Borehole Resource Extraction ('SABRE') mining method and is planned to commence at the McClean North deposit in 2025. Activities in 2024 are intended to be focused on completing the preparations necessary to ready the existing SABRE mining site and equipment for continuous commercial operations, as well as the installation of eight pilot holes for the first mining cavities planned for excavation. The approved budget for this work in 2024 is $7.0 million (100% basis). Approximately 800,000 lbs U3O8 (100% basis) are targeted for production from McClean North in 2025, with approximately 3,000,000 lbs U3O8 (100% basis) identified for potential additional production from a combination of the McClean North and Caribou deposits during the years 2026 to 2030.\n\nSigning of Sustainable Communities Investment Agreement\n\nIn March 2024, Denison signed a Sustainable Communities Investment Agreement with the municipalities of the Northern Village of Beauval, the Northern Village of \u00cele-\u00e0-la Crosse, the Northern Hamlet of Jans Bay, and the Northern Hamlet of Cole Bay (the 'Communities').\n\nThe agreement with the Communities establishes commitments of Denison in support of community development initiatives, with consideration towards contributing to the current and future economic prosperity and sustainability of the Communities by promoting economic development and investments in capital projects, job creation and training, housing, education, and other initiatives.\n\nAs part of the agreement, the Communities have provided their consent and support for the Wheeler River project and have committed, amongst other things, to support all regulatory approvals issued for the project related to exploration, evaluation, development, operation, reclamation, and closure activities.\n\nAcquisition of MaxPERF Tool Systems\n\nIn February 2024, the Company announced an acquisition of fixed and mobile MaxPERF Tool Systems from Penetrators Canada Inc. ('Penetrators'). The MaxPERF Tool Systems have been successfully deployed several times as a method of permeability enhancement in ISR field studies conducted on the Company's potential ISR mining projects, including at Phoenix. Penetrators has also agreed to work exclusively with Denison for a 10-year period with respect to the use of the MaxPERF Tool Systems for uranium mining applications, and related services, in Saskatchewan.\n\nSale of Uranium\n\nIn April 2024, Denison completed the sale of 100,000 pounds of U3O8 from its physical uranium holdings, at a price of US$100.00 per pound. The sale was agreed in January 2024, and is part of the Company's plans (see Outlook 2024) to sell approximately 300,000 pounds U3O8 from its physical uranium holdings during 2024. Denison acquired its physical uranium position in 2021 at an average cost of US$29.65 per pound U3O8.\n\nEarn-In Agreement with Grounded Lithium Corp.\n\nIn January 2024, Denison entered into an agreement with Grounded Lithium Corp. ('Grounded Lithium') to acquire up to a 75% interest in the Kindersley Lithium Project ('KLP') in Saskatchewan. The agreement includes a series of earn-in options, with each earn-in option requiring a cash payment to Grounded Lithium as well as work expenditures to advance the KLP. Should Denison complete all three earn-in options, it will have made cumulative cash payments to Grounded Lithium of $3.2 million and have funded $12.0 million in project expenditures to earn a 75% interest in the KLP. The Company is currently evaluating its 2024 plans and will update its outlook for the year once the plan has been finalized.About Denison\n\nDenison Mines Corp. was formed under the laws of Ontario and is a reporting issuer in all Canadian provinces and territories. Denison's common shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the 'TSX') under the symbol 'DML' and on the NYSE American exchange under the symbol 'DNN'.\n\nDenison is a uranium mining, exploration and development company with interests focused in the Athabasca Basin region of northern Saskatchewan, Canada. The Company has an effective 95% interest in its flagship Wheeler River Uranium Project, which is the largest undeveloped uranium project in the infrastructure rich eastern portion of the Athabasca Basin region of northern Saskatchewan. In mid-2023, the Phoenix FS was completed for the Phoenix deposit as an ISR mining operation, and an update to the previously prepared 2018 Pre-Feasibility Study ('PFS') was completed for Wheeler River's Gryphon deposit as a conventional underground mining operation. Based on the respective studies, both deposits have the potential to be competitive with the lowest cost uranium mining operations in the world. Permitting efforts for the planned Phoenix ISR operation commenced in 2019 and have advanced significantly, with licensing in progress and a draft Environmental Impact Study ('EIS') submitted for regulatory and public review in October 2022.\n\nDenison's interests in Saskatchewan also include a 22.5% ownership interest in the McClean Lake Joint Venture ('MLJV'), which includes unmined uranium deposits (planned for extraction via the MLJV's SABRE mining method starting in 2025) and the McClean Lake uranium mill (currently utilizing a portion of its licensed capacity to process the ore from the Cigar Lake mine under a toll milling agreement), plus a 25.17% interest in the Midwest Joint Venture ('MWJV')'s Midwest Main and Midwest A deposits, and a 69.35% interest in the Tthe Heldeth T\u00fa\u00e9 ('THT') and Huskie deposits on the Waterbury Lake Property ('Waterbury'). The Midwest Main, Midwest A, THT and Huskie deposits are located within 20 kilometres of the McClean Lake mill. Taken together, the Company has direct ownership interests in properties covering ~384,000 hectares in the Athabasca Basin region.\n\nAdditionally, through its 50% ownership of JCU (Canada) Exploration Company, Limited ('JCU'), Denison holds additional interests in various uranium project joint ventures in Canada, including the Millennium project (JCU, 30.099%), the Kiggavik project (JCU, 33.8118%) and Christie Lake (JCU, 34.4508%).\n\nIn 2024, Denison is celebrating its 70th year in uranium mining, exploration, and development, which began in 1954 with Denison's first acquisition of mining claims in the Elliot Lake region of northern Ontario.\n\nTechnical Disclosure and Qualified Person\n\nThe technical information contained in this press release has been reviewed and approved by Chad Sorba, P.Geo., Denison's Vice President Technical Services & Project Evaluation, and Andy Yackulic, P.Geo., Denison's Vice President Exploration, who are both Qualified Persons in accordance with the requirements of NI 43-101.\n\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nCertain information contained in this press release constitutes 'forward-looking information', within the meaning of the applicable United States and Canadian legislation concerning the business, operations and financial performance and condition of Denison.

As Director, Board Chair, and the Company's previous CEO, Ron made countless invaluable contributions to the strategic direction of the Company and development of several members of the management team.

Denison's common shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the 'TSX') under the symbol 'DML' and on the NYSE American exchange under the symbol 'DNN'.\n\nDenison is a uranium mining, exploration and development company with interests focused in the Athabasca Basin region of northern Saskatchewan, Canada. The Company has an effective 95% interest in its flagship Wheeler River Uranium Project, which is the largest undeveloped uranium project in the infrastructure rich eastern portion of the Athabasca Basin region of northern Saskatchewan. In mid-2023, the Phoenix Feasibility Study was completed for the Phoenix deposit as an ISR mining operation, and an update to the previously prepared 2018 Pre-Feasibility Study was completed for Wheeler River's Gryphon deposit as a conventional underground mining operation. Based on the respective studies, both deposits have the potential to be competitive with the lowest cost uranium mining operations in the world. Permitting efforts for the planned Phoenix ISR operation commenced in 2019 and have advanced significantly, with licensing in progress and a draft Environmental Impact Study submitted for regulatory and public review in October 2022.\n\nDenison's interests in Saskatchewan also include a 22.5% ownership interest in the McClean Lake Joint Venture ('MLJV'), which includes unmined uranium deposits (planned for extraction via the MLJV's SABRE mining method starting in 2025) and the McClean Lake uranium mill (currently utilizing a portion of its licensed capacity to process the ore from the Cigar Lake mine under a toll milling agreement), plus a 25.17% interest in the Midwest Joint Venture's Midwest Main and Midwest A deposits, and a 69.35% interest in the Tthe Heldeth T\u00fa\u00e9 ('THT') and Huskie deposits on the Waterbury Lake Property. The Midwest Main, Midwest A, THT and Huskie deposits are located within 20 kilometres of the McClean Lake mill. Taken together, the Company has direct ownership interests in properties covering ~384,000 hectares in the Athabasca Basin region.\n\nAdditionally, through its 50% ownership of JCU (Canada) Exploration Company, Limited ('JCU'), Denison holds additional interests in various uranium project joint ventures in Canada, including the Millennium project (JCU, 30.099%), the Kiggavik project (JCU, 33.8118%) and Christie Lake (JCU, 34.4508%).\n\nIn 2024, Denison is celebrating its 70th year in uranium mining, exploration, and development, which began in 1954 with Denison's first acquisition of mining claims in the Elliot Lake region of northern Ontario.\n\nFollow Denison on X (formerly Twitter) @DenisonMinesCo\n\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nCertain information contained in this news release constitutes 'forward-looking information', within the meaning of the applicable United States and Canadian legislation concerning the business, operations and financial performance and condition of Denison.

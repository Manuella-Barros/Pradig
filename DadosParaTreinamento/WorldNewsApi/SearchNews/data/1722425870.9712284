{"id": 243233866, "title": "Lakers Trolled by NBA Fans After Dejounte Murray's Trade to Pelicans amid LA Rumors", "text": "Dejounte Murray is reportedly heading to the New Orleans Pelicans after a rumored trade with the Atlanta Hawks, per ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. In return for Murray, the Hawks got Larry Nance Jr., Dyson Daniels, a 2025 first-round pick and a 2027 first-round pick. The Hawks trading Murray was a somewhat expected move, but many anticipated Atlanta to deal him to the Los Angeles Lakers. After the trade with the Pelicans, NBA fans trolled the Lakers for failing to secure Murray. In addition to trolling the Lakers, NBA fans also reacted to Young and Murray's record in Atlanta together. The duo went 55-62 and was largely disappointing. The trade is certainly disappointing for Lakers fans, who were hoping to get a major addition in Murray, but there's still plenty of time for Los Angeles to make some moves before the end of the offseason. One of those moves could be adding Hawks' star Trae Young, as the Lakers are reportedly \"appealing\" to the point guard if Atlanta decides to move on from him. After trading Murray, though, it's not clear whether the Hawks are willing to part with both of their stars in the same offseason. It's also unclear whether the Lakers will try to make any big moves this offseason following the NBA draft. Los Angeles picked up former Tennessee star Dalton Knecht, who could give the team enough of an offensive boost without having to make a trade. But the Lakers are in win-now mode with LeBron James entering his 21st season, so Los Angeles might not have another choice but to make a splash this offseason.", "summary": "Dejounte Murray is reportedly heading to the New Orleans Pelicans after a rumored trade with the Atlanta Hawks, per ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.

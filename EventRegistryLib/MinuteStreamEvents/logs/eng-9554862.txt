The resignation was officially accepted by Governor Kalraj Mishra, as confirmed by a Raj Bhavan spokesperson. This move comes amidst a broader shake-up in the state's medical education and healthcare administration.\n\nDr. Bhandari tendered his resignation to Governor Mishra during a meeting at Raj Bhavan, with the resignation taking effect immediately. Following this, Dr. Dhananjay Agarwal, a senior professor in the department of Nephrology at Sawai Mansingh Medical College, Jaipur, has been appointed to fill the vacated position.\n\nThe backdrop to these changes involves a recent scandal that has shaken the medical community in Rajasthan. Earlier this week, the Rajasthan government took decisive action by relieving Dr. Rajiv Bagarhatta and Dr. Achal Sharma from their respective roles as Principal of Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Medical College and Superintendent of SMS Hospital. Their removal was directly linked to an investigation into a fraudulent No Objection Certificate (NOC) case concerning organ transplants.\n\nFurthermore, Dr. Bhandari was also removed from his position as Chairman of the Steering Committee for State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (SOTO), highlighting the gravity of the situation. The scandal came to light following the arrest of three individuals by the Anti-Corruption Bureau on April 1, accused of accepting bribes in exchange for issuing fake NOCs for organ transplants.\n\nThis incident has not only led to punitive actions against key figures within Jaipur's medical institutions but has also prompted an extensive investigation into the practices of several hospitals in the city. Medical Minister Gajendra Singh Khinvsar has ordered this investigation to ensure such unethical practices are eradicated from the state's healthcare system.\n\nThe swift actions taken by the Rajasthan government and healthcare authorities reflect their commitment to maintaining integrity and trust within the medical community. As this situation unfolds, further details are expected to emerge regarding measures to prevent such incidents in the future and ensure that those in need of medical care can trust in the processes designed to protect their health and well-being.", "source": {"uri": "oneindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oneindia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "krishna_kripa@oneindia.com", "name": "Krishna Kripa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RUHS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "RUHS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raj_Bhavan,_Chennai", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Raj Bhavan, Chennai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalraj_Mishra", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kalraj Mishra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_University_of_Health_Sciences", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan University of Health Sciences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Objection_Certificate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "No Objection Certificate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Organ transplantation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_Singh_II", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Man Singh II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Rajasthan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Rajasthan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjuna", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arjuna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nephrology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaipur", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaipur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jaipur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khinvsar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khinvsar"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare", "label": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Medical_Relief", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Medical Relief", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Services", "wgt": 19}], "image": "https://www.oneindia.com/img/2024/05/rajasthan-ruhs-vc-sudhir-bhandari-resignation-ft.jpg?10052024005455", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554862", "eventUri": "eng-9554862", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-01", "textStart": 1566, "textEnd": 1573}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

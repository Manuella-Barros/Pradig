I got fired from Frasier,\" Kudrow told Sean Hayes on the SmartLess podcast, also co-hosted by Jason Bateman and Will Arnett.\n\nKudrow said getting fired from Frasier was \"devastating\" and that director James Burrows said, \"This isn't working,\" during the pilot's run-through.\n\n\"I was trying to like [ask], 'What can I do?' But I think they did make a casting mistake because I went to the network with Perry Gilpin,\" Kudrow said. \"I think they were just correcting a mistake. Cause Perry should have always been Roz.\"\n\nAlthough getting fired from Frasier was a setback for Kudrow, she soon booked a guest-starring role on Mad About You, which \"changed a lot\" for her.\n\n\"I did a guest star on Mad About You, they had me back, I'd already done a guest star the first season,\" she said. \"So now I'm there for a different character and my agent said, 'You're not doing this.'\"\n\nKudrow said the character was only called \"Waitress,\" and she had no name. Despite her agents advising against booking the role, Kudrow told them she was \"not in a position to say no. It's to me the best show and I'm doing it.\"\n\nThe comedic actress said that by the end of the week, Mad About You creator and writer said, \"You're so funny. Would you be OK doing five more episodes?\"\n\n\"I just went, 'Yes!' There's my rent for the year. I don't have to get another job,\" Kudrow added.\n\nWhile reading for Friends, Kudrow encountered Burrows once again after getting fired from Frasier. Kudrow said that in a special celebrating Burrows's career, she learned that \"I was the only cast member for Friends that had to audition for Jimmy Burrows.\"\n\nAfter the SmartLess co-hosts asked why, Kudrow replied, \"Because I had just gotten fired from Frasier.\"\n\nArnett noted that Burrows \"could've been instrumental in your firing from Frasier,\" Kudrow replied, \"I don't know. Probably.\"\n\n\"When I had my audition, I did it... it was just this small room,\" Kudrow recalled. \"[Burrows] is sitting at a desk. I'm in a chair, and the audition was like a little monologue. And when I'm done, he just went, 'No notes.' And I thought, 'Alright. I don't know what that means. It's hopeless.'\"\n\nKudrow went on to book the role on Friends and played the role throughout its 10-season run.

When [it was] done, he just went 'No notes,' and I thought 'all right, I don't know what means. It's hopeless or it's perfect?\"\n\nKudrow had initially been cast as Roz Doyle in Frasier, who produces the lead character's radio show. However, she was fired only three days into filming.\n\nDuring a 2021 interview with People, Kudrow said the decision was mostly down to Burrows, telling the outlet \"I wasn't right for the part.\"\n\n\"I wasn't right for the part [or] for the chemistry of the group,\" she said.\n\nThe Comeback star also explained how she landed the role of Phoebe during Smartless.\n\nFriends co-creator David Crane was dating Jeffrey Klarik, writer of Mad About You. Kudrow played snippy waitress Ursula on the 1990s sitcom, a character that would later make several cameo appearances on Friends as Phoebe's twin sister.\n\n\"Jeffrey said 'What about Lisa, that might be a good Phoebe,'\" she said.\n\nThe role of Phoebe would go on to change Kudrow's life. The Friends cast became megastars, with Kudrow nominated for six Emmy awards during the show's run, and winning Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 1998.\n\nThe season 10 finale drew 52.5 million viewers when it aired in 2004. The sitcom is still one of the most watched TV shows of all time.

I got fired from 'Frasier,'\" Kudrow said on the \"SmartLess\" podcast hosted by Jason Bateman, Will Arnett, and Sean Hayes. \"I was trying to like [ask], 'What can I do?' But I think they did make a casting mistake because I went to the network with Perri Gilpin. I think they were just correcting a mistake, because Peri should have always been Roz.\"\n\nKudrow had appeared on \"Cheers\" and later went on to guest star on \"Mad About You,\" where series writer/producer Jeffrey Klarik suggested she audition for the Phoebe role in his partner David Crane's series \"Friends.\"\n\nSo she did -- and she actually had to audition for Burrows, the very guy who canned her from \"Frasier.\"\n\n\"I was the only cast member for 'Friends' that had to audition for Jimmy Burrows,\" she said, \"because I had just gotten fired from 'Frasier.'\"\n\nKudrow recalled being in a \"small room\" across from Burrows while she performed a monologue.\n\n\"When I'm done, he just went, 'No notes.' And I thought, 'Alright. I don't know what that means. It's hopeless,'\" she said.\n\nOf course, Kudrow got the part and the rest is TV history. She won an Emmy in 1998 for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.\n\nAs for \"Frasier,\" it returned in 2023 and has been renewed for a second season.\n\nThese days, Kudrow is looking to be rebooting another one of her past roles: \"The Comeback\" HBO series.\n\n\"I'm just thrilled and adore anyone who has the level of appreciation for 'The Comeback' that meets the level of pride I have for doing that show,\" Kudrow recently told Newsweek of the clamoring for more of the meta comedy series. \"That is thrilling. I'm happy to hear that.\"\n\nKudrow added of a possible third season, \"Oh God, I'd love to. [Showrunner] Michael Patrick King and I are always talking about what would happen next. Always. And it's been nine, 10 years now. So we're due.\"", "source": {"uri": "indiewire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IndieWire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samantha_bergeson@indiewire.com", "name": "Samantha Bergeson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SEI_213264073-9211.webp?w=644", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778387", "eventUri": "eng-9778387", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 460134369, "relevance": 2}

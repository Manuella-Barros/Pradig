Click here for full details of latest MPNP draws.\n\nWhen will the new policy for work permit extensions be launched?\n\nAccording to the official letter that Minister Miller sent to the Immigration Minister of Manitoba, officials will soon share a letter of intent outlining the specifics of the public policy as well as additional conditions and qualifying criteria.\n\nTo support this facilitative step, the letter will include conditions, such as a schedule for performance reporting.\n\nThe minister also said, \"I believe this will be an opportune time and context to also revisit the renewal of the Canada-Manitoba Immigration Agreement, as well as to advance discussions on how Manitoba will use its PNP to transition more temporary residents to permanent residency.\"\n\nWith the implementation of this one-time facilitation measure, Canada aims to directly and positively affect prospective nominees by allowing them to work in Manitoba while their PNP applications are processed.\n\nLong-term, as these temporary residents move to permanent status, this policy will add to Manitoba's varied skilled labour supply.\n\nProvincial Effort For Expiring Work Permits\n\nApart from securing temporary policy from the Immigration Minister, the Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program (MPNP) has recently stepped up to help temporary residents with expired or expiring work permits.\n\nEffective April 26, Manitoba is also giving assessments of MPNP applications filed by holders of post-graduation work permits (PGWPs) and other work permits that are about to expire priority.\n\nTo ensure priority processing, MPNP applicants whose work authorizations have expired or will expire within the next 45 days must notify the MPNP by filling out the Skilled Worker Webform.\n\nWhat about other provinces?\n\nThis effort, addressing larger concerns about the need for a coherent immigration plan across Canada, will support thousands of important temporary workers in Manitoba while they await their applications for permanent residence.\n\nDiscussions of the difficulties encountered by international students on post-graduation work permits with expired or about-to-expire work permits have sparked requests for similar actions in other provinces.\n\nThe question that still remains as the country observes this trend is if other provinces would follow suit in offering temporary residents working inside their borders routes to open work permits.\n\nThe Immigration Minister is also holding a yearly meeting with all the provincial and territorial immigration ministers on May 10.\n\nSo let's hope we see some positive development in such a scenario for other provinces as well.", "source": {"uri": "immigrationnewscanada.ca", "dataType": "news",

The extension was to give Manitoba time to work through a backlog of provincial nominee program applications.\n\n\"This is really great news for our province. This is really great news for about 6,700 workers, their families and for employers across the province who have been put into this desperate situation,\" Marcelino told reporters.\n\nIn demonstrations at the legislature in recent months, international students and graduates called attention to their plight as the deadline loomed.\n\nThey said they decided to study in Manitoba because it promised a pathway to permanent resident status through the nominee program, but said they were excluded from any of its draws in recent months.\n\nMarcelino blamed delays on a \"huge backlog\" of applications due, in part, to cuts made by the previous Tory administration, along with last year's announcement by the federal government that it would no longer grant 18-month work permit extensions to foreign nationals.\n\nAlthough she had asked Miller for a three-year work permit extension, she said it was her \"pleasure\" to let those who are waiting and worrying, know that they have another two years to work while their applications are processed.\n\n\"It's really, really important to our business community. Our province requires it because we don't have enough natural population growth.\"\n\n\"We're here to champion them and welcome them in the province and work on our immigration system and our processes so that we can include them over the next two years as part of the draws,\" Marcelino said.\n\n\"Immigration is really important to our communities across the province,\" said the daughter of immigrants from the Philippines.\n\n\"It's really, really important to our business community. Our province requires it because we don't have enough natural population growth,\" she said. \"This is, in lots of ways, our bread and butter,\" she said.\n\nMiller acknowledged the difficulty of Manitoba losing 6,700 workers, in his letter to Marcelino.\n\n\"This situation is creating a challenge for Manitoba's labour needs,\" Miller wrote. He wrote that details of the policy, including \"additional eligibility requirements as well as other conditions,\" will be spelled out in a letter of intent in the near future.\n\nSome international graduates said they are anxiously waiting to find out details about the eligibility requirements and conditions.\n\n\"We in the Chinese community are hotly debating what the details of this policy will be,\" said the member of the Manitoba International Students Union, who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThey worry they may still be excluded from the nominee program draw.\n\nMarcelino offered reassurances to them Tuesday.\n\n\"We have many of these folks here already and it makes perfect sense to have them included as part of our nominations that we draw.\"\n\nProgressive Conservative immigration critic Jodie Byram said the two-year work permit extension is the result of political pressure applied by international students and skilled workers who had the courage to demonstrate at the legislature.\n\nWhile the federal minister's announcement buys more time for international grads to stay and become nominees, it won't increase the number of provincial nominee slots allocated for Manitoba.\n\nWinnipeg Liberal MP Kevin Lamoureux said Manitoba has an obligation to those who came to study and work here who understood they'd have a better shot at permanent resident status through the provincial nominee program.\n\nThe nominee program offers multiple pathways to immigration. The skilled worker stream is for internationally trained and experienced workers who have the skills needed in the local labour market. The international education stream offers a nomination fast-track to students who graduate in Manitoba and meet industry needs.\n\nThe program uses a point system, which is based on criteria that includes job and language skills, education, and family ties to the province, to determine who is eligible to apply for permanent resident status.

| CBC News", "body": "More than 6,700 newcomers in Manitoba whose federal work permits were set to expire this year will be able to stay in the province for at least another two years, Manitoba's labour and immigration minister said Tuesday.\n\nMalaya Marcelino says she got a letter from federal Immigration Minister Marc Miller Tuesday, confirming the federal government has approved the province's request to extend the expiring post-graduate work permits.\n\n\"This is really great news for our province,\" Marcelino told reporters at the Manitoba Legislature.\n\n\"This is really great news for about 6,700 ... workers, their families and for employers across the province, who have been put into this desperate situation.\"\n\nOttawa had announced in December it was no longer offering 18-month extensions to post-graduate work permits, after previously offering those extensions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFor months, temporary foreign workers have protested the change, along with another policy change in the Manitoba provincial nominee program's selection process that prioritizes newcomers who have family connections in the province.\n\nThousands of newcomers with expiring permits have applied to the nominee program -- which accepts a limited number of applicants each year -- and faced months-long waits.\n\nIn a letter posted to social media Tuesday, Miller said he was prepared to offer open work permits to newcomers whose permits are expiring in 2024, if they are employed in Manitoba and are eligible under Manitoba's nominee program.\n\n\"Within two years, it is expected that eligible foreign nationals will receive an official nomination from Manitoba and eventually become permanent residents through the [provincial nominee program],\" Miller wrote in the letter.\n\nMarcelino expects the federal government's extension will allow Manitoba's nominee program to accept nearly all of its applicants.\n\n\"Manitoba needs immigration,\" Marcelino said.\n\n\"We have many of these folks here already, and it makes perfect sense to have them included as part of our nominations that we draw, so this is ... really good news for Manitoba.\"",

Ensuring all workers are properly trained and paid is part of the goal, Naylor said.\n\nSome foreign workers are treated like \"private contractors\" -- they can't access the same benefits, they're underpaid and working \"far too long\" hours, Naylor added.\n\n\"This is a Canada problem,\" she said. \"We are needing to have communication across all provinces.\"\n\nThe working group, involving various levels of Manitoba's government, is to hold its second meeting soon.\n\nForeign worker program enforcement can be iffy, according to immigration lawyer Kenneth Zaifman. He's worked with temporary foreign workers, and businesses hiring such employees, for at least 25 years.\n\nGovernment \"may or may not\" monitor a company's actions once it's been deemed ineligible to hire temporary foreign workers for a time, Zaifman stated. \"One company is ineligible, they incorporate another company and do it again.\"\n\nSo-called chameleon carriers -- transport organizations who close and start a new company instead of addressing issues at the original enterprise -- correlate with some immigration and labour abuses, Dolyniuk echoed.\n\nTrucking companies use temporary foreign workers to fill staffing shortages; the need is immense, Dolyniuk noted: the sector must train and retain 3,485 drivers within five years.\n\nMany businesses don't use temporary foreign workers -- it is \"a challenging thing for companies to manage\" -- and not all who do mistreat their migrant staff, Dolyniuk added.\n\nGood companies follow federal program requirements and provide settlement and training support, he said.\n\nSome of the non-compliance fines businesses face are administrative, such as not properly sharing documents.\n\nThree of the nine Manitoba companies fined since January 2023 were targeted solely for documentation, according to a federal government webpage.\n\nTornado Haulers Ltd. is the newest Manitoba business on the list of non-compliants. It received a $78,000 bill in March; it hasn't paid and is currently ineligible to hire temporary foreign workers, according to the federal data.\n\nThe feds say Tornado Haulers broke Canadian law for hiring and recruiting employees and the company's pay or working conditions didn't match the offer of employment outline.\n\nTornado Haulers plans to take the government to court, a staff member told the Free Press by phone. The charges are \"totally unfair,\" he added.\n\nAround three of the 13 Manitoba companies fined and suspended for non-compliance in 2021-22 were trucking businesses. A pet spa and farming and construction ventures were among the others reprimanded.\n\nAnecdotally, Zaifman Law has noted more businesses recruiting temporary foreign workers amid the past years' labour shortages.\n\n\"Some employers feel the workers will not take any steps to jeopardize their future in Canada and they prey on those workers,\" Zaifman said, adding clients he assists stringently follow federal programs.\n\nTemporary foreign workers are not bound to the employer they've come to Canada for, despite what they might think, Zaifman explained.\n\nThose experiencing mistreatment can file a federal vulnerable worker application and ask for an open work permit, meaning they can apply for jobs elsewhere; their current employer doesn't have to know.\n\nSeveral government entities, including Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada and Manitoba's employment standards division, can investigate employers.\n\nEven so, the Temporary Foreign Worker program has major flaws, said Diwa Marcelino, an organizer with Migrante Manitoba, a grassroots advocate for migrants. \"The system produces exploitation.\"\n\nMany foreigners don't dare to speak up; they worry doing so will affect their permanent residency applications, he said.\n\nScrapping employer-tied work permits for \"open\" work permits will end the \"precarious situation where the employer has all the power,\" Marcelino said.\n\nOn Monday, Migrante held a news conference in Winnipeg, where four Filipinos who'd entered Canada on Temporary Foreign Worker permits alleged abuse at a Thompson hotel.\n\nAt the time, Manitoba Labour and Immigration Minister Malaya Marcelino said the province planned to hire more employment standards staff.", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com",

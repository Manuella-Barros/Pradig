Webb Simpson, who originally offered to give up his seat for McIlroy, will remain on the board. McIlroy's potential return was seen as a way to improve negotiations with LIV Golf but was met with complications. McIlroy was previously on the board but resigned due to time constraints and the PGA Tour's negotiations with Saudi backers. Despite not rejoining the board, McIlroy remains involved and has advocated for a more global schedule and collaboration between tours.\n\nRory McIlroy won't be returning to the PGA Tour board, saying Wednesday a plan to replace Webb Simpson was met with resistance from board members.\n\nSimpson, one of six player-directors, recently offered to give up his seat -- but only if McIlroy were to replace him. McIlroy would have needed board approval to be reinstated to a position that he resigned from last November.\n\nBut McIlroy said ahead of the Wells Fargo Championship that conversations surrounding his potential return became \"pretty complicated and messy,\" which reminded him of why he left in the first place.\n\n\"I think with the way it happened it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before,\" McIlroy said. \"I think there was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason.\" McIlroy's reinstatement would have been viewed as a chance to help improve the PGA Tour's stalled negotiations with the Saudi financial backers of LIV Golf.\n\nPGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan said the development \"is in no way a commentary on Rory's important perspective and influence.\" He said it was a matter of adhering to the governance process of joining the board.\n\n\"Webb remaining in his position as a member of the policy board and PGA Tour Enterprises board through the end of his term provides the continuity needed at this vital time,'' Monahan said.\n\nThe world's No. 2 player said when he stepped down he could no longer commit the time and energy that board work required with the PGA Tour trying to finalize an agreement with the Public Investment Fund.\n\nUnable to finalize a deal by the end of last year, the PGA Tour brought in Strategic Sports Group as a minority investor. That deal could be worth as much as $3 billion.\n\n\"I put my hand up to help and it was, I wouldn't say it was rejected, (but) it was a complicated process to get through to put me back on there,\" McIlroy said about potentially returning the board. \"So that's all fine, no hard feelings and we'll all move on.\" Simpson said he now plans to finish out his three-year term on the board. He said he offered to give up his seat to McIlroy because he's a \"global superstar\" and would give Europeans a needed voice in major tour decisions.\n\nMcIlroy is still likely to be involved, though not in a board capacity, given the relationships he has built on both tours. He also met with Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the governor of PIF, last year during the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai at the end of 2022. McIlroy said on a soccer podcast in January he encouraged the PGA Tour to meet with Al-Rumayyan.\n\nThe stunning framework agreement among the PGA Tour, European tour and PIF was announced June 6.\n\n\"Rory always had great ideas of how do we move forward, how do we get the love and attention from fans back from where we had it maybe two years ago, how do we grow our business, all things related to the PGA Tour,\" Simpson said.\n\nBut there are some on the board who remain at odds with the four-time major champion after McIlroy changed his views about LIV Golf in recent months, suggesting that LIV players be allowed to return to the PGA Tour without penalty.\n\nMcIlroy also disagreed in February with Jordan Spieth's comments that a deal with PIF was not needed because of the SSG investment, although it would help with unification.\n\nMcIlroy suggested one solution for growing the game would be going to a more global schedule that includes more tournaments overseas, although he questioned whether American players would want to travel out of the United States for a dozen events.\n\nRegardless, McIlroy remains bothered by the state of the game and wants to see a resolution for the good of the fans, a growing faction of which have become unhappy -- or even worse, apathetic -- with the splintering of players on two watered-down tours.\n\nMcIlroy said it's all about finding a compromise for both sides, even though neither side may walk away completely happy.\n\n\"I would say I'm impatient because I think we've got this window of opportunity to get it done, because both sides from a business perspective ... I wouldn't say need to get it done, but it makes sense,'' McIlroy said. ''And I just think -- I sort of liken it to like when Northern Ireland went through the peace process in the '90s and the Good Friday Agreement, neither side was happy.

So yeah, I think it got pretty complicated and pretty messy.\n\n\"I think with the way it happened, I think it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before. I think there was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason.\"\n\nSimpson, 38, will finish out his term, which expires in 2025. Simpson had hoped to step down from the boards to spend time with his family.\n\n\"I think the best course of action is if, you know, there's some people on there that aren't comfortable with me coming back on, then I think Webb just stays on and sees out his term,\" McIlroy said. \"I think he's gotten to a place where he's comfortable with doing that, and I just sort of keep doing what I'm doing.\"\n\nAlong with Simpson, the other player directors on the tour's policy board are Patrick Cantlay, Peter Malnati, Adam Scott, Jordan Spieth and Tiger Woods. Former tour member Joe Ogilvie is a board liaison.\n\nMcIlroy, the No. 2 golfer in the world, had joined the policy board in 2022 and was expected to serve through 2024. The 35-year-old cited personal and professional commitments in making his decision to leave the board late last year.\n\nMcIlroy's surprising reversal comes at a time when the PGA Tour is attempting to negotiate a final agreement with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, which finances the rival LIV Golf League. PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan and policy board player directors met with PIF governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan in the Bahamas on March 18.\n\nMcIlroy has previously met with Al-Rumayyan to discuss the future of men's professional golf. McIlroy said Al-Rumayyan wanted to do the \"right thing\" with PIF's investment in golf.\n\nHe said some PGA Tour members have voiced concerns about potentially playing a global schedule outside the U.S. and whether to allow golfers who left for LIV Golf to come back to the tour.\n\nWith Simpson staying on the policy board, McIlroy said he is \"still optimistic\" that a deal with the PIF can get done.\n\n\"I think Webb staying on is a really good thing,\" McIlroy said. \"I think he's got a really balanced voice in all of this, and I think he sees the bigger picture, which is great. My fear was if Webb stepped off and it wasn't me that was going in his place, what could potentially happen? Yeah, I'm really happy that Webb has made that decision to stay on and serve out the rest of his term.\"\n\nMcIlroy, who grew up in Northern Ireland, said both sides will have to compromise in good faith to get a deal done. He is frustrated that a deal hasn't been finalized because \"we've got this window of opportunity to get it done.\"\n\nWhile discussing what would have to happen to bring the fractured sport together, McIlroy invoked the Good Friday Agreement of April 10, 1998, which ended political unrest in Ireland and Northern Ireland that had occurred since the 1960s.\n\n\"Catholics weren't happy, Protestants weren't happy, but it brought peace, and then you just sort of learn to live with whatever has been negotiated, right?\" McIlroy said. \"That was in 1998 or whatever it was, and 20, 25, 30 years ahead, my generation doesn't know any different. It's just this is what it's always been like, and we've never known anything but peace.\n\n\"That's sort of my little, I guess, way of trying to think about it and trying to make both sides see that there could be a compromise here. Yeah, it's probably not going to feel great for either side, but if it's a place where the game of golf starts to thrive again and we can all get back together, then I think that's ultimately a really good thing.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Malnati", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Malnati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Ogilvie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Ogilvie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Monahan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jay Monahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Scott_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Scott (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Friday Agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protestantism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0415%2Fr1319110_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-14", "textStart": 232, "textEnd": 239}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-18", "textStart": 2074, "textEnd": 2082}, {"amb": false, "date": "1998-04-10", "textStart": 3327, "textEnd": 3341}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

Cantlay and Spieth have had past disputes with McIlroy over golf's future direction.\n\nMcIlroy had been expected to return after 2012 US Open winner Simpson said he was stepping down to spend more time with his family.\n\nInstead, according to McIlroy, Simpson will complete his term, which expires in 2025.\n\n\"I put my hand up to help and it was -- I wouldn't say it was rejected,\" McIlroy said. \"It was a complicated process to get through to put me back on there. So that's all fine, no hard feelings and we'll all move on.\"\n\nThe board remains in talks about finalizing a merger deal between the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) -- backers of the rival LIV Golf League -- from a framework agreement announced last June.\n\n\"I'm still optimistic,\" McIlroy said. \"I think Webb staying on is a really good thing. He has got a really balanced voice in all of this and I think he sees the bigger picture, which is great. My fear was if Webb stepped off and it wasn't me that was going in his place, what could potentially happen.\"\n\nTalks with an original December deadline have dragged months beyond, the frustrations of slow to no progress having been among the factors that sparked McIlroy's exit.\n\n\"I'm impatient because I think we've got this window of opportunity to get it done, because both sides from a business perspective I wouldn't say need to get it done, but it makes sense,\" McIlroy said.\n\nMcIlroy compared the situation to the Good Friday Agreement that ended unrest in Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\n\"Catholics weren't happy, Protestants weren't happy, but it brought peace and then you just sort of learn to live with whatever has been negotiated,\" McIlroy said.\n\n\"That's my little way of trying to think about it and trying to make both sides see that there could be a compromise here.

After some \"complicated\" and \"messy\" discussions, Simpson will see out his term which ends in 2025 after players voiced their concerns about McIlroy returning.\n\n\"There's been a lot of conversations,\" McIlroy said with a coy smile, noting how the discussions partly reminded him of why he left the policy board in the first place. \"It got pretty complicated and pretty messy and I think with the way it happened, I think it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before.\"\n\n\"There was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason,\" he added. \"I think the best course of action is if, you know, there's some people on there that aren't comfortable with me coming back on, then I think Webb just stays on and sees out his term, and I think he's gotten to a place where he's comfortable with doing that and I just sort of keep doing what I'm doing. I put my hand up to help and it was -- I wouldn't say it was rejected, it was a complicated process to get through to put me back on there. So that's all fine, no hard feelings and we'll all move on.\"\n\nSimpson contradicted McIlroy no less than an hour later and denied any negative sentiment towards the world No. 2's potential return to the board.\n\n\"I think the players on the board were very supportive of him being more involved, and in those conversations I think they all see the vital role he plays not only on the PGA Tour, but he's a DP World Tour member and they're such an important piece in the game of golf and our Tour,\" said Simpson, who also noted he didn't get any sense that McIlroy wasn't welcomed. \"So his perspective is tremendous to us. He's a global player, always has been, so I just think his views are important, and the other guys feel the same.\"\n\nRory McIlroy of Northern Ireland in action during the Pro Am event at Quail Hollow Country Club on May 09, 2024 in Charlotte, North Carolina. (Photo by Andrew Redington/Getty Images)\n\nMcIlroy, who has been on the front lines for the PGA Tour in its battle with LIV Golf, joined the board in 2022 and was supposed to serve out his term until the end of this year until he abruptly resigned late last fall. McIlroy was then replaced by Jordan Spieth via a board vote. After sticking up for the Tour for the better half of two years, his decision to bail on the board didn't sit well with his colleagues.\n\n\"He was very clear that it was too much for him. He had business dealings, he has a kid, he wants to focus on his game. Trust me, I get it. But once you quit, you're not getting back,\" Kevin Streelman, a former member of the policy board who ran against McIlroy for Player Advisory Council chairman, told Golfweek. \"I wouldn't quit on something that you were elected to by your peers. To want back in is peculiar.\"\n\nSince he left the board, McIlroy has been adamant and outspoken on why the Tour needs to get a deal done with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund - LIV's financial backer - in order to reunite the game.\n\n\"Golf and the PGA Tour has been so good to me over the years, I just feel like it's my obligation or duty to try to give back and try to set the next generation of players up like we were set up by the previous generation,\" McIlroy said of his reasoning to try and rejoin the board after stepping down. \"I think there's a responsibility with every generation to try to leave the Tour, leave the place that you're playing in a bit of a better spot than it was before. That's what it's about.\"\n\nDespite being stiff-armed out of consideration, McIlroy is \"still optimistic\" a deal will get done and believes Simpson staying on \"is a really good thing.\"\n\n\"I think he's got a really balanced voice in all of this and I think he sees the bigger picture, which is great,\" McIlroy explained. \"My fear was if Webb stepped off and it wasn't me that was going in his place, what could potentially happen.

After some \"complicated\" and \"messy\" discussions, Simpson will see out his term which ends in 2025 after players voiced their concerns about McIlroy returning.\n\n\"There's been a lot of conversations,\" McIlroy said with a coy smile, noting how the discussions partly reminded him of why he left the policy board in the first place. \"It got pretty complicated and pretty messy and I think with the way it happened, I think it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before.\"\n\n\"There was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason,\" he added. \"I think the best course of action is if, you know, there's some people on there that aren't comfortable with me coming back on, then I think Webb just stays on and sees out his term, and I think he's gotten to a place where he's comfortable with doing that and I just sort of keep doing what I'm doing.

He's a global player, always has been, so I just think his views are important, and the other guys feel the same.\"\n\nRory McIlroy of Northern Ireland in action during the Pro Am event at Quail Hollow Country Club on May 09, 2024 in Charlotte, North Carolina. (Photo by Andrew Redington/Getty Images)\n\nMcIlroy, who has been on the front lines for the PGA Tour in its battle with LIV Golf, joined the board in 2022 and was supposed to serve out his term until the end of this year until he abruptly resigned late last fall. McIlroy was then replaced by Jordan Spieth via a board vote. After sticking up for the Tour for the better half of two years, his decision to bail on the board didn't sit well with his colleagues.\n\n\"He was very clear that it was too much for him. He had business dealings, he has a kid, he wants to focus on his game. Trust me, I get it. But once you quit, you're not getting back,\" Kevin Streelman, a former member of the policy board who ran against McIlroy for Player Advisory Council chairman, told Golfweek. \"I wouldn't quit on something that you were elected to by your peers. To want back in is peculiar.\"\n\nSince he left the board, McIlroy has been adamant and outspoken on why the Tour needs to get a deal done with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund - LIV's financial backer - in order to reunite the game.\n\n\"Golf and the PGA Tour has been so good to me over the years, I just feel like it's my obligation or duty to try to give back and try to set the next generation of players up like we were set up by the previous generation,\" McIlroy said of his reasoning to try and rejoin the board after stepping down. \"I think there's a responsibility with every generation to try to leave the Tour, leave the place that you're playing in a bit of a better spot than it was before. That's what it's about.\"\n\nDespite being stiff-armed out of consideration, McIlroy is \"still optimistic\" a deal will get done and believes Simpson staying on \"is a really good thing.\"\n\n\"I think he's got a really balanced voice in all of this and I think he sees the bigger picture, which is great,\" McIlroy explained. \"My fear was if Webb stepped off and it wasn't me that was going in his place, what could potentially happen. Yeah, I'm really happy that Webb has made that decision to stay on and serve out the rest of his term.\"\n\nAs a 35-year-old from Northern Ireland, McIlroy made an interesting comparison of the current state of professional golf to the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland and Ireland in the 1990s.\n\n\"I would say I'm impatient because I think we've got this window of opportunity to get (a deal) done, because both sides from a business perspective I wouldn't say need to get it done, but it makes sense,\" he explained. \"I sort of liken it to like when Northern Ireland went through the peace process in the '90s and the Good Friday Agreement, neither side was happy.

Now, it appears the board is resisting Rory McIlroy's return.\n\nMcIlroy told reporters Wednesday the process for his return was complicated and not all parties supported it after McIlroy resigned from his own board seat just six months earlier. In turn, Webb Simpson, the man who hoped to step down to let McIlroy back in, is expected to keep his board seat for the remainder of his term.\n\n\"I think there was -- there was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason,\" McIlroy said after a pro-am round at the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte. \"I think the best course of action is if, you know, there's some people on there that aren't comfortable with me coming back on, then I think Webb just stays on and sees out his term, and I think he's gotten to a place where he's comfortable with doing that and I just sort of keep doing what I'm doing.\"\n\nMcIlroy was the most vocal and public face of the PGA Tour in its war against LIV -- often criticizing the Saudi-funded league and players who left the PGA Tour to join it -- until the tour surprisingly announced a framework agreement to team up with the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia on June 6, 2023. After that announcement, he referred to himself as a \"sacrificial lamb\" and took a large step back from his prominent public role. He resigned from the PGA Tour policy board in November, and Jordan Spieth took his place.\n\nThe policy board is a collection of 11 voting members that help decide the future of the PGA Tour with six seats reserved for player directors. Shortly after McIlroy's resignation, Sports Illustrated reported McIlroy (who was primarily fighting to spread wealth throughout the tour) lost a power battle to the bloc of Patrick Cantlay, Tiger Woods and Spieth, all of whom were pushing for more money and power for top players.\n\nSince his departure, McIlroy has reactivated his voice but shifted his message toward unification with LIV and bringing all the best players together. He rubbed people the wrong way, criticizing Spieth publicly for saying the PGA Tour didn't \"need\" the Saudis. He consistently made comments about the desire for money ruining the sport. He then got in an awkward incident at the Players Championship with playing partners Spieth and Viktor Hovland.\n\nMcIlroy rejoining the board would have undoubtedly created an interesting dynamic.\n\n\"I think it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before,\" McIlroy said Wednesday.\n\nWhen reports first surfaced about Simpson's letter of resignation at the Zurich Classic in April, McIlroy said of a potential return: \"I think I can be helpful. I don't think there's been much progress made in the last eight months, and I was hopeful that there would be.\"\n\nAt the time, most assumed McIlroy's return would be a simple process, but there isn't much if any precedent for a board member requesting who takes their place. McIlroy made several comments acknowledging the need for the board to approve it.\n\n\"But only if people want me involved, I guess,\" he said. \"When Webb and I talked and he talked about potentially coming off the board, I said, look, if it was something that other people wanted, I would gladly take that seat, and that was the conversation that we had.\"\n\nMcIlroy said his return wasn't completely rejected, but the process was complicated and there's no hard feelings. He remains optimistic a deal with PIF will get done, in part because Simpson is keeping his board seat.\n\n\"I think he's got a really balanced voice in all of this and I think he sees the bigger picture, which is great,\" McIlroy said. \"My fear was if Webb stepped off and it wasn't me that was going in his place, what could potentially happen.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brody_miller@theathletic.com", "name": "Brody Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Hovland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Hovland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Players_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Players Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich_Classic_of_New_Orleans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zurich Classic of New Orleans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/04/16132047/GettyImages-2148633226-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

That deal could be worth as much as $3 billion.\n\n\"I put my hand up to help and it was, I wouldn't say it was rejected, (but) it was a complicated process to get through to put me back on there,\" McIlroy said of potentially returning the board. \"So that's all fine, no hard feelings and we'll all move on.\"\n\nSimpson said he now plans to finish out his three-year term on the board. He said he offered to give up his seat to McIlroy because he's a \"global superstar\" and would give Europeans a needed voice in major tour decisions.\n\n\"Rory always had great ideas of how do we move forward, how do we get the love and attention from fans back from where we had it maybe two years ago, how do we grow our business, all things related to the PGA Tour,\" Simpson said.\n\nBut there are some on the board who remain at odds with the four-time major champion after McIlroy changed his views about LIV Golf in recent months, suggesting that LIV players be allowed to return to the PGA Tour without penalty.\n\nMcIlroy also disagreed in February with Jordan Spieth's comments that a deal with PIF was not needed because of the SSG investment, although it would help with unification.\n\nMcIlroy suggested one solution for growing the game would be going to a more global schedule that includes more tournaments overseas, although he questioned whether American players would want to travel out of the United States for a dozen events.\n\nRegardless, McIlroy remains bothered by the state of the game and wants to see a resolution for the good of the fans, a growing faction of which have become unhappy -- or even worse, apathetic -- with the splintering of players on two watered-down tours.\n\nMcIlroy said it's all about finding a compromise for both sides, even though neither side may walk away completely happy.\n\n\"I would say I'm impatient because I think we've got this window of opportunity to get it done, because both sides from a business perspective ...

McIlroy and Spieth have had their issues, too. The pair were grouped with Viktor Hovland for the opening round of the Players Championship in March, and it proved to be an eventful round with intense clashes over two drops that McIlroy took when his tee shots found the water.\n\nA month before that episode, McIlroy did not approve of Spieth's comments when the American said the PGA Tour did not \"need\" to go into business with the PIF after a \u00a32.4 billion deal was agreed with Strategic Sports Group (SSG). Half of that money has already been doled out to PGA Tour members as part of an equity scheme.\n\nSpieth added: \"I think the positive [of a deal with PIF] would be a unification [of PGA Tour and LIV players], but I just think it's something that is almost not even worth talking about right this second,\" said Spieth, who assumed a seat on the board vacated late last year by Rory McIlroy. \"The idea is that we have a strategic partner that allows the PGA Tour to go forward the way that it's operating right now without anything else.\"\n\nMcIlroy believed the comments were unhelpful to negotiations over a deal that could see the stars of the PGA Tour and LIV Golf play together more often. So much so that McIlroy was minded to leave a text chain of PGA Tour players in response. According to Golf Digest, the pair had an hour-long chat afterwards to clear the air.\n\nMcIlroy said of Spieth's comments at the time: \"My thing was if I'm the original [potential] investor that thought that they were going to get this deal done back in July, and I'm hearing a board member say that we don't really need them now, how are they going to think about that, what are they going to feel about that?\n\n\"They are still sitting out there with hundreds of billions of dollars, if not trillions, that they're going to pour it into sport.

Speaking ahead of the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship, the 35-year-old outlined resistance he has faced since being asked by Webb Simpson to take his seat on the board in what would have been a return to a position McIlroy held before his resignation last November.\n\nIt was later confirmed McIlroy has taken his name out of board consideration, according to Golf Channel.\n\n\"There's been a lot of conversations,\" McIlroy said. \"Sort of reminded me partly why I didn't [want to be on the board]. ... It got pretty complicated and pretty messy, and I think with the way it happened, I think it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before.\n\n\"There was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason. I think the best course of action is if, you know, there's some people on there that aren't comfortable with me coming back on, then I think Webb just stays on and sees out his term, and I think he's gotten to a place where he's comfortable with doing that and I just sort of keep doing what I'm doing.\n\n\"So yeah, I put my hand up to help, and it was -- I wouldn't say it was rejected, it was a complicated process to get through to put me back on there. So that's all fine, no hard feelings, and we'll all move on.\"\n\nSimpson requested McIlroy take his seat on both the PGA Tour and PGA Tour Enterprises boards, The Guardian reported in April. Simpson's three-year term is set to run through 2025, and after conversations and pushback, Simpson and McIlroy both confirmed Wednesday at Quail Hollow Club that Simpson will serve out the remainder of this term.\n\nThere are suggestions that Patrick Cantlay, notably in this report from from Golfweek, is among the \"subset\" of the board who pushed back on McIlroy's return. McIlroy and Cantlay recently had a spat on the golf course when Cantlay's caddie, Joe LaCava, and McIlroy yelled at each other during the 2023 Ryder Cup. The Northern Irishman has spoken about his outburst in Rome and detailed his less-than-friendly relationship with Cantlay.\n\nEver since softening his stance on LIV Golf, McIlroy has been adamant that a deal needs to be struck between the PGA Tour and LIV Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, the financial backers of LIV. Pitching the idea of a world tour and a Champions League-type circuit consisting of the world's best players, McIlroy's ideas have been met with blank stares.\n\nRory believes a point of contention could be American golfers being unwilling to play 12 international tournaments a year. McIlroy also believes some may have a sour taste in their mouth should players from LIV Golf return after receiving generous contracts to jump to the 54-hole league.\n\nMcIlroy remains positive despite being boxed out of the board and despite the lack of progress since the June 6, 2023, framework agreement announcement between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf that has yet to bear fruit despite an initial deadline of New Year's Eve.\n\n\"I'm still optimistic,\" McIlroy said. \"I think Webb staying on is a really good thing. I think he's got a really balanced voice in all of this, and I think he sees the bigger picture, which is great. My fear was, if Webb stepped off and it wasn't me that was going in his place, what could potentially happen. Yeah, I'm really happy that Webb has made that decision to stay on and serve out the rest of his term.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "patrick_mcdonald@cbssports.com", "name": "Patrick McDonald", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_Channel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golfweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golfweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/03/11/b7e424ec-e13d-40ab-b652-013e228b24d2/thumbnail/1200x675/d12a56cbf54c053eec1a1d788e05ab8e/rory-mcilroy-usatsi-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Catholics weren't happy, Protestants weren't happy, but it brought peace and then you just sort of learn to live with whatever has been negotiated, right?\n\n\"That was in 1998 or whatever it was and 20, 25, 30 years ahead, my generation doesn't know any different. It's just this is what it's always been like and we've never known anything but peace. That's sort of my little way of trying to think about it and trying to make both sides see that there could be a compromise here.\n\n\"Yeah, it's probably not going to feel great for either side, but if it's a place where the game of golf starts to thrive again and we can all get back together, then I think that's ultimately a really good thing.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_frost@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Sam Frost", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA European Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talor_Gooch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Talor Gooch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Good Friday Agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_peace_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland peace process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protestantism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32765287.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Mcilroy-policy.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

It's a hot debate", "body": "Rory McIlroy watches a tee shot during the Zurich Classic in April.\n\nIn any other year in the history of pro golf, it may have been simple to slide Rory McIlroy back into a leadership position on the PGA Tour, but this is not just any old year. It's 2024, where the PGA Tour has created its own, for-profit company. Where it accepted $1.5 billion from some of the biggest sports investors in the world. Where other, untold billions are, in theory at least, on the table via Saudi Arabia.\n\nUnfortunately for McIlroy, a man who wants to meet the gravity of all that listed above, he will not have a clearly defined seat on the PGA Tour Policy Board. (At least not yet.)\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Guardian's Ewen Murray reported Webb Simpson tendered his resignation from the board and requested McIlroy, who resigned from the policy board just five months ago, fill his spot. But on Wednesday, as the PGA Tour readies for a Signature Event at Quail Hollow, we learned there'd been a hiccup since. Although Simpson, one of six player directors, had deemed McIlroy his exclusive choice to replace him, that's not necessarily how things work. At least not during the most tense years of the board's existence.\n\n\"It got pretty complicated and pretty messy,\" McIlroy said Wednesday at the Wells Fargo Championship. \"I think with the way it happened, it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before.\n\n\"There was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on, for some reason.\"\n\nMcIlroy didn't name names, but it is no secret that he and a few board members have had their disagreements in the last year. It was just three months ago that McIlroy had an hour-long phone call with Jordan Spieth in response to dismissive comments Spieth made regarding the need for a deal with the Saudi PIF.\n\nMcIlroy and Patrick Cantlay have also been at odds at times. And not just during the 18th-hole melee at the Ryder Cup in Rome. McIlroy admitted in an interview in December that his relationship with Cantlay is \"average at best,\" and that \"we don't have a ton in common and see the world quite differently.\"\n\nThat could be part of what McIlroy was up against when he raised his hand to take Simpson's spot. When McIlroy gave up his own seat on the board, late last year, it was the other player directors who agreed unanimously to give that position to Spieth. Anything less than unanimous agreement is an issue, considering the player directors, for the first time, have been signing letters to the membership as a group. Nothing is happening on the policy board without consent from every player director.\n\nThe issue is that the board isn't exactly advancing the Tour (at least publicly) toward a more stable future with any sort of pace. Most player directors have been coy about the negotiations. Tour commissioner Jay Monahan was particularly vague when he addressed the media in his annual state-of-the-union press conference. Meanwhile, the Tour's television audience has regularly dipped at most tournaments this year, inclusive of the year's first major, the Masters. Fans are unquestionably fatigued, and many PGA Tour members are as well. McIlroy is unafraid to voice his opinions and attach his name to them, which puts him on a pretty short list among the game's elite. But not everyone in the Tour membership agrees with those opinions, so not everyone agrees with the idea of McIlroy getting his spot back on the board.\n\nWe do know one thing, though -- he has Simpson's endorsement, even if he won't have his board seat. Simpson said he now intends to continue forward through the remaining 20 months of his term and will clearly work to keep McIlroy closely involved. He just couldn't explain the position of McIlroy very coherently Wednesday morning.\n\n\"I think the sentiment was Rory McIlroy, being the global superstar that he is and the strong voice that he has in the game of golf, it would be great to get him involved more,\" Simpson said. \"So, you know, what capacity is he going to get involved more? I think three weeks ago we just wanted him more involved, and I think I've seen support from the guys on wanting him more involved and helping. All he has said to me is I just want to help if you guys want me to help. So we're thankful that he wants to help. He has, like I said, an important voice and I think he's already made a positive impact the last week in his role.\"\n\nThose last two words are telling, even if they aren't detailed. His role. Simpson did not explain what \"his role\" means for McIlroy, but it would appear to be some form of an advisor. Perhaps adjacent to various committees in charge of making progress toward reunification. McIlroy understands the structures of the business, is tight with the SSG investment group, has very close ties to the DP World Tour -- McIlroy is in the process of moving to London -- and believes the highest ceiling of pro golf involves the best players in the world playing a lot of golf in America, but also leaving those comforts of home and bringing the Tour abroad more often. That was the first thing that came to mind Wednesday, when McIlroy was asked for potential compromises the Tour may have to make to reach an investment deal with the Saudi PIF and reunite with players on LIV Golf.\n\n\"If we go to more of a global schedule,\" McIlroy began, \"do the American players that are used to playing all their golf in America want to travel outside of the States 12 times a year to play tournament golf, you know? That's a consideration.\"\n\nAnd one McIlroy has been talking about for months. You can hear it in how smoothly he utters those words. He's said them before, many times, not necessarily in front of a microphone. It's his view of golf's greatest future, but one he knows may never actually happen. Which is why he considers now to be a moment of opportunity that may pass. Due to resigning his board seat last year, McIlroy is in less of a position to make it happen, but the last few weeks make it seem he is in more of a position than he was two months ago.\n\n\"His perspective is tremendous to us,\" Simpson said. \"He's a global player, always has been, so I just think his views are important, and the other guys feel the same.\n\n\"We kind of had to figure out, OK, where is his place -- how can we honor our role as board members and our commitment to the Tour, but also bring in a guy at least to voice his ideas and just see how he can help us.\"", "source": {"uri": "golf.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewen_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ewen Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich_Classic_of_New_Orleans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zurich Classic of New Orleans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Monahan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jay Monahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA European Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://golf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ror.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

(AP) - Rory McIlroy won\u00b4t be returning to the PGA Tour board, saying Wednesday that a plan to replace Webb Simpson was met with resistance from board members.\n\nSimpson, one of six player-directors, recently offered to give up his seat - but only if McIlroy were to replace him. McIlroy would have needed board approval to be reinstated to a position that he resigned from last November.\n\nBut McIlroy said ahead of the Wells Fargo Championship that conversations surrounding his potential return became \"pretty complicated and messy,\" which reminded him of why he left in the first place.\n\n\"I think with the way it happened it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before,\" McIlroy said. \"I think there was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason.\"\n\nMcIlroy\u00b4s reinstatement would have been viewed as a chance to help improve the PGA Tour\u00b4s stalled negotiations with the Saudi financial backers of LIV Golf.\n\nThe world\u00b4s No. 2 player said when he stepped down he could no longer commit the time and energy that board work required with the PGA Tour trying to finalize an agreement with the Public Investment Fund.\n\nRory McIlroy, of Northern Ireland, reacts after making birdie on the 16th hole during the final round of the PGA Zurich Classic golf tournament at TPC Louisiana in Avondale, La., Sunday, April 28, 2024. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)\n\nUnable to finalize a deal by the end of last year, the PGA Tour brought in Strategic Sports Group as a minority investor. That deal could be worth as much as $3 billion.\n\n\"I put my hand up to help and it was, I wouldn\u00b4t say it was rejected, (but) it was a complicated process to get through to put me back on there,\" McIlroy said of potentially returning the board. \"So that\u00b4s all fine, no hard feelings and we\u00b4ll all move on.\"\n\nSimpson said he now plans to finish out his three-year term on the board. He said he offered to give up his seat to McIlroy because he\u00b4s a \"global superstar\" and would give Europeans a needed voice in major tour decisions.\n\n\"Rory always had great ideas of how do we move forward, how do we get the love and attention from fans back from where we had it maybe two years ago, how do we grow our business, all things related to the PGA Tour,\" Simpson said.\n\nBut there are some on the board who remain at odds with the four-time major champion after McIlroy changed his views about LIV Golf in recent months, suggesting that LIV players be allowed to return to the PGA Tour without penalty.\n\nMcIlroy also disagreed in February with Jordan Spieth\u00b4s comments that a deal with PIF was not needed because of the SSG investment, although it would help with unification.\n\nMcIlroy suggested one solution for growing the game would be going to a more global schedule that includes more tournaments overseas, although he questioned whether American players would want to travel out of the United States for a dozen events.\n\nRegardless, McIlroy remains bothered by the state of the game and wants to see a resolution for the good of the fans, a growing faction of which have become unhappy - or even worse, apathetic - with the splintering of players on two watered-down tours.\n\nMcIlroy said it's all about finding a compromise for both sides, even though neither side may walk away completely happy.\n\n\"I would say I\u00b4m impatient because I think we\u00b4ve got this window of opportunity to get it done, because both sides from a business perspective ... I wouldn\u00b4t say need to get it done, but it makes sense,\" McIlroy said. \"And I just think - I sort of liken it to like when Northern Ireland went through the peace process in the \u00b490s and the Good Friday Agreement, neither side was happy. Catholics weren\u00b4t happy, Protestants weren\u00b4t happy, but it brought peace and then you just sort of learn to live with whatever has been negotiated, right?\"\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf\n\nRory McIlroy, of Northern Ireland, standing, and his teammate Shane Lowry, of Ireland, line up a shot on the 17th green during the final round of the PGA Zurich Classic golf tournament at TPC Louisiana in Avondale, La., Sunday, April 28, 2024.

Days later, McIlroy appeared open to the possibility, saying before the Zurich Classic of New Orleans: \"I think I can be helpful.\"\n\nMcIlroy is preparing for his first start since victory at TPC Louisiana at this week's Wells Fargo Championship, where he addressed the latest on his potential return.\n\nHe said: \"Yeah, there's been a lot of conversations. Sort of reminded me partly why I didn't. So yeah, I think it just, it got pretty complicated and pretty messy and I think with the way it happened, I think it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before.\"\n\nMcIlroy resigned from the Policy Board in November, but he has still been vocal on the current state of the game, particularly with regard to the PGA Tour's protracted negotiations with the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) behind LIV Golf. On that issue, he also said of LIV golfers who may wish to return to the PGA Tour: \"Let them come back.\"\n\nThat sentiment was not shared by everyone, including the player who replaced McIlroy on the board, Jordan Spieth, and the 35-year-old suggested not everyone was willing to welcome him back.\n\nHe continued: \"So yeah, I think there was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason.\n\n\"Yeah, I think the best course of action is if, you know, there's some people on there that aren't comfortable with me coming back on, then I think Webb just stays on and sees out his term, and I think he's gotten to a place where he's comfortable with doing that and I just sort of keep doing what I'm doing.\"\n\nMcIlroy then turned his attention to the need to bring a positive conclusion to the negotiations between the PGA Tour and PIF. He said: \"We've got this window of opportunity to get it done, because both sides from a business perspective I wouldn't say need to get it done, but it makes sense.\n\n\"It's probably not going to feel great for either side, but if it's a place where the game of golf starts to thrive again and we can all get back together, then I think that's ultimately a really good thing.\"\n\nHowever, McIlroy admitted potential sticking points remain. He said: \"It could be if we go to more of a global schedule, do the American players that are used to playing all their golf in America want to travel outside of the States 12 times a year to play tournament golf, you know?

This is a guy who'd work until 3am on board meetings and then get up for a pro-am. I think his voice will be really important to make sure we get all the right people to the negotiating table.\"\n\nMonahan: McIlroy's perspective \"important\" to PGA Tour\n\nSimpson explained on Wednesday that the board wanted McIlroy to be \"not necessarily in every conversation but in more conversations\", while PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan insisted that he still has a key voice in the sport.\n\nIn a statement to Golf Channel, Monahan said: \"Today's news is in no way a commentary on Rory's important perspective and influence. It's simply a matter of adherence to our governance process by which a PGA Tour player become a board member.\n\n\"Webb [Simpson] remaining in his position as a member of the policy board and PGA Tour Enterprises board through the end of his term provides the continuity needed at this important time.\n\n\"We are making progress in our negotiations with the PIF and are working as a collective - the players directors, our boards and Tour management - to remain open-minded to all avenues that advance the PGA Tour in the best interests of our players, our partners and our fans.\"\n\nWatch Rory McIlroy in action at the Wells Fargo Championship and the PGA Championship this month live on Sky Sports.

So that's all fine, no hard feelings and we'll all move on.\"\n\nIt's no secret that board member Patrick Cantlay and McIlroy do not share some of the same beliefs and have had their differences. The other player directors on the board are Tiger Woods, Adam Scott, Peter Malnati and Jordan Spieth, who replaced McIlroy late last year.\n\nMcIlroy has said on several occasions that he believes a deal with the PIF -- which backs LIV Golf -- is necessary and that he's frustrated by the lack of movement.\n\nIt's been nearly a year since the controversial \"framework agreement\" between the PGA Tour, DP World Tour and PIF was announced. The Tour has since made a deal with Strategic Sports Group for up to $3 billion in investment, with a complicated plan to give players equity.\n\nBut nothing has happened with the PIF as LIV continues to plan for the future with several prominent players.\n\nAnd McIlroy went so far as to invoke the Good Friday Agreement -- which greatly impacted political matters in his homeland of Northern Ireland -- as an example of why getting to any sort of common ground is difficult.\n\n\"I think we've got this window of opportunity to get it done, because both sides from a business perspective I wouldn't say need to get it done, but it makes sense,'' McIlroy said. \"I sort of liken it to like when Northern Ireland went through the peace process in the '90s and the Good Friday Agreement, neither side was happy. Catholics weren't happy, Protestants weren't happy, but it brought peace and then you just sort of learn to live with whatever has been negotiated, right?\n\n\"That was in 1998 or whatever it was and 20, 25, 30 years ahead, my generation doesn't know any different. It's just this is what it's always been like and we've never known anything but peace. That's sort my little way of trying to think about it and trying to make both sides see that there could be a compromise here. Yeah, it's probably not going to feel great for either side, but if it's a place where the game of golf starts to thrive again and we can all get back together, then I think that's ultimately a really good thing.\"\n\nSimpson said Wednesday that he would remain for the duration of his three-year term but simply wanted more input from McIlroy. They've spoken several times and Simpson believed there was a way to get him back on the board -- even if that won't happen now.\n\n\"I think the sentiment was that Rory McIlroy being the global superstar he is and the strong voice in the game of golf, it'll be great to get him more involved,\" Simpson said. \"All he has said to me is I just want to help if you guys want me to help. He has an important voice. I think he's already made a positive impact this week.\"\n\nMcIlroy said he is glad Simpson is remaining. \"He has a really balanced voice in all this,\" he said.\n\nAsked what some of the holdups to a deal might be, McIlroy gave several examples.\n\n\"It could be if we go to a more global schedule, do the American players that are used to playing all their golf in American want to travel outside of the States 12 times a year to play tournament golf? That's a consideration,\" he said.\n\n\"If we all sort of come back together, I think from the LIV contingent there's only seven players over there who have status, still have status or eligibility here. But would it be palatable to the rest of the membership if they come back -- after seeing their contract out and they've financially got ahead by potentially hundreds of millions over the people who stayed. That's a consideration.\n\n\"If you're just thinking about the big picture and what's good for the game of golf and what's good for the Tom Kims of the world in 10 or 15 years' time and they're still playing professional golf, you want to set it up in a way where those younger guys have all the same opportunities if not more opportunities than we've had.\n\n\"So it's not really about the here and.

Henry of Fenway Sports Group and Joe Ogilvie, a former Tour player appointed as a director liaison in March.\n\nThe subcommittee reports back to the full board.\n\nThe developments capped a day that began with Rory McIlroy losing the inside track on rejoining the board as Webb Simpson's replacement when board members resisted his return.\n\n\"I think there was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason,\" McIlroy said at the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, North Carolina, where a $20 million signature event is being played.\n\nAfter 'very messy' conversations, Rory McIlroy moving on from policy board return\n\nMcIlroy had been trying to re-join the PGA Tour's policy board after initially stepping down last November.\n\nSimpson had offered to resign, but only if McIlroy were to replace him. When a player director resigns, the other players on the board have to unanimously agree on a successor. McIlroy resigned from the board in November, and the players selected Jordan Spieth to replace him.\n\nThe seven players -- Woods, Spieth, Simpson, Ogilvie, Patrick Cantlay, Adam Scott and Peter Malnati -- are on the board of the PGA Tour and PGA Tour Enterprises, the commercial entity that agreed to a deal with Strategic Sports Group as a minority investor.\n\nThat deal included a $1.5 billion investment, which could be as much as $3 billion.\n\nMcIlroy was willing to return, believing he could help find a solution to the split in golf that has left some of the best players on two tours. McIlroy sees the reunification in some form as the ultimate goal and rubbed players the wrong way when he suggested earlier this year that LIV players return without punishment.\n\n\"Today's news is in no way a commentary on Rory's important perspective and influence,\" Monahan said in a statement. \"It's simple a matter of adherence to our governance process by which a tour player becomes a board member.\n\n\"Webb remaining in his position as a member of the policy board and PGA Tour Enterprises board through the end of his term provides the continuity needed at this vital time,\" he said. \"We are making progress in our negotiations with the PIF.\"\n\nMcIlroy is certain to stay involved in an unofficial capacity based on his experience of two years on the board and his voice in the game. He was the only DP World Tour member on the PGA Tour board, and McIlroy has cultivated relationships across continents during his career.\n\nHe had said on a British soccer podcast at the start of this year that he met with the PIF governor, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, at the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai in late 2022 and that he returned home and encouraged the Tour board to meet with him.\n\nThe framework agreement among the PGA Tour, European tour and PIF was announced June 6, with a deadline to finalize it by the end of 2023.

Simpson has voiced similar opinions.\n\nOther board members, including Jordan Spieth and Tiger Woods, have been vocal about the tour not needing a deal to go through with PIF now that it has funding from Strategic Sports Group.

The subcommittee will handle day-to-day talks as PIF seeks to become a minority investor.\n\nAlso on the subcommittee are PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan, board chairman Joe Gorder, John W. Henry of Fenway Sports Group and Joe Ogilvie, a former tour player appointed as a director liaison in March.\n\nThe subcommittee reports back to the full board.\n\nTiger Woods will be the sole player involved in negotiations with the Public Investment Fund\n\nPGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan (pictured) will also be on the subcommittee\n\nThe developments capped a day that began with Rory McIlroy losing the inside track on rejoining the board as Webb Simpson's replacement when board members resisted his return.\n\nRead More Rory McIlroy will NOT return to PGA Tour board after 'old wounds' reopened in 'messy' discussions\n\n'I think there was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason,' McIlroy said at the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, North Carolina, where a $20 million signature event is being played.\n\nSimpson had offered to resign, but only if McIlroy were to replace him. When a player director resigns, the other players on the board have to unanimously agree on a successor. McIlroy resigned from the board in November, and the players selected Jordan Spieth to replace him.\n\nThe seven players - Woods, Spieth, Simpson, Ogilvie, Patrick Cantlay, Adam Scott and Peter Malnati - are on the board of the PGA Tour and PGA Tour Enterprises, the commercial entity that agreed to a deal with Strategic Sports Group as a minority investor.\n\nThat deal included a $1.5 billion investment, which could be as much as $3 billion.\n\nMcIlroy was willing to return, believing he could help find a solution to the split in golf that has left some of the best players on two tours. McIlroy sees the reunification in some form as the ultimate goal and rubbed players the wrong way when he suggested earlier this year that LIV players return without punishment.\n\nYasir Al-Rumayyan is governor of the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia\n\n'Today's news is in no way a commentary on Rory's important perspective and influence,' Monahan said in a statement. 'It's simple a matter of adherence to our governance process by which a tour player becomes a board member.\n\n'Webb remaining in his position as a member of the policy board and PGA Tour Enterprises board through the end of his term provides the continuity needed at this vital time,' he said. 'We are making progress in our negotiations with the PIF.'\n\nMcIlroy is certain to stay involved in an unofficial capacity based on his experience of two years on the board and his voice in the game. He was the only European tour member on the PGA Tour board, and McIlroy has cultivated relationships across continents during his career.\n\nHe had said on a British soccer podcast at the start of this year that he met with the PIF governor, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, at the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai in late 2022 and that he returned home and encouraged the tour board to meet with him.\n\nRory McIlroy will not return to PGA Tour board after 'old wounds' reopened in 'messy' talks\n\nThe framework agreement among the PGA Tour, European tour and PIF was announced June 6, with a deadline to finalize it by the end of 2023.

So yeah, I think it just got pretty complicated and pretty messy, and I think with the way it happened, I think it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before. I think there was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason. Yeah, I think that the best course of action is if, you know, there's some people on there that aren't comfortable with me coming back on, then I think Webb [Simpson] just stays on and sees out his term, and I think he's gotten to a place where he's comfortable with doing that and I just sort of keep doing what I'm doing.\n\n\"So yeah, I put my hand up to help and I wouldn't say it was rejected, it was a complicated process to get through to put me back on there. So that's all fine, no hard feelings and we'll all move on.\"\n\nMcIlroy abruptly stepped down as a player director last November, telling reporters, \"I've got a lot going on in my life.\" Jordan Spieth was appointed to serve out the remainder of McIlroy's term, which expires at the end of this year.\n\nBut last month it was reported by The Guardian that McIlroy was contemplating a return to the board. Prior to the Zurich Classic, McIlroy explained that he had discussed with Webb Simpson about taking Simpson's spot, though such transfer would have to be approved by the other board members.\n\n\"I think I can be helpful,\" McIlroy said in New Orleans. \"I don't think there's been much progress made in the last eight months, and I was hopeful that there would be. I think I could be helpful to the process ... but only if people want me involved, I guess. When Webb and I talked, and he talked about potentially coming off the board, I said, 'Look, if it was something that other people wanted, I would gladly take that seat.'\"\n\nThough that's now not likely to happen, McIlroy says he remains optimistic with Simpson and his \"balanced voice\" still at the table.\n\n\"My fear was if Webb stepped off and it wasn't me that was going in his place, what could potentially happen,\" McIlroy added.\n\nMcIlroy has been a proponent of a deal getting done between the PGA Tour and the Saudi-backed LIV Golf. He reiterated his opinion on Tuesday, saying that it makes sense for both sides to come to an agreement, even if it means both sides are \"probably not going to feel great.\" As examples, McIlroy pointed to a potential shift to a more global competition schedule and how some players comfortable with playing only in the U.S. might not want to travel, or how some Tour members would feel if LIV players still with status are welcomed back to the Tour after collections, in some cases, hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n\"But if it's a place where the game of golf starts to thrive again and we can all get back together,\" McIlroy added, \"then I think that's ultimately a really good thing.\"\n\nMeanwhile, McIlroy will just keep doing what he's doing.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich_Classic_of_New_Orleans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zurich Classic of New Orleans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a22140a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4788x2693+0+451/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fbe%2F0d%2F8ad9b7fd4176b8e8ff84bff3df1e%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2152038945", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Henry of Fenway Sports Group and Joe Ogilvie, a former Tour player appointed as a director liaison in March.\n\nThe subcommittee reports back to the full board.\n\nThe developments capped a day that began with Rory McIlroy losing the inside track on rejoining the board as Webb Simpson's replacement when board members resisted his return.\n\n\"I think there was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason,\" McIlroy said at the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, North Carolina, where a $20 million signature event is being played.\n\nSimpson had offered to resign, but only if McIlroy were to replace him. When a player director resigns, the other players on the board have to unanimously agree on a successor. McIlroy resigned from the board in November, and the players selected Jordan Spieth to replace him.\n\nThe seven players -- Woods, Spieth, Simpson, Ogilvie, Patrick Cantlay, Adam Scott and Peter Malnati -- are on the board of the PGA Tour and PGA Tour Enterprises, the commercial entity that agreed to a deal with Strategic Sports Group as a minority investor.\n\nThat deal included a $1.5 billion investment, which could be as much as $3 billion.\n\nMcIlroy was willing to return, believing he could help find a solution to the split in golf that has left some of the best players on two tours. McIlroy sees the reunification in some form as the ultimate goal and rubbed players the wrong way when he suggested earlier this year that LIV players return without punishment.\n\n\"Today's news is in no way a commentary on Rory's important perspective and influence,\" Monahan said in a statement. \"It's simple a matter of adherence to our governance process by which a tour player becomes a board member.\n\n\"Webb remaining in his position as a member of the policy board and PGA Tour Enterprises board through the end of his term provides the continuity needed at this vital time,\" he said. \"We are making progress in our negotiations with the PIF.\"\n\nMcIlroy is certain to stay involved in an unofficial capacity based on his experience of two years on the board and his voice in the game. He was the only DP World Tour member on the PGA Tour board, and McIlroy has cultivated relationships across continents during his career.\n\nHe had said on a British soccer podcast at the start of this year that he met with the PIF governor, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, at the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai in late 2022 and that he returned home and encouraged the Tour board to meet with him.\n\nThe framework agreement among the PGA Tour, European tour and PIF was announced June 6, with a deadline to finalize it by the end of 2023. Negotiations continue with little progress.\n\nWoods was among the player directors who went to the Bahamas on March 18 -- Monahan and Henry also attended -- to meet with Al-Rumayyan.\n\nWoods said at the Masters about that meeting, \"I don't know if we're closer, but certainly we're headed in the right direction. That was a very positive meeting, and I think both sides came away from the meeting feeling positive.\"\n\nGorder is the chairman and CEO of Valero, the title sponsor of the Texas Open.

On Wednesday, it was revealed that the PGA Tour have put out five members to represent them at the table with 15-time major champion Woods the only player.\n\nElsewhere the American-based circuit's commissioner Jay Monahan will also take a negotiation spot, along with policy board chairman Joe Gorder, Fenway Sports Group (FSG) principal owner John Henry and former player-turned-economist Joe Ogilvie.\n\nREAD MORE: YouTube golf capitalises on LIV Golf fallout - and the PGA Tour has listened\n\nREAD MORE: Rory McIlroy battling conflicting emotions as big gesture reveals true PGA Tour feelings\n\nWoods is a member of the Tour's policy board as a player director, a role taken up by his close friend and business partner Rory McIlroy until last November.

I think it got pretty complicated and pretty messy and I think with the way it happened, I think it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before. There was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason.\n\n\"I think the best course of action is if there are some people on there that aren't comfortable with me coming back on. It was reported by the Guardian in April that Simpson was set to stand aside from his post to allow McIlroy to return, but the American has since opted to remain.\n\n\"I think he [Webb] has gotten to a place where he's comfortable with doing that and I just sort of keep doing what I'm doing,\" McIlroy added. \"I put my hand up to help and it was -- I wouldn't say it was rejected, it was a complicated process to get through to put me back on there.

Henry of Fenway Sports Group and Joe Ogilvie, a former tour player appointed as a director liaison in March.\n\nThe subcommittee reports back to the full board.\n\nThe developments capped a day that began with Rory McIlroy losing the inside track on rejoining the board as Webb Simpson's replacement when board members resisted his return.\n\nRory McIlroy, of Northern Ireland, reacts after making birdie on the 16th hole during the final round of the PGA Zurich Classic golf tournament at TPC Louisiana in Avondale, La., Sunday, April 28, 2024. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)\n\n\"I think there was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason,\" McIlroy said at the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, North Carolina, where a $20 million signature event is being played.\n\nSimpson had offered to resign, but only if McIlroy were to replace him. When a player director resigns, the other players on the board have to unanimously agree on a successor. McIlroy resigned from the board in November, and the players selected Jordan Spieth to replace him.\n\nThe seven players - Woods, Spieth, Simpson, Ogilvie, Patrick Cantlay, Adam Scott and Peter Malnati - are on the board of the PGA Tour and PGA Tour Enterprises, the commercial entity that agreed to a deal with Strategic Sports Group as a minority investor.\n\nThat deal included a $1.5 billion investment, which could be as much as $3 billion.\n\nMcIlroy was willing to return, believing he could help find a solution to the split in golf that has left some of the best players on two tours. McIlroy sees the reunification in some form as the ultimate goal and rubbed players the wrong way when he suggested earlier this year that LIV players return without punishment.\n\n\"Today's news is in no way a commentary on Rory's important perspective and influence,\" Monahan said in a statement. \"It's simple a matter of adherence to our governance process by which a tour player becomes a board member.\n\n\"Webb remaining in his position as a member of the policy board and PGA Tour Enterprises board through the end of his term provides the continuity needed at this vital time,\" he said. \"We are making progress in our negotiations with the PIF.\"\n\nMcIlroy is certain to stay involved in an unofficial capacity based on his experience of two years on the board and his voice in the game. He was the only European tour member on the PGA Tour board, and McIlroy has cultivated relationships across continents during his career.\n\nHe had said on a British soccer podcast at the start of this year that he met with the PIF governor, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, at the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai in late 2022 and that he returned home and encouraged the tour board to meet with him.\n\nThe framework agreement among the PGA Tour, European tour and PIF was announced June 6, with a deadline to finalize it by the end of 2023. Negotiations continue with little progress.\n\nWoods was among the player directors who went to the Bahamas on March 18 - Monahan and Henry also attended - to meet with Al-Rumayyan.\n\nWoods said at the Masters about that meeting, \"I don\u00b4t know if we\u00b4re closer, but certainly we\u00b4re headed in the right direction. That was a very positive meeting, and I think both sides came away from the meeting feeling positive.\"\n\nGorder is the chairman and CEO of Valero, the title sponsor of the Texas Open. He has been appointed the inaugural chairman of the PGA Tour Enterprises board.\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Ogilvie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Ogilvie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Monahan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jay Monahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Sports_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fenway Sports Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Malnati", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Malnati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_of_Louisiana", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TPC of Louisiana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Henry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John W.

So that's all fine, no hard feelings and we'll all move on.\"\n\nThe offer to rejoin the policy board came as negotiations between the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) over the shock Framework Agreement announced last June were understood to be stalling, with no expected resolution date publicly announced.\n\nMcIlroy compared the need for the deal to be finalised to that of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, which ended three decades of conflict in his home country, with the Northern Irishman left frustrated at the time it has taken to unify the men's game.\n\n\"I would say I'm impatient because I think we've got this window of opportunity to get it done,\" McIlroy explained. \"Both sides from a business perspective I wouldn't say need to get it done, but it makes sense.\n\n\"It's probably not going to feel great for either side, but if it's a place where the game of golf starts to thrive again and we can all get back together, then I think that's ultimately a really good thing.\"\n\nSimpson is now expected to serve out the remainder of his term on the policy board, with McIlroy backing the former major winner's decision to continue and hopeful a deal can still be reached.\n\n\"I'm still optimistic [on a deal being done],\" McIlroy added. \"I think Webb [Simpson] staying on is a really good thing. I think he's got a really balanced voice in all of this and I think he sees the bigger picture, which is great.\n\n\"My fear was if Webb stepped off and it wasn't me that was going in his place, what could potentially happen. Yeah, I'm really happy that Webb has made that decision to stay on and serve out the rest of his term.\n\n\"I think there's a responsibility with every generation to try to leave the PGA Tour, leave the place that you're playing in a bit of a better spot than it was before.

The inability of McIlroy to take places on the PGA Tour policy board and as a director of PGA Tour enterprises is certain to cause consternation among sponsors and partners, including the European Tour Group.\n\nWebb Simpson planned to resign from both boards, with the former US Open champion offering specific instruction that he wanted McIlroy to take on the positions. McIlroy, who has been frustrated at the time being taken to unify golf, was happy to step forward.\n\nThis, however, triggered ructions on the all-powerful PGA Tour policy board. Members include Tiger Woods, Patrick Cantlay and Jordan Spieth and there is no European representation. McIlroy has clashed previously with Cantlay and Spieth over golf's future. After delay upon delay at holding a vote over McIlroy's return - he resigned from the policy board last November, citing time constraints - Simpson will remain in place.\n\n\"It got pretty complicated and pretty messy,\" said McIlroy. \"I think it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before. There was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason.\n\n\"I think the best course of action is, if there's some people on there that aren't comfortable with me coming back on, then I think Webb just stays on and sees out his term. I think he's gotten to a place where he's comfortable with doing that and I just sort of keep doing what I'm doing.\n\n\"I put my hand up to help and it was ... I wouldn't say it was rejected, it was a complicated process to get through to put me back on there. So that's all fine, no hard feelings and we'll all move on.\n\n\"My fear was if Webb stepped off and it wasn't me that was going in his place, what could potentially happen. I'm really happy that Webb has made that decision to stay on and serve out the rest of his term.\"\n\nThose familiar with the situation have told the Guardian that lesser and alternative posts were floated for McIlroy, which he was unwilling to accept. When speaking in public, it is likely policy board members will cite governance concerns relating to Simpson effectively giving his directorships to McIlroy. However, such a point would be undermined by the processes during which Woods and Spieth were placed on the board.\n\nMcIlroy has been adamant golf requires a global schedule, as a means for traditional tours to work in tandem with the Saudi Arabian-funded LIV circuit. \"I'm impatient because I think we've got this window of opportunity to get it done,\" added the world No2. \"I sort of liken it to like when Northern Ireland went through the peace process in the '90s and the Good Friday Agreement. Neither side was happy. Catholics weren't happy, Protestants weren't happy, but it brought peace and then you just sort of learn to live with whatever has been negotiated, right?\n\n\"That was in 1998 and 25 years ahead, my generation doesn't know any different.

'if that's what people want.'\"\n\nApparently, it was not, in fact, what a few important people wanted.\n\nNegotiations between the PGA Tour and LIV's backer, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), have inched along since a framework agreement was announced in June 2023.\n\nMcIlroy, an outspoken critic of LIV, has expressed support for a unified global golf circuit -- including LIV, TGL, and DP World Tour events -- largely funded by PIF and operated by the PGA Tour.\n\n\"I think I can be helpful,\" McIlroy said in New Orleans about rejoining the board. \"I don't think there's been much progress made in the last eight months, and I was hopeful that there would be.\"\n\nHowever, before facing an official vote, the no. 2 player in the world pulled his name from consideration. Simpson will finish out his term, which runs through 2025.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the Wells Fargo Championship at Quail Hollow Club on Wednesday, McIlroy revealed that his unsuccessful effort reminded him why he stepped down in the first place.\n\n\"It got pretty complicated and pretty messy. I think with the way it happened, I think it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before. I think there was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason.\n\n\"I think the best course of action is if, there's some people on there that aren't comfortable with me coming back on, then I think Webb just stays on.\n\n\"...I put my hand up to help, and I wouldn't say it was rejected, it was a complicated process to get through to put me back on there. That's all fine. No hard feelings, we all move on.\"\n\nWoods, McIlroy, Spieth own substantial stakes of PGA Tour Enterprises, the commercial branch launched in 2024 as part of Strategic Sports Group's $3 billion investment in the PGA Tour. Tiger is vice president.\n\n\"Usually, a player doesn't have a contingency to their resignation and names a successor,\" Scott explained to GolfWeek. \"Some of the delay is just figuring out what is sensible...We have a responsibility to shareholders now. The process matters more than ever.\"\n\n\"Rory's always had really great ideas of, how do we move forward?\" Simpson said at Quail Hollow. \"I think those conversations just led to a thought of wanting him to be, not necessarily in every conversation, but in more conversations. I think the players on the board were very supportive of him being more involved in those conversations. I think they all see the vital role he plays.\"\n\n\"...We kinda had to figure out, OK where is his place? How can we honor his role as board members and also our commitment to the tour, but at least bring in a guy to at least voice his ideas and see how he can help us.\"\n\nOther player directors -- perhaps, Woods, Spieth, and Cantlay -- appear more steadfast in riding with SSG/private equity over the $700 billion sovereign wealth fund.\n\n\"SSG, we have solidified our agreement with them and with PIF, we're still negotiating,\" Tiger said in February. \"Ultimately we would like PIF be part of our tour and be a part of our product. But financially we don't [need] them now.\"\n\nIn March, Tiger organized a meeting in the Bahamas with representatives from PIF and the PGA Tour in March.\n\nAccording to one tournament director who spoke to GolfWeek, a contingency of folks support McIlroy's return specifically to counterbalance Cantlay.\n\n\"We need Rory back on the board. Had he stayed on he could've neutered Cantlay. He's the only one with the power to neuter Cantlay. We need Rory to try to keep Cantlay from ruining the Tour.\"\n\nMcIlroy, coming off his 25th career PGA Tour victory, will vie for his fifth major next week at the 2024 PGA Championship at Valhalla -- the site of his last major, 10 years ago.\n\n\"I'm impatient because we've got this window of opportunity to get it done,\" McIlroy said Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_corvo@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Michael Corvo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Scott_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adam Scott (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Malnati", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Malnati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich_Classic_of_New_Orleans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zurich Classic of New Orleans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA European Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_wealth_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign wealth fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_equity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private equity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Touring", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Touring", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiger-woods-rory-mcilroy-pga-tour.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Wednesday evening we got one, from commissioner Jay Monahan:\n\n\"Today's news is in no way a commentary on Rory's important perspective and influence. It's simply a matter of adherence to our governance process by which a Tour player becomes a Board member,\" his statement read.\n\nSo what was \"today's news?\" How'd it involve Monahan, McIlroy, Tiger Woods, Webb Simpson and Patrick Cantlay? Let's cruise through what happened.\n\n\"Today's news\" actually began several weeks ago with a report from the Guardian that Webb Simpson would be stepping aside from the PGA Tour Policy Board and Rory McIlroy would be taking his place. That was intriguing because McIlroy had resigned from the board just a few months before. Now he'd be headed back?\n\n\"I think I could be helpful to the process,\" he said at the time, lamenting the months gone by without significant progress in negotiations with the Saudi Public Investment Fund. \"But only if people want me involved, I guess.\"\n\nFor a couple of weeks. There was talk of a vote, but the vote didn't happen. So there was a report and then there was nothing. That seemed odd. It begged the question: Did relevant people in fact not want McIlroy involved?\n\nSorry for spoiling the ending here, but on Wednesday morning McIlroy spoke to assembled media following his morning pro-am at Quail Hollow in Charlotte, N.C., and broke the news: No board return for him. (You can read Sean Zak's full account here.)\n\nMcIlroy described it as \"uncomfortable\" and \"complicated\" and \"messy.\" He added that he thought the process \"opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before.\" He put his hand up to help, he said, but then things got complicated. No dice. It all sounded rather painful.\n\n\"So that's all fine, no hard feelings and we'll all move on,\" he said, seeking a hopeful conclusion.\n\nThe next man at the microphone after McIlroy was, fittingly, Simpson. He lives near Quail Hollow and is playing on a sponsor's exemption this week and he said the McIlroy maneuver came from a simple place: he just wants to help.\n\n\"So his perspective is tremendous to us,\" Simpson said. \"He's a global player, always has been, so I just think his views are important, and the other guys feel the same.\"\n\nSimpson added that McIlroy didn't want to cause \"any drama or big stories,\" but here we are. As for the idea that other board members weren't comfortable with McIlroy returning? He didn't see it that way.\n\n\"No. I think what we had to work through was, you know, where could his role best be utilized,\" Simpson said. \"There's a lot of different roles right now that different players are playing on different committees or us on the policy board or the enterprises board.\"\n\nThat raised an interesting possibility, then: Even if McIlroy's not on the policy board, could he serve on one such committee?\n\n\"Rumor mill\" probably isn't fair. There was likely some truth to it all. But various golf media establishments ran with McIlroy's comments and connected the dots to make the assumption that the policy board triumvirate of Patrick Cantlay, Jordan Spieth and Tiger Woods had been working together to block McIlroy's appointment. If true, that would be salacious; Spieth replaced McIlroy in the fall after all, and Cantlay and McIlroy have Ryder Cup and policy board beef dating back months, and Woods and McIlroy started a golf league together. It's a small, entangled world.\n\nIt's especially entangled for McIlroy, a fact that's seen as both a strength and a weakness for his board candidacy; he's close with the Fenway Sports Group, which is at the core of the PGA Tour's new investment group SSG (Strategic Sports Group) and has a relationship with Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the governor of the PIF and the chairman of LIV. Add in the fact that he's World No. 2 and a global superstar and McIlroy seems like a man who could help find common ground or a man with conflicts of interest, depending who you asked.\n\nMonahan made it clear that McIlroy's omission was \"simply a matter of adherence to our governance process.\" It was telling that he made the statement at all, and perhaps a sign that Monahan knows better than to let McIlroy twist in the wind.\n\nOthers familiar with the negotiations confirmed Monahan's account; there was a procedural flaw in the original plan. Simpson wasn't permitted to make a conditional resignation naming his successor. That doesn't mean the other factors didn't play a role, but McIlroy's appointment never reached the official voting stage.\n\n\"Webb remaining in his position as a member of the Policy Board and PGA Tour Enterprises Board through the end of his term provides the continuity needed at this vital time,\" Monahan's statement continued. \"We are making progress in our negotiations with the PIF and are working as a collective -- the Player Directors, our Boards and Tour management -- to remain open-minded to all avenues that advance the Tour in the best interest of our players, our partners and, most importantly, our fans.\"\n\nHow's this for timing? Also on Wednesday, Tiger Woods was the lone player named to the PGA Tour Enterprises' five-person \"transaction subcommittee\" that will negotiate with the Saudi PIF; he'll be joined by Monahan, policy board chairman Joe Gorder, Fenway Sports Group's John Henry and recent board appointee Joe Ogilvie.\n\nMultiple sources referenced the possibility of McIlroy joining that subcommittee in some capacity despite not being a member of the policy board. That would be a logical compromise, as it would avoid the thorniness of a McIlroy board appointment while still tapping into his perspective and connections. He has made it clear that he feels a deal between golf's warring factions is the clear best course of action and this would represent a chance to help make that happen.\n\nBut which parties want the deal to get done? And within what parameters?

Northern Irishman was mentioned a few weeks ago as the main candidate for the PGA Tour Policy Board, but it seems that won't happen, at least not in the near future.\n\nMcIlroy also admitted a few weeks ago that there's a chance he might return, believing he could be of assistance. McIlroy was previously part of the PGA Tour Policy Board but decided to resign as he felt such a role no longer suited him, stressing he needed to focus on golf more than ever.\n\nRory McIlroy spoke about his potential return to the PGA Tour Policy Board ahead of the Wells Fargo Championship. Northern Irishman confirmed that the situation is complicated, reminiscent of when he was previously part of the PGA Tour Policy Board.\n\n\"Yeah, there's been a lot of conversations. Sort of reminded me partly why I didn't. So yeah, I think it just, it got pretty complicated and pretty messy and I think with the way it happened, I think it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before.\"- Rory McIlroy said, as quoted by Golf Monthly.\n\nIn November of last year, McIlroy decided to resign from the Policy Board, focusing on his career and career challenges. Although McIlroy was one of the main ambassadors of the PGA Tour, criticizing LIV Golf, the 34-year-old golfer has changed his views, believing that LIV Golfers still have the right to return to the PGA Tour. McIlroy further discussed his potential return to the PGA Tour Policy Board, emphasizing that many individuals are against his return.\n\nMcIlroy mentioned that there seemed to be a group of people on the board who felt anxious about his return for some undisclosed reason.\n\nHe suggested that if certain members were uncomfortable with him rejoining, it might be best for Webb to continue serving on the board until his term ends. It appears that Webb has reached a point of comfort with this decision, and McIlroy intends to continue with his current activities.\n\nWebb has also proven to be a great fit for this role, but some believe that Rory is the person who deserves to be part of the PGA Tour Policy Board, considering his qualities and influence in the world of golf. McIlroy is somewhat tired of the ongoing chaos that has persisted for over two years now, hoping for an end to these conflicts between LIV Golf and the PGA Tour. McIlroy is open to the option of a merger, believing it to be the best choice for all parties involved. It's the only way to achieve harmony and peace in the golf scene.\n\nHe expressed that there's currently a chance to accomplish this, as it would be beneficial for both sides from a business standpoint, though not necessarily imperative. He acknowledged that it might not be an entirely satisfying outcome for either party, but if it leads to a revitalization of the golfing community and a return to unity, then he sees it as a positive development in the long run.\n\nNorthern Irishman believes that the focus should be on the globalization of golf, raising the question of how willing individuals are to compete outside of America.\n\n\"It could be if we go to more of a global schedule, do the American players that are used to playing all their golf in America want to travel outside of the States 12 times a year to play tournament golf, you know? That's a consideration.\"- he said.\n\nMcIlroy pointed out that if all players return to the PGA Tour, only a small number from the LIV contingent still have status or eligibility there. However, he questioned whether it would be acceptable to the rest of the membership if those players return after fulfilling their contracts and have financially benefited by potentially hundreds of millions of dollars compared to those who remained. This is an important factor to consider.\n\nThis is also one of the questions posed by many golfers, considering that things are somewhat unusual in the golf scene at the moment. Individuals who have decided to remain on the PGA Tour should perhaps receive different treatment, at least that's what most people think. Yet, it's still too early to speak about it, especially since the merger issue hasn't been resolved yet. Primarily, it's necessary for the PGA Tour and PIF to find common ground, finalize the agreement, and only then can options for the future be considered.\n\nMcIlroy expressed optimism regarding the agreement.

McIlroy himself had stepped away from the board last November but showed a desire to return.\n\nMcIlroy's return, however, was subject to a vote. It was unclear whether that vote was actually held, but the Northern Irishman admitted he was met with resistance by some on the board.\n\n\"It got pretty complicated and pretty messy and I think with the way it happened, I think it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before,\" McIlroy told reporters in Charlotte, N.C., the day before the Wells Fargo Championship begins.\n\nThe tensions come at a pivotal time in the tour's history as it continues to negotiate with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund amid a civil war with LIV Golf.\n\n\"I think there was -- there was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason,\" McIlroy said. \"I think the best course of action is if, you know, there's some people on there that aren't comfortable with me coming back on, then I think Webb just stays on and sees out his term, and I think he's gotten to a place where he's comfortable with doing that and I just sort of keep doing what I'm doing.\n\n\"So yeah, I put my hand up to help and it was -- I wouldn't say it was rejected, it was a complicated process to get through to put me back on there. So that's all fine, no hard feelings and we'll all move on.\"\n\nSimpson confirmed later Wednesday that he will see out the rest of his three-year term.\n\n\"I think the sentiment was Rory McIlroy, being the global superstar that he is and the strong voice that he has in the game of golf, you know, it would be great to get him involved more,\" Simpson said. \"So, you know, what capacity is he going to get involved more? I think three weeks ago we just wanted him more involved, and I think I've seen support from the guys on wanting him more involved and helping.\"\n\nSimpson, the 2012 U.S. Open winner, did not see pushback to McIlroy's involvement in the way McIlroy described, insisting that players want the four-time major champ to lend his assistance.\n\n\"I think what we had to work through was, you know, where could he -- where could his role best be utilized,\" Simpson said. \"There's a lot of different roles right now that different players are playing on different committees or us on the policy board or the (PGA Tour Enterprises) board. So they really were looking at it kind of holistically like yes, we want Rory to help, we know he can help and we know he's going to help. Let's all figure out a place where we feel good with saying, can you help us here, and if he feels good, then great, it's a win for all of us.\"\n\nMcIlroy said last month the lack of progress in a deal with the PIF had motivated him to jump back in the fray. He said Wednesday he remains optimistic for a deal, and that Simpson has \"got a really balanced voice in all of this and I think he sees the bigger picture.\"\n\n\"My fear was if Webb stepped off and it wasn't me that was going in his place, what could potentially happen,\" McIlroy said. \"Yeah, I'm really happy that Webb has made that decision to stay on and serve out the rest of his term.\"\n\nA report by Golfweek Tuesday painted Patrick Cantlay at odds with McIlroy. Cantlay is presently on the board and would have had a vote on McIlroy's return. An unnamed tournament director told Golfweek that Cantlay is against striking a deal with the PIF while McIlroy is all for reunification.\n\n\"We need Rory back on the board. Had he stayed on he could've neutered Cantlay. He's the only one with the power to neuter Cantlay. We need Rory to try to keep Cantlay from ruining the tour,\" the tournament director said. \"Webb is too nice.\"\n\nGolfweek also quoted former player directors Kevin Streelman and James Hahn as being against the idea of McIlroy being hand-picked to return.\n\n\"He was very clear that it was too much for him,\" Streelman said. \"He had business dealings, he has a kid, he wants to focus on his game. Trust me, I get it. But once you quit, you're not getting back. ... I wouldn't quit on something that you were elected to by your peers. To want back in is peculiar.\"\n\nMcIlroy was asked Wednesday if he can still affect change in the tour from the outside.\n\n\"I sort of liken it to like when Northern Ireland went through the peace process in the '90s and the Good Friday Agreement, neither side was happy,\" McIlroy said. \"Catholics weren't happy, Protestants weren't happy, but it brought peace and then you just sort of learn to live with whatever has been negotiated, right? ...\n\n\"That's sort of how I -- it's my little I guess way of trying to think about it and trying to make both sides see that there could be a compromise here. Yeah, it's probably not going to feel great for either side, but if it's a place where the game of golf starts to thrive again and we can all get back together, then I think that's ultimately a really good thing.\"", "source": {"uri": "fresnobee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Fresno Bee"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@fresnobee.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golfweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golfweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hahn_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Hahn (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Streelman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Streelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Friday Agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protestantism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Computer_Aides", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Computer Aides", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://www.fresnobee.com/wps/build/images/fresnobee/facebook.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Henry of Fenway Sports Group and Joe Ogilvie, a former tour player appointed as a director liaison in March.\n\nThe subcommittee reports back to the full board.\n\nThe developments capped a day that began with Rory McIlroy losing the inside track on rejoining the board as Webb Simpson's replacement when board members resisted his return.\n\n\"I think there was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason,\" McIlroy said at the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, North Carolina, where a $20 million signature event is being played.\n\nSimpson had offered to resign, but only if McIlroy were to replace him. When a player director resigns, the other players on the board have to unanimously agree on a successor. McIlroy resigned from the board in November, and the players selected Jordan Spieth to replace him.\n\nThe seven players -- Woods, Spieth, Simpson, Ogilvie, Patrick Cantlay, Adam Scott and Peter Malnati -- are on the board of the PGA Tour and PGA Tour Enterprises, the commercial entity that agreed to a deal with Strategic Sports Group as a minority investor.\n\nThat deal included a $1.5 billion investment, which could be as much as $3 billion.\n\nMcIlroy was willing to return, believing he could help find a solution to the split in golf that has left some of the best players on two tours. McIlroy sees the reunification in some form as the ultimate goal and rubbed players the wrong way when he suggested earlier this year that LIV players return without punishment.\n\n\"Today's news is in no way a commentary on Rory's important perspective and influence,\" Monahan said in a statement. \"It's simple a matter of adherence to our governance process by which a tour player becomes a board member.\n\n\"Webb remaining in his position as a member of the policy board and PGA Tour Enterprises board through the end of his term provides the continuity needed at this vital time,\" he said. \"We are making progress in our negotiations with the PIF.\"\n\nMcIlroy is certain to stay involved in an unofficial capacity based on his experience of two years on the board and his voice in the game. He was the only European tour member on the PGA Tour board, and McIlroy has cultivated relationships across continents during his career.\n\nHe had said on a British soccer podcast at the start of this year that he met with the PIF governor, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, at the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai in late 2022 and that he returned home and encouraged the tour board to meet with him.\n\nThe framework agreement among the PGA Tour, European tour and PIF was announced June 6, with a deadline to finalize it by the end of 2023. Negotiations continue with little progress.\n\nWoods was among the player directors who went to the Bahamas on March 18 -- Monahan and Henry also attended -- to meet with Al-Rumayyan.\n\nWoods said at the Masters about that meeting, \"I don't know if we're closer, but certainly we're headed in the right direction.

McIlroy also believes golf's current divide is unsustainable. Hence, the Northern Irishman felt his return would not only be welcomed but also help professional golf as a whole.\n\nCurrent board members did not feel the same.\n\n\"It got pretty complicated and pretty messy, and I think with the way it happened, I think it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before,\" McIlroy said Wednesday.\n\n\"There was a subset of people on the board who were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason. Yeah, I think that the best course of action is if, you know, there are some people on there who aren't comfortable with me coming back on, then...

But considering Woods and McIlroy will launch TGL together in 2025, the 15-time major winner's dissent certainly raises some eyebrows.\n\nIn fact, Beall reports that the Woods and McIlroy relationship \"has soured\" over the past six months. Each player has a differing view of how professional golf should proceed into the future, with McIlroy championing the need for a world golf tour. He laid out this dream scenario in Dubai in January.\n\nWoods, meanwhile, has not publically laid out his visions for the future of the PGA Tour. Yet, at the Genesis Invitational in February, Woods said that the key stakeholders are assessing numerous options.\n\n\"We're looking into all the different models for pathways back [for LIV Golf players],\" Woods said in February.\n\n\"What that looks like, what the impact is for the players who have stayed and who have not left, and how we make our product better going forward, there is no answer to that right now. We're looking at varying degrees of ideas and what that looks like in the short term, we don't know. We don't even know in the longer term what that looks like. Trust me, there are daily and weekly emails and talks about this and what this looks like for our tour going forward.\"\n\nOn the flip side, McIlroy, who has previously said that he \"hates\" LIV Golf, has reversed course in recent months to resolve the divide. He wants all the same golfers playing alongside one another and would welcome back those who joined LIV Golf.\n\nPerhaps that is where the difference in opinion between Woods and McIlroy lies.\n\nNevertheless, tensions between PGA Tour brass remain rocky, indicating that negotiations between the tour and the PIF remain far apart. Until the leading players of the PGA Tour can get on the same page, men's professional golf will remain divided.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_milko@sbnation.com", "name": "Jack Milko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T_Pebble_Beach_Pro-Am", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Players_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Players Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_Digest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf Digest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0vlaa8kRDMQPfo4BqDinek8nOHI=/0x247:3000x1747/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25440069/1479464957.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, Webb Simpson will continue serving on the decision-making panel.\n\nAddressing the PGA Wells Fargo Championship's eve at Quail Hollow in Charlotte, North Carolina, McIlroy mentioned that certain board members expressed reservations regarding his comeback following his resignation from the board last year.\n\n\"There's been a lot of conversations. Sort of reminded me partly why I didn't (stay),\" McIlroy said. \"It got pretty complicated and pretty messy and I think with the way it happened, it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before.\n\n\"There was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason. I think the best course of action is, Webb just stays on and sees out his term, and I think he has gotten to a place where he's comfortable with doing that and I just sort of keep doing what I'm doing.\"\n\nAmong its members are golfers Tiger Woods, Adam Scott, Jordan Spieth, Patrick Cantlay, and Peter Malnati. Both Cantlay and Spieth have previously clashed with McIlroy regarding the future trajectory of golf. There was an anticipation for McIlroy's return following the announcement from 2012 US Open winner Simpson, who stated his intention to step down in order to prioritise spending more time with his family.\n\nContrarily, as per McIlroy's statement, Simpson will fulfill his term, which is scheduled to conclude in 2025. \"I put my hand up to help and it was, I wouldn't say it was rejected,\" McIlroy said. \"It was a complicated process to get through to put me back on there. So that's all fine, no hard feelings and we'll all move on.\"\n\nDiscussions continue within the board regarding the completion of a merger agreement between the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), supporters of the competing LIV Golf League, following the announcement of a framework agreement last June.\n\n\"I'm still optimistic,\" McIlroy said. \"I think Webb staying on is a really good thing. He has got a really balanced voice in all of this and I think he sees the bigger picture, which is great. My fear was if Webb stepped off and it wasn't me that was going in his place, what could potentially happen.\"\n\nConversations that initially had a December deadline have stretched out for months, with the frustrations stemming from slow or nonexistent progress being one of the factors contributing to McIlroy's departure. \"I'm impatient because I think we've got this window of opportunity to get it done, because both sides from a business perspective I wouldn't say need to get it done, but it makes sense,\" McIlroy said.\n\nThe golf star drew parallels between the current situation and the Good Friday Agreement, which brought an end to the conflict in Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\n\"Catholics weren't happy, Protestants weren't happy, but it brought peace and then you just sort of learn to live with whatever has been negotiated,\" McIlroy added. That's my little way of trying to think about it and trying to make both sides see that there could be a compromise here.

Yeah, I think the best course of action is if there are some people on there who aren't comfortable with me coming back on, then I think Webb [Simpson] just stays on and sees out his term, and I think he's gotten to a place where he's comfortable with doing that, and I just sort of keep doing what I'm doing.\"\n\nMcIlroy did not mention anyone by name, but the subset of people on the board most likely is in reference to Patrick Cantlay.

So that's all fine, no hard feelings, and we'll all move on.\"\n\nMcIlroy wanted to return to the board to help speed up negotiations between the PGA Tour and the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF), LIV Golf's beneficiary. The PIF and the tour struck a framework agreement in June 2023 and set a deadline for Dec. 31, 2023, to strike a formal deal. All involved hoped that would resolve golf's great schism.\n\nBut a deal remains far apart, and men's professional golf remains divided, leaving McIlroy unsatisfied.\n\n\"I'm impatient because I think we've got this window of opportunity to get it done,\" McIlroy added.\n\n\"I liken it to when Northern Ireland went through the peace process in the '90s and the Good Friday Agreement; neither side was happy.

He also envisions the tour creating more opportunities like it has with the Genesis Scottish Open. This co-sanctioned event brings the top players from the PGA and DP World Tours to Scotland the week before The Open Championship.\n\nPerhaps the same can be done with the Irish Open, French Open, Italian Open, Australian Open, or other events around the world.\n\nBut McIlroy alluded to other members of the board taking issue with this idea.\n\n\"It could be if we go to more of a global schedule, do the American players that are used to playing all their golf in America want to travel outside of the States 12 times a year to play tournament golf, you know? That's a consideration,\" McIlroy said.\n\nI just feel like it's my obligation or duty to give back and help set the next generation of players up... I think there's a responsibility with every generation to try to leave the Tour, leave the place that you're playing in a bit of a better spot than it was before.

So that's all fine, no hard feelings and we'll all move on.\"\n\nMcIlroy has long been one of the most vocal critics of LIV Golf, insisting in July last year that he would rather retire than play on the Saudi-funded breakaway, but has softened his stance on the influx of money from the sovereign state's PIF and admits he is \"impatient\" to get a deal done.\n\n\"I think we've got this window of opportunity to get it done, because both sides from a business perspective I wouldn't say need to get it done, but it makes sense,\" McIlroy said\n\n\"I sort of liken it to like when Northern Ireland went through the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement, neither side was happy.

I think he's got a really balanced voice in all of this and I think he sees the bigger picture, which is great.\n\n\"My fear was if Webb stepped off and it wasn't me that was going in his place, what could potentially happen.

And I think there was a subset of people on the board who were uncomfortable with me coming back on.\"\n\nJordan Spieth replaced McIlroy on the PGA Tour Policy Board after his resignation. Spieth and McIlroy had a difference in opinion as McIlroy did not agree with Spieth's take on the merger agreement between the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF).\n\nSpieth felt there was no need to have a deal with the PIF as he believed the $1.5 billion cash injection given to the PGA Tour by Strategic Sports Group was sufficient.\n\nFans online reacted to this latest development and speculated Spieth's influence on McIlroy's decision to not rejoin the Policy Board. A fan wrote on X (formerly Twitter):\n\n\"Jordan Spieth is ring leader.\"\n\nRumors of an alleged deal offered to Rory McIlroy from LIV Golf emerged after the 2024 Masters at Augusta National. A user wrote:\n\n\"Rory needs to take the 400 million and jump to LIV.

Hope this all gets worked out quickly,\" a fan wrote.\n\n\"Code for: @livgolf_league here I come. Prepare the \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0's.\" another fan speculated.\n\nWhy was Rory McIlroy going to return to the PGA Tour Policy Board?\n\nNegotiations between LIV Golf's primary investor, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, and the PGA Tour have been underway for almost a year now. The PIF reportedly requested that Rory McIlroy be on the Tour's Policy Board for the negotiations.\n\nIf McIlroy were to return to the Policy Board, Webb Simpson would have to step down. Several PGA Tour players were reportedly displeased with the news.\n\nWhen previously asked if he would be returning to the board at a press conference during the 2024 Zurich Classic of New Orleans, McIlroy said:\n\n\"I think I can be helpful. I don't think there's been much progress made in the last eight months and I was hopeful that there would be. I think I could be helpful to the process.

I think the best course of action is, if there [are] some people on there who aren't comfortable with coming back on, then I think Webb stays on and sees out his term.\n\n\"I wouldn't say it was rejected,\" he added. \"It was a complicated process to get through to put me back on there. So that's all fine, no hard feelings and we'll all move on.\"\n\nMcIlroy: Golf can learn from the Good Friday Agreement\n\nAs reconciliation talks between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf continue to drag on further past the initial December 31 deadline, the schism between the warring tours continues to overshadow the men's game.\n\nParticipation of LIV Golf players - unable to earn ranking points from events on the circuit - at the major championships continues to be a recurring point of contention, with seven players from the Saudi-backed league receiving special invites to play the PGA Championship next week.\n\nMcIlroy, who admitted in January that he had been \"too judgmental\" of the first players to switch from the PGA Tour to LIV Golf, said both sides would need to be willing to compromise to bring the long-running feud to an end.\n\nAs an example, the 35-year-old referenced the Good Friday Agreement, a peace deal struck in 1998 that brought an end to decades of sectarian violence - \"the Troubles\" - in his homeland.\n\n\"Neither side was happy,\" McIlroy recalled. \"Catholics weren't happy, Protestants weren't happy, but it brought peace and then you just sort of learn to live with whatever has been negotiated.\n\n\"[Today], my generation doesn't know any different - it's just this is what it's always been like and we've never known anything but peace.\n\n\"It's probably not going to feel great for either side,\" he added. \"But if it's a place where the game of golf starts to thrive again and we can all get back together, then I think that's ultimately a really good thing.\"\n\nMcIlroy is chasing a fourth win at Quail Hollow Club and arrives in fine form after teaming up with fellow Irishman Shane Lowry to win the Zurich Classic of New Orleans last month.\n\n\"I've had a pretty slow start to the season, especially over here in the States,\" he said.\n\n\"I felt like I needed something like that to get me going and, hopefully, that's the case.\"\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_bantock@aol.com", "name": "Jack Bantock", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Good Friday Agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Troubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich_Classic_of_New_Orleans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zurich Classic of New Orleans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sectarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protestantism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_cnn_sports_articles_606/9552180334afaa00e31aa9d6aa5e7836", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-31", "textStart": 1696, "textEnd": 1707}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Yet after first seeing the board securing more than \u00a31billion of private US investment at the same time as witnessing barely any progress made in the PIF negotiations, McIlroy declared that, as he would \"rather the men's golf professional landscape survived this, so I'm happy to do my bit.\"\n\nThe Northern Irishman had long been one of the most vocal critics of LIV Golf, insisting in July last year that he would rather retire than play on the Saudi-funded breakaway, but has softened his stance on PIF in the last year. He recently admitted he is \"impatient\" to get a deal done and compared it to the difficulty of negotiations in the Northern Ireland peace deal in the 1990s.\n\n\"I think we've got this window of opportunity to get it done because both sides from a business perspective, I wouldn't say need to get it done, but it makes sense,\" McIlroy said.\n\n\"I sort of liken it to when Northern Ireland went through the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement, neither side was happy. Catholics weren't happy, Protestants weren't happy, but it brought peace and then you just sort of learn to live with whatever has been negotiated, right?\n\n\"That was in 1998 and 20, 25, 30 years ahead, my generation doesn't know any different. It's just this is what it's always been like and we've never known anything but peace. It's my little way of trying to think about it and trying to make both sides see that there could be a compromise here.\n\n\"Yeah, it's probably not going to feel great for either side, but if it's a place where the game of golf starts to thrive again and we can all get back together, then I think that's ultimately a really good thing.\"\n\nMcIlroy did not name any individuals who resisted him rejoining the policy board and insisted that \"there are no hard feelings\". He also emphasised it would have been \"complicated\" for him simply to be a direct substitute for Simpson. But there can be little doubt that this snub is indicative of the struggle going on in the background and once again Cantlay is the focus.\n\nGolfweek, the influential American magazine and website, went as far on Wednesday to name Cantlay as the ringleader for those against a PIF merger and back in December, Telegraph Sport quoted an unnamed high-ranking official who blamed the world No 8 for the players' revolt against the Tour executives that ultimately led to Saudi anger and Jon Rahm's \u00a3400 million defection.\n\nMcIlroy has made no secret of his strained relationship with Cantlay, saying \"we see the world quite differently\" and recently had an exchange of views with Spieth, another policy board member, after the American suggested the Tour's multi-billion dollar deal with Strategic Sports Group meant investment from the PIF might not be needed.\n\nSimpson will remain in position until his term finishes in 18 months. Both Cantlay and McIlroy are playing this week in Charlotte at the Wells Fargo Championship.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Good Friday Agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_golfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional golfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protestantism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Rahm", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Rahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golfweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golfweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company_Loyalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company Loyalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DNPFKMGygnQKJbVgRs5N2w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_258/f96ac0194905bfb8f8728143163244ef", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

The Holywood player wants to see the creation of some kind of world tour with at least 12 events outside the US but admits a compromise might be tough for both sides to swallow.\n\n\"Yeah, there's been a lot of conversations,\" McIlroy said at Quail Hollow. \"Sort of reminded me partly why I didn't.\n\n\"So yeah, I think it just, it got pretty complicated and pretty messy and I think with the way it happened, I think it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before.\n\n\"I think there was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason.\n\n\"I think the best course of action is if, you know, there's some people on there that aren't comfortable with me coming back on, then I think Webb just stays on and sees out his term, and I think he's gotten to a place where he's comfortable with doing that and I just sort of keep doing what I'm doing.\n\n\"I put my hand up to help and it was -- I wouldn't say it was rejected, it was a complicated process to get through to put me back on there. So that's all fine, no hard feelings and we'll all move on.\"\n\nThe Co Down man compared the difficulty of the negotiations between the PGA Tour and the PIF to the Northern Ireland peace process of the 1990s.\n\n\"I sort of liken it to like when Northern Ireland went through the peace process in the '90s and the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said.\n\n\"Neither side was happy.

That's a consideration,\" he said.\n\nAs for his reasons for wanting to see an agreement, McIlroy pointed to the long term health of the men's professional game, which has been fractured for more than two years following the emergence of LIV Golf.\n\n\"I would say that golf and the PGA Tour has been so good to me over the years, I just feel like it's my obligation or duty to try to give back and try to set the next generation of players up like we were set up by the previous generation,\" he said.\n\n\"So Jack, Arnie, the guys that really helped build the PGA Tour and helped it thrive, and Tiger obviously, to get it to where it is today, I think there's a responsibility with every generation to try to leave the Tour, leave the place that you're playing in a bit of a better spot than it was before.

Henry of Fenway Sports Group and Joe Ogilvie, a former tour player appointed as a director liaison in March.\n\nThe subcommittee reports back to the full board.\n\nThe developments capped a day that began with Rory McIlroy losing the inside track on rejoining the board as Webb Simpson's replacement when board members resisted his return.\n\n\"I think there was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason,\" McIlroy said at the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, North Carolina, where a $20 million signature event is being played.\n\nSimpson had offered to resign, but only if McIlroy were to replace him. When a player director resigns, the other players on the board have to unanimously agree on a successor. McIlroy resigned from the board in November, and the players selected Jordan Spieth to replace him.\n\nThe seven players -- Woods, Spieth, Simpson, Ogilvie, Patrick Cantlay, Adam Scott and Peter Malnati -- are on the board of the PGA Tour and PGA Tour Enterprises, the commercial entity that agreed to a deal with Strategic Sports Group as a minority investor.\n\nThat deal included a $1.5 billion investment, which could be as much as $3 billion.\n\nMcIlroy was willing to return, believing he could help find a solution to the split in golf that has left some of the best players on two tours. McIlroy sees the reunification in some form as the ultimate goal and rubbed players the wrong way when he suggested earlier this year that LIV players return without punishment.\n\n\"Today's news is in no way a commentary on Rory's important perspective and influence,\" Monahan said in a statement. \"It's simple a matter of adherence to our governance process by which a tour player becomes a board member.\n\n\"Webb remaining in his position as a member of the policy board and PGA Tour Enterprises board through the end of his term provides the continuity needed at this vital time,\" he said. \"We are making progress in our negotiations with the PIF.\" McIlroy is certain to stay involved in an unofficial capacity based on his experience of two years on the board and his voice in the game. He was the only European tour member on the PGA Tour board, and McIlroy has cultivated relationships across continents during his career.\n\nHe had said on a British soccer podcast at the start of this year that he met with the PIF governor, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, at the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai in late 2022 and that he returned home and encouraged the tour board to meet with him.\n\nThe framework agreement among the PGA Tour, European tour and PIF was announced June 6, with a deadline to finalize it by the end of 2023. Negotiations continue with little progress.\n\nWoods was among the player directors who went to the Bahamas on March 18 -- Monahan and Henry also attended -- to meet with Al-Rumayyan.\n\nWoods said at the Masters about that meeting, \"I don't know if we're closer, but certainly we're headed in the right direction. That was a very positive meeting, and I think both sides came away from the meeting feeling positive.\"\n\nGorder is the chairman and CEO of Valero, the title sponsor of the Texas Open.

Given that he is the most influential player in golf not named Tiger Woods, it appeared McIlroy's return to the board would be a smooth process.\n\nWoods, and other players on the board, said not so fast.\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, five players, minus Simpson, held the power to bring McIlroy back onto the board. Still, Patrick Cantlay, Woods, and another unnamed player director voted 3-2 against the re-inclusion of McIlroy. The third vote had to come from one of Jordan Spieth, Adam Scott, or Peter Malnati as they round out the six players currently only on the board.\n\nMcIlroy did not name any individuals who were \"uncomfortable\" with him potentially rejoining the board, but did insist that there were \"no hard feelings\" after he was voted down.\n\nPlenty of signs pointed to Cantlay being a player against McIlroy returning to the board. McIlroy, Cantlay, and the American's caddie, Joe LaCava, had a serious back-and-forth that spilled into the parking lot at the 2023 Ryder Cup. On top of that, McIlroy called Cantlay a \"di-k\" weeks after the drama during Team Europe's victory.\n\n\"Joe LaCava used to be a nice guy when he was caddying for Tiger, and now he's caddying for that d-ck he's turned into a ... I still wasn't in a great headspace,\" McIlroy explained in December.\n\nWoods not liking the idea of McIlroy returning to the policy board is a bit more of a surprise, but it may have to do with their differing viewpoints about the framework agreement between the Saudi PIF, the sole funder of LIV Golf, and the PGA Tour.\n\nAfter being the most vocal LIV critic for the better part of a year, McIlroy is now of the opinion that the Tour needs to find a way to work with the Saudis, even after the PGA Tour struck a $3 billion investment deal with an American group. After the Tour received its influx of cash from American investors, Woods stated, \"Financially, we don't [need that] that right now\" when asked about Saudi PIF investing in the Tour.\n\nNot long after his quote, however, Woods was among the group of players to meet with Saudi PIF representatives in the Bahamas earlier this year and said the talks were \"positive.\"", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_harris@outkick.com", "name": "Mark Harris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Malnati", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Malnati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Scott_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Scott (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1479414974.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

The merger between the PGA Tour and PIF, announced back in June 2023, has yet to be finalized despite continuous postponements.\n\nEarlier this year, PGA Tour Players Directors and PIF met to discuss the potential merger, and talks have continued since then. According to a recent report by the Associated Press, Tiger Woods will join PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan, board chairman Joe Gorder, John W. Henry, and Joe Oglivie to further advance the deal.\n\nIt is important to note that there are six PGA Tour player directors, including Tiger Woods, Jordan Spieth, Patrick Cantlay, Webb Simpson, Adam Scott, and Peter Malnati. Initially, Rory McIlroy was also part of this group, but he resigned from his position.\n\nA week ago, reports indicated that McIlroy might rejoin the PGA Tour Policy Board, especially as Simpson was resigning. However, the latest update suggests that Rory McIlroy will not rejoin the PGA Tour Policy Board due to alleged opposition from other player directors.\n\nTiger Woods snubs Rory McIlroy's return to the PGA Tour Policy Board Players Directors\n\nAccording to a report by Golf Digest, Jordan Spieth, Tiger Woods, and Patrick Cantlay were not in favor of Rory McIlroy's return to the PGA Tour Policy Board Players Directors position.\n\nWoods shares a strong relationship with the current World No. 2 golfer. Moreover, they collaborated professionally to start the TGL Golf League. However, their relationship has been falling apart in the last six months, as claimed by the aforementioned source.\n\nMcIlroy was a strong supporter of the PGA Tour during its civil war with LIV Golf. However, last year, when the Tour announced the merger, McIlroy shocked the golf world with his thoughts about the breakaway series. His heart softened towards LIV Golf, which is financially backed by PIF, and he ultimately resigned from the Players Director position.\n\nRory McIlroy opened up about the PGA Tour's decision on his return in a pre-tournament press conference of the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship. He said (via Mirror.com):\n\n\"I think it got pretty complicated and pretty messy, and I think with the way it happened, I think it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before. There was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason.\"\n\nAmid all this, Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods are set to compete at the PGA Championship next week.

Henry of Fenway Sports Group and Joe Ogilvie, a former tour player appointed as a director liaison in March.\n\nThe subcommittee reports back to the full board.\n\nThe developments capped a day that began with Rory McIlroy losing the inside track on rejoining the board as Webb Simpson's replacement when board members resisted his return.\n\n\"I think there was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason,\" McIlroy said at the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, North Carolina, where a $20 million signature event is being played.\n\nSimpson had offered to resign, but only if McIlroy were to replace him. When a player director resigns, the other players on the board have to unanimously agree on a successor. McIlroy resigned from the board in November, and the players selected Jordan Spieth to replace him.\n\nThe seven players -- Woods, Spieth, Simpson, Ogilvie, Patrick Cantlay, Adam Scott and Peter Malnati -- are on the board of the PGA Tour and PGA Tour Enterprises, the commercial entity that agreed to a deal with Strategic Sports Group as a minority investor.\n\nThat deal included a $1.5 billion investment, which could be as much as $3 billion.\n\nMcIlroy was willing to return, believing he could help find a solution to the split in golf that has left some of the best players on two tours. McIlroy sees the reunification in some form as the ultimate goal and rubbed players the wrong way when he suggested earlier this year that LIV players return without punishment.\n\n\"Today's news is in no way a commentary on Rory's important perspective and influence,\" Monahan said in a statement. \"It's simple a matter of adherence to our governance process by which a tour player becomes a board member.\n\n\"Webb remaining in his position as a member of the policy board and PGA Tour Enterprises board through the end of his term provides the continuity needed at this vital time,\" he said. \"We are making progress in our negotiations with the PIF.\"\n\nMcIlroy is certain to stay involved in an unofficial capacity based on his experience of two years on the board and his voice in the game. He was the only European tour member on the PGA Tour board, and McIlroy has cultivated relationships across continents during his career.\n\nHe had said on a British soccer podcast at the start of this year that he met with the PIF governor, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, at the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai in late 2022 and that he returned home and encouraged the tour board to meet with him.\n\nThe framework agreement among the PGA Tour, European tour and PIF was announced June 6, with a deadline to finalize it by the end of 2023. Negotiations continue with little progress.\n\nWoods was among the player directors who went to the Bahamas on March 18 -- Monahan and Henry also attended -- to meet with Al-Rumayyan.\n\nWoods said at the Masters about that meeting, \"I don't know if we're closer, but certainly we're headed in the right direction.

Andrew Redington/Getty Images\n\nMcIlroy: Golf can learn from the Good Friday Agreement\n\nAs reconciliation talks between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf continue to drag on further past the initial December 31 deadline, the schism between the warring tours continues to overshadow the men's game.\n\nParticipation of LIV Golf players - unable to earn ranking points from events on the circuit - at the major championships continues to be a recurring point of contention, with seven players from the Saudi-backed league receiving special invites to play the PGA Championship next week.\n\nMcIlroy, who admitted in January that he had been \"too judgmental\" of the first players to switch from the PGA Tour to LIV Golf, said both sides would need to be willing to compromise to bring the long-running feud to an end.\n\nAs an example, the 35-year-old referenced the Good Friday Agreement, a peace deal struck in 1998 that brought an end to decades of sectarian violence - \"the Troubles\" - in his homeland.\n\n\"Neither side was happy,\" McIlroy recalled. \"Catholics weren't happy, Protestants weren't happy, but it brought peace and then you just sort of learn to live with whatever has been negotiated.\n\n\"[Today], my generation doesn't know any different - it's just this is what it's always been like and we've never known anything but peace.\n\n\"It's probably not going to feel great for either side,\" he added. \"But if it's a place where the game of golf starts to thrive again and we can all get back together, then I think that's ultimately a really good thing.\"\n\nMcIlroy is chasing a fourth win at Quail Hollow Club and arrives in fine form after teaming up with fellow Irishman Shane Lowry to win the Zurich Classic of New Orleans last month.\n\n\"I've had a pretty slow start to the season, especially over here in the States,\" he said.\n\n\"I felt like I needed something like that to get me going and, hopefully, that's the case.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_bantock@cnn.com", "name": "Jack Bantock", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts":

Rory McIlroy returning to PGA Tour policy board\n\nRelated:\n\nShould the Woods-McIlroy relationship have indeed 'soured', per Golf Digest's latest report, then it could certainly make their new TGL a tad awkward when it all starts up in early 2025.\n\nIt was supposed to commence this January but a start date was pushed back 12 months after the stadium roof caved in.\n\nMcIlroy and Woods are the brainchilds behind the tech-infused golf league, which will see a number of the world's best players on the PGA Tour come together in six team rosters for some indoor, weeknight golf.\n\nEarlier today, McIlroy confirmed that despite putting up his hand to return to the PGA Tour policy board this month, he was unsuccessful.\n\nHe had wanted a quick return to try and help get the PGA Tour, PIF merger over the line and bring some form of unification back into the professional game.\n\nOne tournament director went as far to say McIlroy was being urged back to the policy board by a number of people because current lead voice Cantlay was 'ruining' the PGA Tour.\n\nMcIlroy today claimed a 'subset of people on the board were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason'.\n\nWhile McIlroy did not reveal any names, Woods was indeed a big reason why the World No.2 has not returned to the policy board.\n\nTelegraph Sport understands that five player directors on the PGA Tour - other than Simpson - had the power to decide on McIlroy's reinclusion but they voted against him.\n\n\"Tiger Woods, along with the supposed ringleader Patrick Cantlay who is against Saudi investment, formed the resistance and won the day 3-2,\" per Telegraph Sport.\n\nThe third player to vote against McIlroy was reportedly Spieth.\n\n\"The McIlroy-Woods relationship, sources tell Golf Digest, has also soured over the past six months. It remains cordial, yet their different views on the future of professional golf has led to a falling out of sorts.\"\n\nIt has also been widely reported that McIlroy has not seen eye-to-eye with Cantlay.\n\nThat was even before his clash with Cantlay's current caddie and Woods' former bagman LaCava at the 2023 Ryder Cup at Marco Simone.\n\nMcIlroy recently labelled Cantlay a 'd***'.\n\nGolf Digest also claims McIlroy's relationship with Spieth has somewhat faded too.\n\nMcIlroy reportedly removed himself from a PGA Tour group chat in February straight after hearing Spieth's comments about a PIF deal no longer being needed on the circuit as a result of SSG's heavy $3 billion investment deal.\n\n\"As for Spieth and McIlroy, McIlroy removed himself from a player text chain following Spieth's comments at Pebble Beach (where Spieth said the tour doesn't need PIF after the deal with SSG), leading to an hour-long chat between the two.\"\n\nSpieth and McIlroy were also seen clashing over a drop in the first round of The Players Championship a month later.\n\nPGA Tour pro and former player director on the board Kevin Streelman told Golfweek:\n\n\"Rory was very clear that it was too much for him. He had business dealings, he has a kid, he wants to focus on his game. Trust me, I get it. But once you quit, you're not getting back. I wouldn't quit on something that you were elected to by your peers. To want back in is peculiar.\"\n\nMcIlroy starts a warm 7/1 tournament favourite as he goes in search of a fourth victory at the Wells Fargo Championship this week.\n\nHe is already the tournament record holder at Quail Hollow having landed three wins in 2010, 2015 and 2021.\n\nThis week's tournament marks the sixth of eight signature events on the PGA Tour.\n\nWorld No.1 Scottie Scheffler is also on the sidelines as he waits for his wife Meredith to give birth to their first child.\n\nWhat do you make of reports claiming McIlroy and Woods' relationship has 'soured over the past six months'?

Amid major debate among golf's leading lights over the sport's trajectory, the PIF-backed tour agreed to a stunning potential merger with the PGA Tour and DP World Tour last summer.\n\nHowever, talks over a \"framework agreement\" to bring this deal to fruition have proven slow, with progress having stalled in the interim period. With this impasse ongoing, Webb Simpson offered to resign from the PGA Tour policy board last month - with McIlroy throwing his hat into the ring to replace him.\n\nThe Northern Irishman's offer to help with negotiations came after he served on the Player Advisory Council in 2019, while also sitting on the PGA Tour policy board between 2021 and last November. However, the 35-year-old's offer appeared to divide opinion within the policy board's inner sanctum and was eventually passed over.\n\nREAD MORE: Rory McIlroy left PGA Tour players' text chain after Jordan Spieth's LIV Golf remarks\n\nREAD MORE: LIV Golf stars earn PGA Championship invite as Talor Gooch and Patrick Reed handed major lifeline\n\nStars including the aforementioned Woods, Patrick Cantlay and Jordan Spieth sit on the policy board, with the four-time majors winner McIlroy having clashed with the latter pair over the sport's future before today. Moreover, Kevin Streelman and James Hahn raised various concerns over the star making a return in this capacity, as per Golf Week.\n\nIn the case of Streelman, he posited: \"He was very clear that it was too much for him. He had business dealings, he has a kid, he wants to focus on his game. Trust me, I get it. But once you quit, you're not getting back, I wouldn't quit on something that you were elected to by your peers. To want back in is peculiar.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Hahn also seemed to be left concerned by the aspect of Simpson essentially hand-picking who should succeed him on the policy board. He asserted: \"That's just not how democracy works. It goes against all the principles of what makes a Tour-run organization.\"\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nRory McIlroy had offered to return to the PGA Tour policy board as Webb Simpson offered his resignation\n\nGiving his own recollections about the fallout from his offer and the subsequent rejection, McIlroy admitted that the process had been tense. He confessed: \"It got pretty complicated and pretty messy. I think it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before.\n\n\"There was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason. I think the best course of action is, if there's some people on there that aren't comfortable with me coming back on, then I think Webb just stays on and sees out his term.\n\n\"I think he's gotten to a place where he's comfortable with doing that and I just sort of keep doing what I'm doing. I put my hand up to help and it was ... I wouldn't say it was rejected, it was a complicated process to get through to put me back on there.

How To Watch PAK vs IRE T20I Matches Live Streaming Online?.\n\nThe tour said Woods will be part of the \"transaction subcommittee\" on the board of PGA Tour Enterprises that will handle day-to-day negotiations as PIF seeks to become a minority investor.\n\nAlso on the subcommittee are PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan, board chairman Joe Gorder, John W. Henry of Fenway Sports Group and Joe Ogilvie, a former tour player appointed as a director liaison in March.\n\nAlso Read | LSG Owner Sanjiv Goenka Caught on Camera Having Intense Conversation With KL Rahul Following 10-Wicket Defeat Against SunRisers Hyderabad in IPL 2024 (Watch Video).\n\nThe subcommittee reports back to the full board.\n\nThe developments capped a day that began with Rory McIlroy losing the inside track on rejoining the board as Webb Simpson's replacement when board members resisted his return.\n\n\"I think there was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason,\" McIlroy said at the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, North Carolina, where a $20 million signature event is being played.\n\nSimpson had offered to resign, but only if McIlroy were to replace him. When a player director resigns, the other players on the board have to unanimously agree on a successor. McIlroy resigned from the board in November, and the players selected Jordan Spieth to replace him.\n\nThe seven players -- Woods, Spieth, Simpson, Ogilvie, Patrick Cantlay, Adam Scott and Peter Malnati -- are on the board of the PGA Tour and PGA Tour Enterprises, the commercial entity that agreed to a deal with Strategic Sports Group as a minority investor.\n\nThat deal included a $1.5 billion investment, which could be as much as $3 billion.\n\nMcIlroy was willing to return, believing he could help find a solution to the split in golf that has left some of the best players on two tours. McIlroy sees the reunification in some form as the ultimate goal and rubbed players the wrong way when he suggested earlier this year that LIV players return without punishment.\n\n\"Today's news is in no way a commentary on Rory's important perspective and influence,\" Monahan said in a statement. \"It's simple a matter of adherence to our governance process by which a tour player becomes a board member.\n\n\"Webb remaining in his position as a member of the policy board and PGA Tour Enterprises board through the end of his term provides the continuity needed at this vital time,\" he said. \"We are making progress in our negotiations with the PIF.\"\n\nMcIlroy is certain to stay involved in an unofficial capacity based on his experience of two years on the board and his voice in the game. He was the only European tour member on the PGA Tour board, and McIlroy has cultivated relationships across continents during his career.\n\nHe had said on a British soccer podcast at the start of this year that he met with the PIF governor, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, at the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai in late 2022 and that he returned home and encouraged the tour board to meet with him.\n\nThe framework agreement among the PGA Tour, European tour and PIF was announced June 6, with a deadline to finalize it by the end of 2023. Negotiations continue with little progress.\n\nWoods was among the player directors who went to the Bahamas on March 18 -- Monahan and Henry also attended -- to meet with Al-Rumayyan.\n\nWoods said at the Masters about that meeting, \"I don't know if we're closer, but certainly we're headed in the right direction. That was a very positive meeting, and I think both sides came away from the meeting feeling positive.\"\n\nGorder is the chairman and CEO of Valero, the title sponsor of the Texas Open. He has been appointed the inaugural chairman of the PGA Tour Enterprises board.

For all his anti-LIV Golf rhetoric at times over the past two years, he quickly understood the bigger picture in the aftermath of last year's controversial \"framework agreement\" that saw PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan and PIF governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan appear together for interviews.\n\nThe four-time major champion who last week turned 35 might still be no fan of LIV, but he has recognized the need to bring the game back together and what a deal could mean, even if both sides might have to give up some things that they are stubbornly clinging to at the moment.\n\nMcIlroy even went so far as to invoke \"The Troubles,\" or what's also known as the \"Northern Ireland Conflict\" to make his point. While the long-ago issues in his homeland were of a far more serious nature, he used the eventual \"Good Friday Agreement\" as a point of reference to golf's continuing struggle.\n\nThe 1998 agreement saw both sides have to compromise. But it brought peace to a region that had seen war for three decades.\n\n\"That's sort my little way of trying to think about it and trying to make both sides see that there could be a compromise here,\" McIlroy said at Quail Hollow Golf Club in advance of the Wells Fargo Championship. \"Yeah, it's probably not going to feel great for either side, but if it's a place where the game of golf starts to thrive again and we can all get back together, then I think that's ultimately a really good thing.''\n\nSo what's holding it up?\n\nWell, to McIlroy's point, it is clear that both sides have ideas they are unwilling to give up.\n\nIt would not be surprising to learn that the hardliners on the PGA Tour side want LIV Golf to go away and to exact some penalty on players trying to return.\n\nIf you're the PIF and spent in excess of $2 billion to launch a fledgling league that has disrupted the golf world with pledges of more into the future, why would you want to shutter it?\n\nOn the other side, if you're the Tour and willing to bring LIV along, say, as a separate entity, wouldn't there need to be some cooperation on player movement? Wouldn't LIV need to condense its schedule so there could be some other competitive vehicle -- such as McIlroy's proposed Champions League -- in which all the top players compete?\n\nAnd in that instance, if you're LIV, don't you need to accept that those players are not going to have unfettered access to existing PGA Tour events?\n\nYeah, it's not easy. But to get any kind of an agreement -- and more cash flowing into PGA Tour Enterprises -- some hard decisions are in play. McIlroy has repeatedly floated the idea of events outside of the PGA Tour, worldwide events that bring together the top players. It would be a huge change from what exists now.\n\n\"Maybe our outlook on the future of golf might be a little different than theirs, but look, that's why we have a great team of people, from SSG (Strategic Sports Group), from our tour, from the PGA Tour just all work together,\" said Webb Simpson, a player director on the policy board who had recently proposed that McIlroy replace him. \"There's some smart people a lot smarter than me who are going to figure out those roadblocks and hopefully we get back to producing great golf tournaments at great venues and that's what I'm hopeful for.\"\n\nSimpson is a supporter of McIlroy, viewing him as a \"global superstar\" whose ideas are important.\n\nPerhaps not all see it that way. It's been known for some time that McIlroy and Patrick Cantlay, another board member, are not in agreement on numerous issues (Golf Digest reported sources claiming Cantlay, Jordan Spieth and Tiger Woods were not keen on McIlroy's possible board return.) Woods appears to be pro-Tour all the way but did acknowledge his meeting in March with Al-Rumayyan was productive. He has not shared his ultimate feelings publicly.\n\nWoods is protective of the PGA Tour, and for good reason. It's understandable that the guy whose 82-victory total has been surpassed by no one might want to see that part of his career remain intact, with a reasonable ode to the Tour's history secure.\n\nBut the risks of not making a deal remain: LIV Golf continues to hire and aspire. It has plans going out several years. Sure, it can shut it down in a heartbeat, but that does not appear to be the plan. Greg Norman, the commissioner, has repeatedly said that his mandate from Al-Rumayyan is to keep building. And do you want to lose another player the caliber of Jon Rahm to LIV? What happens when existing LIV player contracts expire? Certainly, the league is going to want to sign new players.\n\nMeanwhile, SSG has committed upwards of $3 billion to PGA Tour Enterprises. The Tour recently announced \"grants\" in the neighborhood of $1.5 billion with vesting to occur over the next eight years that will see nearly 200 players and future members compensated.\n\nThat means a return on investment is necessary. Tyler Dennis, an executive vice president with the PGA Tour, met with reporters on Wednesday in Charlotte at the Wells Fargo Championship and stressed how much the talking points going forward will be about the fans and enhancing the game for them.\n\n\"I'm still optimistic,\" McIlroy said. \"I think Webb staying on (the board) is a really good thing. I think he's got a really balanced voice in all of this and I think he sees the bigger picture, which is great.

Henry, owner of English football team Liverpool, and Joe Ogilvie, a former Tour player appointed as a director liaison in March.\n\nThe subcommittee reports back to the full board.\n\nThe developments capped a day that began with Rory McIlroy losing the inside track on rejoining the board as Webb Simpson\u2019s replacement when board members resisted his return.\n\n\u201cI think there was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason,\u201d McIlroy said at the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, North Carolina, where a US$20 million (HK$156m) signature event is being played.\n\nSimpson had offered to resign, but only if McIlroy were to replace him. When a player director resigns, the other players on the board have to unanimously agree on a successor. McIlroy resigned from the board in November, and the players selected Jordan Spieth to replace him.\n\nThe seven players \u2013 Woods, Spieth, Simpson, Ogilvie, Patrick Cantlay, Adam Scott and Peter Malnati \u2013 are on the board of the PGA Tour and PGA Tour Enterprises, the commercial entity that agreed to a deal with Strategic Sports Group as a minority investor.\n\nThat deal included a US$1.5 billion investment, which could be as much as US$3bn.\n\nMcIlroy was willing to return, believing he could help find a solution to the split in golf that has left some of the best players on two tours. McIlroy sees the reunification in some form as the ultimate goal and rubbed players up the wrong way when he suggested earlier this year that LIV players return without punishment.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s news is in no way a commentary on Rory\u2019s important perspective and influence,\u201d Monahan said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s simple a matter of adherence to our governance process by which a Tour player becomes a board member.\n\n\u201cWebb remaining in his position as a member of the policy board and PGA Tour Enterprises board through the end of his term provides the continuity needed at this vital time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are making progress in our negotiations with the PIF.\u201d\n\nMcIlroy is certain to stay involved in an unofficial capacity based on his experience of two years on the board and his voice in the game. He was the only European Tour member on the PGA Tour board, and McIlroy has cultivated relationships across continents during his career.\n\nHe had said on a British football podcast at the start of this year that he met the PIF governor, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, at the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai in late 2022 and that he returned home and encouraged the Tour board to meet with him.\n\nThe framework agreement among the PGA Tour, European Tour and PIF was announced June 6, with a deadline to finalise it by the end of 2023. Negotiations continue with little progress.\n\nWoods was among the player directors who went to the Bahamas on March 18 \u2013 Monahan and Henry also attended \u2013 to meet with Al-Rumayyan.\n\nWoods said at the Masters of the encounter: \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019re closer, but certainly we\u2019re headed in the right direction. That was a very positive meeting, and I think both sides came away from the meeting feeling positive.\u201d\n\nGorder is the chairman and CEO of Valero, the title sponsor of the Texas Open. He has been appointed the inaugural chairman of the PGA Tour Enterprises board.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Ogilvie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Ogilvie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Monahan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jay Monahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Malnati", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Malnati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Henry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John W.

Several players have voiced both support and opposition to the notion, with McIlroy himself contributing to the conversation.\n\nOne of the most controversial statements that has been made is that Tiger Woods would be among the players who do not want Rory McIlroy back on the policy board. So reported Golf Digest, citing unnamed sources.\n\nThe report indicates that Tiger Woods as well as Patrick Cantlay and Jordan Spieth would be against Rory McIlroy's return. This is a shocking statement, as McIlroy has had a difficult relationship with Cantlay and Spieth, but not so with Woods.\n\nOn the contrary, both Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods have repeatedly spoken about their friendship. The two even reside near each other in Florida and McIlroy has gone so far as to say they talk practically every day.\n\nThe situation is quite different with Cantlay and Spieth. During the 2023 Ryder Cup, Rory McIlroy described the relationship with the former as \"average at best\" while talking about his famous controversy with Cantlay's caddie Joe LaCava.\n\nAs for Spieth, Golf Digest's report recalls that he excluded himself from a chat group after the Texan issued the opinion that striking a deal with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) was no longer as necessary after making a pact with the Sports Strategic Group (SSG).\n\nRory Mcilroy addressed the issue of his supposed return to the Policy Board during an interview before the Wells Fargo Championship. The Northern Irishman surprised the world by saying that it is probably best to leave everything as it is.\n\n\"There was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason,\" McIlroy said. \"I think Webb [Simpson] just stays on and sees out his term.\"\n\nSome opinions on the alleged return of Rory McIlroy\n\nSeveral players have opined on the possibility of Rory McIlroy returning to the PGA Tour Policy Board.\n\nAdam Scott was open to the idea, although he acknowledged that the way the subject came up was rather unusual.\n\n\"Rory [McIlroy] is an important part of this Tour.\" Scott said to Golfweek. \"His voice matters. We have to come together and make a decision as a board how this is going to go forward.\"\n\nOther players were not so happy about the possibility, either because of the irregularity of the situation or because McIlroy resigned as Player Director less than eight months ago.\n\n\"That's just not how democracy works.

Henry of Fenway Sports Group and Joe Ogilvie, a former tour player appointed as a director liaison in March.\n\nThe subcommittee reports back to the full board.\n\nThe developments capped a day that began with Rory McIlroy losing the inside track on rejoining the board as Webb Simpson's replacement when board members resisted his return.\n\nALSO READ: Tiger Woods and world's top 100 named in PGA Championship field\n\n\"I think there was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason,\" McIlroy said at the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, North Carolina, where a $20 million signature event is being played.\n\nSimpson had offered to resign, but only if McIlroy were to replace him. When a player director resigns, the other players on the board have to unanimously agree on a successor. McIlroy resigned from the board in November, and the players selected Jordan Spieth to replace him.\n\nThe seven players -- Woods, Spieth, Simpson, Ogilvie, Patrick Cantlay, Adam Scott and Peter Malnati -- are on the board of the PGA Tour and PGA Tour Enterprises, the commercial entity that agreed to a deal with Strategic Sports Group as a minority investor.\n\nThat deal included a $1.5 billion investment, which could be as much as $3 billion.\n\nMcIlroy was willing to return, believing he could help find a solution to the split in golf that has left some of the best players on two tours. McIlroy sees the reunification in some form as the ultimate goal and rubbed players the wrong way when he suggested earlier this year that LIV players return without punishment.\n\n\"Today's news is in no way a commentary on Rory's important perspective and influence,\" Monahan said in a statement. \"It's simply a matter of adherence to our governance process by which a tour player becomes a board member.\n\n\"Webb remaining in his position as a member of the policy board and PGA Tour Enterprises board through the end of his term provides the continuity needed at this vital time,\" he said. \"We are making progress in our negotiations with the PIF.\"\n\nMcIlroy is certain to stay involved in an unofficial capacity based on his experience of two years on the board and his voice in the game. He was the only European tour member on the PGA Tour board, and McIlroy has cultivated relationships across continents during his career.\n\nHe had said on a British soccer podcast at the start of this year that he met with the PIF governor, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, at the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai in late 2022 and that he returned home and encouraged the tour board to meet with him.\n\nThe framework agreement among the PGA Tour, European Tour and PIF was announced on June 6, with a deadline to finalize it by the end of 2023. Negotiations continue with little progress.\n\nWoods was among the player directors who went to the Bahamas on March 18 -- Monahan and Henry also attended -- to meet with Al-Rumayyan.\n\nWoods said at the Masters about that meeting, \"I don't know if we're closer, but certainly we're headed in the right direction. That was a very positive meeting, and I think both sides came away from the meeting feeling positive.\"\n\nGorder is the chairman and CEO of Valero, the title sponsor of the Texas Open. He has been appointed the inaugural chairman of the PGA Tour Enterprises board.\n\nLatest on SportstarTiger Woods to be lone player on negotiating committee with Saudi-backed LIV Golf APUEFA Champions League 2023-24 semifinal: 'Absolute disaster'- Bayern boss Tuchel slams late offside call ReutersNBA: Nuggets star Nikola Jokic wins MVP for third time in four seasons ReutersUEFA Champions League 2023-24 semifinal: Real Madrid's success down to collective sacrifice, Vinicius says ReutersUCL 2023-24 Semifinal: Joselu helps Real Madrid comeback against Bayern Munich to reach Champions League final APREAD MORE STORIES", "source": {"uri": "sportstar.thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportstar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Ogilvie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Ogilvie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Monahan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jay Monahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Henry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John W.

McIlroy himself had stepped away from the board last November but showed a desire to return.\n\nMcIlroy's return, however, was subject to a vote. It was unclear whether that vote was actually held, but the Northern Irishman admitted he was met with resistance by some on the board.\n\n\"It got pretty complicated and pretty messy and I think with the way it happened, I think it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before,\" McIlroy told reporters in Charlotte, N.C., the day before the Wells Fargo Championship begins.\n\nGolfweek reported Tuesday that Simpson will complete the remainder of his term on the board, which Simpson confirmed Wednesday. The tensions come at a pivotal time in the tour's history as it continues to negotiate with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund amid a civil war with LIV Golf.\n\n\"I think there was -- there was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason,\" McIlroy said. \"I think the best course of action is if, you know, there's some people on there that aren't comfortable with me coming back on, then I think Webb just stays on and sees out his term, and I think he's gotten to a place where he's comfortable with doing that and I just sort of keep doing what I'm doing.\n\n\"So yeah, I put my hand up to help and it was -- I wouldn't say it was rejected, it was a complicated process to get through to put me back on there. So that's all fine, no hard feelings and we'll all move on.\"\n\nMcIlroy said last month the lack of progress in a deal with the PIF had motivated him to jump back in the fray, \"but only if people want me involved, I guess.\"\n\nOn Wednesday he said he remains optimistic, and that Simpson has \"got a really balanced voice in all of this and I think he sees the bigger picture.\"\n\n\"My fear was if Webb stepped off and it wasn't me that was going in his place, what could potentially happen,\" McIlroy said. \"Yeah, I'm really happy that Webb has made that decision to stay on and serve out the rest of his term.\"\n\nGolfweek's report painted Patrick Cantlay at odds with McIlroy. Cantlay is presently on the board and would have had a vote on McIlroy's return. An unnamed tournament director told Golfweek that Cantlay is against striking a deal with PIF while McIlroy is all for reunification.\n\n\"We need Rory back on the board. Had he stayed on he could've neutered Cantlay. He's the only one with the power to neuter Cantlay. We need Rory to try to keep Cantlay from ruining the tour,\" the tournament director said. \"Webb is too nice.\"\n\nGolfweek also quoted former player directors Kevin Streelman and James Hahn as being against the idea of McIlroy being hand-picked to return.\n\n\"He was very clear that it was too much for him,\" Streelman said. \"He had business dealings, he has a kid, he wants to focus on his game. Trust me, I get it. But once you quit, you're not getting back. ... I wouldn't quit on something that you were elected to by your peers. To want back in is peculiar.\"\n\nMcIlroy was asked Wednesday if he can still affect change in the tour from the outside.\n\n\"I sort of liken it to like when Northern Ireland went through the peace process in the '90s and the Good Friday Agreement, neither side was happy,\" McIlroy said. \"Catholics weren't happy, Protestants weren't happy, but it brought peace and then you just sort of learn to live with whatever has been negotiated, right? ...\n\n\"That's sort of how I -- it's my little I guess way of trying to think about it and trying to make both sides see that there could be a compromise here. Yeah, it's probably not going to feel great for either side, but if it's a place where the game of golf starts to thrive again and we can all get back together, then I think that's ultimately a really good thing.\"", "source": {"uri": "deadspin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadspin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golfweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golfweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hahn_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Hahn (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Streelman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Streelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Friday Agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protestantism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/6cf8f87ef6046e3522bb3e5dcf197ca0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

McIlroy resigned from his position in 2023 amidst tensions and was asked to rejoin the board.\n\nJay Monahan made an announcement after the decision of Rory McIlroy not returing to the board was finalised. He said (via Golf Monthly):\n\n\"We are making progress in our negotiations with the PIF and are working as a collective - the player directors, our board and Tour management - to remain open-minded to all avenues that advance the Tour in the best interest of our players, our partners and, most importantly, our fans.\"\n\nMonahan said that the negotiations are progressing since talks about the merger began last year. Since then, the PGA Tour recieved a $3 billion cash injection into the tour and Monahan believes the Tour could use an additional investment from Saudi Arabia's PIF to grow the game.\n\nPGA Tour on Rory McIlroy rejoining the Policy Board\n\nPGA Tour commisioner Jay Monahan talked about Rory McIlroy's return to the PGA Tour policy board.\n\nRory McIlroy said at the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship that his return to the PGA Tour policy board would \"open up some old wounds.\" Earlier at the 2024 Zurich Classic of New Orleans, McIlroy said at a press conference:\n\n\"I think I can be helpful. I don't think there's been much progress made in the last eight months and I was hopeful that there would be. I think I could be helpful to the process. But only if people want me involved, I guess.\"\n\nIf Rory McIlroy were to rejoin the board, Webb Simpson would have to step down to accomodate the former. This left several PGA Tour players uneasy. According to Golf Monthly, Simpson said \"they were looking for the right role\" for McIlroy going forward.\n\nDylan Dethier spoke with Monahan regarding the PGA Tour's policy tensions. Monahan said:\n\n\"Today's news is in no way a commentary on Rory's important perspective and influence.

They live nearby in Jupiter, South Florida and have been friends who play golf socially. But when the Northern Irishman recently agreed with Webb Simpson to replace him as one of the player directors who will ultimately decide if there is a merger with the kingdom's \u00a360 billion Public Investment Fund, his re-inclusion was apparently blocked by a group which included Woods.\n\nWoods remains the biggest name in golf. But as a more active player who has become central in the LIV civil war, McIlroy is a big figure in his own right. Woods and McIlroy have jointly-launched a multi-million dollar golf indoor league and any tension would further light up a landscape already in carnage.\n\nBoth are playing in next week's US&hairsp;PGA, the second major of the season, and as if it was not febrile enough with the LIV players competing and one of the rebels, Brooks Koepka, defending, this will add to the intrigue and recrimination.\n\nTelegraph Sport has learnt that the five player directors - other than Simpson - had the power to decide on McIlroy's re-inclusion and that Woods, along with the supposed ringleader Patrick Cantlay who is against Saudi investment, formed the resistance and won the day 3-2.\n\nMcIlroy did not reveal any identities when asked on Wednesday why his re-institution did not get through, but acknowledged there was a collective against him.\n\n\"There was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason,\" McIlroy said at Quail Hollow, where he was preparing for this week's Wells Fargo Championship. \"I think it just got pretty complicated and pretty messy and I think with the way it happened, I think it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before.\"\n\nMcIlroy had quit the board late last year citing personal and professional reasons. Yet after the board secured more than \u00a31 billion of private US investment at the same time as witnessing barely any progress made in PIF talks, McIlroy declared that, as he would \"rather the men's golf professional landscape survived this, I'm happy to do my bit\".\n\nMcIlroy was initially perhaps the most vocal critic of LIV Golf and even after merger plans were prospectively agreed last summer, he insisted he would rather retire than play on the breakaway circuit. But he has softened his stance and has declared he is \"impatient\" to get a deal done before more big names are lured to LIV, and he believes his sport can take inspiration from the remarkable events in his own country before the turn of the Millennium.\n\n\"I think we've got this window of opportunity to get it done, because both sides from a business perspective I wouldn't say need to get it done, but it makes sense,\" McIlroy said.\n\n\"I sort of liken it to when Northern Ireland went through the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement, neither side was happy. Catholics weren't happy, Protestants weren't happy, but it brought peace and then you just sort of learn to live with whatever has been negotiated, right?\n\n\"That was in 1998 and 20, 25, 30 years ahead, my generation doesn't know any different. It's just this is what it's always been like and we've never known anything but peace. It's my little way of trying to think about it and trying to make both sides see that there could be a compromise here.\"\n\nMcIlroy did not name any individuals who resisted him rejoining the board and insisted that \"there are no hard feelings\". He also emphasised it would have been a \"complicated process\" for him simply to be a direct substitute for Simpson.\n\nMcIlroy has made no secret of his strained relationship with Cantlay, saying \"we see the world quite differently\" and recently had an exchange of views with Spieth after the American suggested the Tour's multi-billion dollar deal with Strategic Sports Group meant investment from the PIF might not be needed.\n\nWoods made similar comments. \"Financially, we don't [need that] right now,\" he said about the Saudi investment following the SSG injection of cash. However, after a player directors' meeting with PIF governor and LIV chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan two months ago, Woods described the talks as \"positive\".

Being the unofficial spokesperson for the PGA Tour during the early days of its battle with LIV Golf and the Saudi PIF had clearly and understandably taken a toll on McIlroy. Tiger Woods joined the board prior to his resignation and Jordan Spieth slid into the seat left by McIlroy.\n\nAll seemed to be okay from a board perspective, at least numbers and name-recognition wise, despite there essentially being zero progress made regarding the framework agreement between the PGA Tour and Saudi PIF.\n\nThat's what made last month's news of McIlroy rejoining the policy board surprising. Webb Simpson was expected to resign, with the sole request being that McIlroy return and take his seat at the table.\n\nMcIlroy's return as requested by Simpson felt inevitable given that Rory has been the posterboy for the Tour for a decade-plus and carries one of the most-influential voices in professional golf.\n\nNot so fast.\n\nDuring his press conference ahead of this week's Wells Fargo Championship, McIlroy explained that he won't be returning to the board and that it is expected Simpson would remain in his position.\n\n\"It just got pretty complicated and pretty messy,\" McIlroy explained.\n\n\"With the way it happened, it opened up some wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before. And I think there was a subset of people on the board who were uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason.\"\n\nWhile he didn't name any names, it's fair to suggest that Patrick Cantlay, who is on the policy board, was among the \"subset of people\" who weren't exactly thrilled with the idea of McIlroy reclaiming his seat.\n\nWhen most hear the names McIlroy and Cantlay together, their minds immediately go to last year's Ryder Cup in Italy when the two, and more specifically Cantlay's caddie Joe LaCava, had a run-in that nearly transpired into a fight in the parking lot.\n\nThe differences between the two have only evolved since then.\n\nA few weeks after he and the Europeans embarrassed Cantlay and the U.S. in the Ryder Cup, McIlroy was quoted saying \"my relationship with Cantlay is average at best\" before going scorched earth.\n\n\"Joe LaCava used to be a nice guy when he was caddying for Tiger, and now he's caddying for that d-ck he's turned into a ... I still wasn't in a great headspace,\" McIlroy told the Irish Independant.\n\nCantlay took the high road - and softer stance - after McIlroy's quote about him being a \"di-k\" made the rounds, suggesting that it was taken out of context.\n\nAfter McIlroy's resignation from the board, it was widely rumored that Cantlay had very much taken the head seat at the table, and a new report shows that there is some serious truth behind those rumors.\n\nIn a story published by Golfweek on Tuesday, a day before McIlory explained he wouldn't be rejoining the board, an anonymous Tour player shared an exchange he had with Cantlay ahead of the Zurich Classic two weeks ago.\n\nCantlay made it clear that a McIlroy return to the board was very much not on the table, at least not at that exact point in time.\n\n\"I asked Cantlay, Is Rory back on the board? He said, No. But Patrick is really smart so I thought about how I phrased the question,\" the veteran player told the outlet.\n\n\"Maybe he was just answering based on this very moment. I said, Pat, I apologize, maybe I asked the wrong question. Did Webb step down? He said, Webb has not stepped down from the board. Then I went higher up and got the full story. Now, it does sound like things change daily out here, maybe hourly, so you never know.\"\n\nIn the same story, an anonymous tournament director talked candidly about Cantlay \"ruining the Tour.\"\n\n\"We need Rory back on the board. Had he stayed on, he could've neutered Cantlay. He's the only one with the power to neuter Cantlay. We need Rory to try to keep Cantlay from ruining the Tour,\" the tournament director said. \"Webb is too nice. A lot of people at the Tour at a very high level are thrilled that Rory is going back on the board for that reason.\"\n\nIt's worth noting, amid what appears to be real drama between McIlroy and Cantlay, that McIlroy has spent the last handful of months talking about how a global tour that mirrors the Champions League in European soccer would be his dream scenario. That idea likely isn't music to the PGA Tour's ears, therefore other powers that be could have also played a role in keeping McIlroy off the board.\n\nWhile the story of McIlroy being denied a spot back on the board continues this new run we're seeing in professional golf where we're getting unprecedented looks behind the curtain, it also continues what feels like a never-ending streak of stories and talking points that have absolutely nothing to do with the golf actually being played.\n\nProfessional golf has long been messy. When it could be cleaned up remains to be a question nobody can even begin to answer.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_harris@outkick.com", "name": "Mark Harris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golfweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golfweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich_Classic_of_New_Orleans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zurich Classic of New Orleans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/05/cantlay-rory.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Henry of Fenway Sports Group and Joe Ogilvie, a former tour player appointed as a director liaison in March. The subcommittee reports back to the full board, according to the AP.\n\nEarlier, McIlroy disclosed that he was willing to rejoin the board that he left in November after being asked by Webb Simpson -- who wanted to step down and have McIlroy take his place.\n\nBut unanimous board approval is required and McIlroy said there was resistance from some to his returning. Simpson subsequently said he will serve the remainder of his term.\n\n\"Today's news is in no way a commentary on Rory's important influence,\" Monahan said in a statement given to Sports Illustrated via the PGA Tour. \"It's simply a matter of adherence to our governance process by which a Tour player becomes a board member.\n\n\"Webb remaining in his position as a member of the Policy Board and PGA Tour Enterprises Board through the end of his term provides the continuity needed at this vital time. We are making progress in our negations with the PIF and are working as a collective -- the Player Directors, our Boards and Tour management -- to remain open-minded to all avenues that advance the Tour in the best interest of our players, our partners and, most importantly, our fans.\"\n\nThe original intent was to have a deal with the PIF -- which backs the LIV Golf League -- by Dec. 31. But that deadline passed and the PGA Tour subsequently made a deal with the Strategic Sports Group, a private-equity company of high-end sports and business owners, with an initial investment of $1.5 billion. The Tour has since announced equity shares that will vest over time to the players.\n\n\"I think there was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason,\" McIlroy said at the Wells Fargo Championship, which begins Thursday.\n\nWoods has said previously he wants to preserve the PGA Tour in its present state.

it's just this is what it's always been like and we've never known anything but peace.\n\n\"It's probably not going to feel great for either side,\" he added. \"But if it's a place where the game of golf starts to thrive again and we can all get back together, then I think that's ultimately a really good thing.\"\n\nMcIlroy is chasing a fourth win at Quail Hollow Club and arrives in fine form after teaming up with fellow Irishman Shane Lowry to win the Zurich Classic of New Orleans last month.\n\n\"I've had a pretty slow start to the season, especially over here in the States,\" he said.\n\n\"I felt like I needed something like that to get me going and, hopefully, that's the case.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Troubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich_Classic_of_New_Orleans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zurich Classic of New Orleans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Friday Agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sectarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protestantism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/9552180334afaa00e31aa9d6aa5e7836", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-31", "textStart": 1506, "textEnd": 1517}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

But last month he revealed a U-turn was in the offing after a plea from Webb Simpson.\n\nThe 2012 US Open champion wanted to vacate his seat on the policy board on the condition that he could be replaced by McIlroy. The policy board is made up of PGA Tour executives, plus six players including Tiger Woods, Jordan Spieth and Cantlay, and it has been at the heart of merger negotiations with the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF).\n\nPIF bankrolls LIV Golf, which sparked a civil war in golf when it launched in 2022 and poached several of the PGA Tour's top stars. PIF, the PGA Tour and DP World Tour have been in merger negotiations since establishing a framework agreement 11 months ago that would enable the world's best players to compete together more often.\n\nREAD MORE: 7 LIV Golf stars earn PGA Championship invite as Talor Gooch and Patrick Reed handed major lifeline\n\nREAD MORE: Luke Donald's Ryder Cup preparation speaks volumes amid Tiger Woods uncertainty\n\nBut a deal is yet to be finalised and McIlroy will play no further part in shaping it in an official capacity. \"It just got pretty complicated and pretty messy,\" McIlroy said ahead of the Wells Fargo Championship, which starts on Thursday at Quail Hollow.\n\n\"With the way it happened, it opened up some wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before. And I think there was a subset of people on the board who were uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason.\"\n\nAccording to a GolfWeek report on Wednesday, one anonymous PGA Tour tournament director expressed their desperation for McIlroy to return to the inner sanctum of the tour due to Cantlay's heightened influence and his supposed unwillingness to do a deal with the Saudis.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US .\n\nConcerns have been raised over Cantlay's influence on the PGA Tour Policy Board\n\n\"We need Rory back on the board,\" they said. \"Had he stayed on he could've neutered Cantlay. He's the only one with the power to neuter Cantlay. We need Rory to try to keep Cantlay from ruining the Tour. Webb is too nice.\"\n\nThe source added: \"The main thing is Cantlay and we've got to get a deal done with the PIF. LIV's got to go away. If we don't get a deal done, we're all ------ in the end. We all know it. [Cantlay] is against it. Rory is for it. So let's get a deal done and get these [guys] put to bed.\n\n\"Do any of us want to work with the Saudis, no? But, on the other hand, none of us want to fight against them and their money for the rest of our careers, either.

They are not businessmen. If you have a high school education how the hell can you vote on multi-billion-dollar finance situations and investment properties? They don't have a clue.\"\n\nMcIlroy and Cantlay are both in the field for Thursday's opening round of the Wells Fargo Championship at Quail Hollow, the site of McIlroy's first PGA Tour victory in 2010.

The icy relationship between Cantlay and McIlroy is \"well-documented,\" but sources said that the McIlroy-Woods relationship has \"also soured over the past six months.\" Beall wrote it \"remains cordial, yet their different views on the future of professional golf has led to a falling out of sorts.\" As for Spieth and McIlroy, the latter removed himself from a player text chain following Spieth's comments at Pebble Beach -- where he said the Tour \"doesn't need\" a deal with the PIF after the deal with SSG -- leading to an \"hour-long chat between the two.\" Tension remained at the Players Championship, where the two played together in the first two rounds and had \"combative moments in the first round regarding two of McIlroy's drops.\" Beall wrote if anyone \"deserves grace, it's McIlroy.\" Beall: \"What he did over two years for the tour and the game brought an invisible pain and weight that can't be measured, and he was sold out by the very thing he was trying to defend.\" However, McIlroy \"did resign an elected spot, and players\" -- and not just on the board -- don't think he \"just gets to simply walk on back.\" There is also the \"perception of a financial entanglement.\" McIlroy is part of the Fenway Sports Group-backed TGL Boston team and FSG is a \"major player\" in SSG. Sources said that McIlroy's team and Tour leadership \"have attempted to sell the board on McIlroy's return,\" which has \"further raised suspicions\" (GOLF DIGEST, 5/8).\n\nDIFFERENT READ: GOLFWEEK's Adam Woodard wrote PGA Tour Policy Board Player Dir Webb Simpson denied \"any negative sentiment towards the world No. 2's potential return to the board.\" Simpson also noted that he \"didn't get any sense that McIlroy wasn't welcomed.\" Simpson: \"I think the players on the board were very supportive of him being more involved, and in those conversations I think they all see the vital role he plays not only on the PGA Tour, but he's a DP World Tour member and they're such an important piece in the game of golf and our Tour\" (GOLFWEEK, 5/8).\n\nSAY IT LOUD: GOLF's Sean Zak wrote McIlroy is \"unafraid to voice his opinions and attach his name to them,\" which puts him on a \"pretty short list among the game's elite.\" But \"not everyone in the Tour membership agrees with those opinions,\" so not everyone agrees with the idea of McIlroy getting his spot back on the board. Zak: \"We do know one thing, though -- he has Simpson's endorsement, even if he won't have his board seat.\" Simpson said that he \"now intends to continue forward through the remaining 20 months of his term\" and will \"clearly work to keep McIlroy closely involved\" (GOLF, 5/8).\n\nLONE RANGER: The AP's Doug Ferguson noted Woods will be the lone player on a five-member subcommittee that will be involved in negotiations with the PIF. The Tour said that Woods will be part of the \"transaction subcommittee\" on the board of PGA Tour Enterprises that will handle day-to-day negotiations as PIF seeks to become a minority investor. Also on the subcommittee are PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan, board Chair Joe Gorder, FSG owner John Henry and board Dir Liaison Joe Ogilvie. The subcommittee \"reports back to the full board\" (AP, 5/8).\n\nPROTECTING WHAT'S BEST: SI's Bob Harig wrote Woods is \"protective of the PGA Tour, and for good reason.\" It is understandable that the guy whose 82-victory total has been surpassed by no one \"might want to see that part of his career remain intact, with a reasonable ode to the Tour's history secure.\" But the risks of \"not making a deal remain: LIV Golf continues to hire and aspire.\" It has plans going out several years. LIV Golf Commissioner & CEO Greg Norman has repeatedly said that his mandate from PIF Gov. Yasir Al-Rumayyan is to \"keep building.\" Harig: \"And do you want to lose another player the caliber of Jon Rahm to LIV? What happens when existing LIV player contracts expire? Certainly, the league is going to want to sign new players\" (SI, 5/8).", "source": {"uri": "sportsbusinessjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "sportsbusinessjournal.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_Digest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf Digest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Players_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Players Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach_Golf_Links", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach Golf Links"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golfweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golfweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA European Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Ogilvie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Ogilvie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Monahan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jay Monahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Rahm", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Rahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Norman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greg Norman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 53}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

In fact, he would step away from the PGA Tour Policy Board as a result of the pressure he had put himself under.\n\nMcIlroy admitted in recent times that he was keen to rejoin the board, with the player keen to push through a deal between the two tours over the coming months. However, it was revealed in recent days that his candidacy had not been accepted by the board members.\n\nSpeaking this week at Quail Hollow, McIlroy said a 'subset of people on the board' had blocked his return.\n\nThere was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason.\n\nI think it just got pretty complicated and pretty messy and I think with the way it happened, I think it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before.\n\nThat came as somewhat of a surprise, especially when you consider his influence on the PGA Tour. The likes of Patrick Cantlay, Jordan Spieth, and Tiger Woods are currently on the board, leading to suggestions that not all is well with Rory McIlroy's relationship with that group.\n\nREAD HERE: Loophole Could Allow LIV Golf Stars To Play For Europe In 2025 Ryder Cup\n\nRory McIlroy does not see eye to eye with Patrick Cantlay, something the Down man has openly admitted in the past. He also has his ups and downs with Jordan Spieth, although they largely seem to get on well.\n\nAs for Tiger Woods, it was previously apparent that the pair had a very close relationship. Woods had taken McIlroy under his wing over the last decade or so, sharing quite a bit of advice with him and spending time together away from the course.\n\nThey were seen as the two driving forces behind recent changes on the PGA Tour, even becoming business partners to set up the upcoming indoor competition The Golf League.\n\nHowever, it has been suggested that the pair are no longer as close as they once were.\n\nAccording to Golf Digest, the relationship between Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods has 'soured' over the last six months or so. In fact, Woods even went as far as to vote against reinstating the 34-year old to the PGA Tour Policy Board.\n\nThis is how their current relationship is summed up.\n\nThe McIlroy-Woods relationship, sources tell Golf Digest, has also soured over the past six months. It remains cordial, yet their different views on the future of professional golf has led to a falling out of sorts.\n\nRory McIlroy is keen for the PGA Tour to come to some sort of arrangement with the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) in order to ensure the long-term health of professional golf.\n\nIt has previously been suggested that Tiger Woods is not as keen on a potential partnership, with Jordan Spieth and Patrick Cantlay openly rallying against any deal with PIF.\n\nThe Telegraph report that Woods voted against McIlroy's return to the board, along with Spieth and Cantlay. Adam Scott and Peter Malnati, the other two players on the board, voted in favour of his return. However, a 3-2 result against the move meant that it was not ratified.\n\nSuch a move would certainly suggest that Woods no longer prioritises his relationship with Rory McIlroy in the way that he once did.", "source": {"uri": "balls.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.balls.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gary_connaughton@balls.ie", "name": "Gary Connaughton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_Digest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf Digest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Scott_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Scott (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://img.resized.co/balls_ie/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLmJhbGxzLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAyNFxcXC8wNVxcXC8wOTEyNTMzMFxcXC9VbnRpdGxlZC1kZXNpZ24tMjAyNC0wNS0wOVQxMjUwNTYuNDU0LnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjoxMjAwLFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6NjI3LFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuYmFsbHMuaWVcXFwvaW1hZ2VzXFxcL2JyYW5kLWltYWdlLmpwZ1wiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiI0YmIwNzRkMzQ4NDVjYTlkZDkwZDI5MjA0N2U1ODYzODg0YmQ4NDE0In0=/reportrorymcilroysrelationshipwithtigerwoodshassouredoverlastsixmonthsballsie.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Simpson, who has been on the board since the start of last year, reportedly tendered his resignation and requested McIlroy take his place.\n\nHowever, ahead of the Wells Fargo Championship, McIlroy confirmed it wouldn't be happening any time soon, saying: \"I think there was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason.\"\n\nThat's something Simpson, who will now stay in his role the full three-year term, has denied. The 2012 US Open champion is also competing at Quail Hollow this week, and speaking to the media beforehand, began by addressing the reason for trying to get McIlroy back on the board.\n\nHe said: \"I think the sentiment was Rory McIlroy, being the global superstar that he is and the strong voice that he has in the game of golf, you know, it would be great to get him involved more.\n\n\"So, you know, what capacity is he going to get involved more? I think three weeks ago we just wanted him more involved, and I think I've seen support from the guys on wanting him more involved and helping.\"\n\nHe added: \"I think the players on the board were very supportive of him being more involved, and in those conversations I think they all see the vital role he plays not only on the PGA Tour, but he's a DP World Tour member and they're such an important piece in the game of golf and our tour.\"\n\nSimpson then denied that there had been any objections to the idea from current board members. He continued: \"No. I think what we had to work through was, you know, where could he - where could his role best be utilized.\n\n\"There's a lot of different roles right now that different players are playing on different committees or us on the policy board or the enterprises board.\n\n\"So they really were looking at it kind of holistically like yes, we want Rory to help, we know he can help and we know he's going to help. Let's all figure out a place where we feel good with saying, can you help us here, and if he feels good, then great, it's a win for all of us.\"\n\nThe move to reinstate McIlroy came at a crucial time with negotiations between the PGA Tour and Saudi Public Investment Fund behind LIV Golf ongoing almost a year after it was first announced talks had begun.\n\nSimpson addressed what he saw as the biggest sticking points.

Amid major debate among golf's leading lights over the sport's trajectory, the PIF-backed tour agreed to a stunning potential merger with the PGA Tour and DP World Tour last summer.\n\nHowever, talks over a \"framework agreement\" to bring this deal to fruition have proven slow, with progress having stalled in the interim period. With this impasse ongoing, Webb Simpson offered to resign from the PGA Tour policy board last month - with McIlroy throwing his hat into the ring to replace him.\n\nThe Northern Irishman's offer to help with negotiations came after he served on the Player Advisory Council in 2019, while also sitting on the PGA Tour policy board between 2021 and last November. However, the 35-year-old's offer appeared to divide opinion within the policy board's inner sanctum and was eventually passed over.\n\nREAD MORE: Rory McIlroy left PGA Tour players' text chain after Jordan Spieth's LIV Golf remarks\n\nREAD MORE: LIV Golf stars earn PGA Championship invite as Talor Gooch and Patrick Reed handed major lifeline\n\nStars including the aforementioned Woods, Patrick Cantlay and Jordan Spieth sit on the policy board, with the four-time majors winner McIlroy having clashed with the latter pair over the sport's future before today. Moreover, Kevin Streelman and James Hahn raised various concerns over the star making a return in this capacity, as per Golf Week.\n\nIn the case of Streelman, he posited: \"He was very clear that it was too much for him. He had business dealings, he has a kid, he wants to focus on his game. Trust me, I get it. But once you quit, you're not getting back, I wouldn't quit on something that you were elected to by your peers. To want back in is peculiar.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Hahn also seemed to be left concerned by the aspect of Simpson essentially hand-picking who should succeed him on the policy board. He asserted: \"That's just not how democracy works. It goes against all the principles of what makes a Tour-run organization.\"\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US .\n\nGiving his own recollections about the fallout from his offer and the subsequent rejection, McIlroy admitted that the process had been tense. He confessed: \"It got pretty complicated and pretty messy. I think it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before.\n\n\"There was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason. I think the best course of action is, if there's some people on there that aren't comfortable with me coming back on, then I think Webb just stays on and sees out his term.\n\n\"I think he's gotten to a place where he's comfortable with doing that and I just sort of keep doing what I'm doing. I put my hand up to help and it was ... I wouldn't say it was rejected, it was a complicated process to get through to put me back on there. So that's all fine, no hard feelings and we'll all move on.\n\nMcIlroy added: \"My fear was if Webb stepped off and it wasn't me that was going in his place, what could potentially happen. I'm really happy that Webb has made that decision to stay on and serve out the rest of his term. I'm impatient because I think we've got this window of opportunity to get it done.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishmirror.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_beattie@irishmirror.ie", "name": "Tom Beattie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hahn_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Hahn (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Streelman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Streelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA European Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talor_Gooch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Talor Gooch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golfweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golfweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senior major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article32654916.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_GettyImages-2149548458.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

They even attended a meeting earlier this year with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund officials for their ongoing negotiation deal.\n\nCantlay recently became embroiled in a controversy involving McIlroy. The Northern Irish golfer was initially one of the Players Directors on the PGA Tour but resigned from his position towards the end of 2023. Later, it was offered to former Masters winner Jon Rahm, who rejected the position and went onto join the LIV Golf. McIlroy was eventually replaced by Spieth.\n\nA recent report then stated that Webb Simpson, set to serve as the Players' Director until 2025, wanted to resign from his position and could potentially be replaced by McIlroy. However, McIlroy will not be rejoining the PGA Tour Policy Board Players' Directors as he was reportedly snubbed by some of the directors, including Patrick Cantlay.\n\nAccording to a report by Golf Digest, sources claimed that Cantlay, Jordan Spieth, and McIlroy's friend Tiger Woods were \"particularly\" against the return of the Irishman.\n\nRory McIlroy opened up about the drama surrounding his potential return in a recent interview ahead of the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship. He stated (as quoted by Independent.co.uk):\n\n\"It just got pretty complicated and pretty messy. With the way it happened, it opened up some wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before.

No hard feelings and we'll all move on.\"\n\nRory McIlroy is all set to tee off at this week's Wells Fargo Championship, where Patrick Cantlay will also play. The tournament will take place from May 9 to 12.\n\nRelationship between Patrick Cantlay and Rory McIlroy explained\n\nRory McIlroy and Patrick Cantlay aren't particularly close. In November 2023, McIlroy discussed their relationship with Cantlay in an interview with the Irish Independent, describing it as \"average at best.\"\n\nSpeaking about the American golfer, McIlroy said (as quoted by ABC News):\n\n\"My relationship with Cantlay is average at best. We don't have a ton in common and see the world quite differently.\"\n\nLast year, during the Ryder Cup, McIlroy found himself in a confrontation with Cantlay's caddie, Joe LaCava. Reports suggest that McIlroy was upset with LaCava for waving his hat in the air while McIlroy was attempting a shot.\n\nThe Norther Irishman allegedly requested him to move, but LaCava didn't cooperate, leading to a heated exchange in Rome. However, things were resolved the following day.\n\nDespite not being close to Patrick Cantlay, Rory McIlroy shares a strong bond with another Players' Director, Tiger Woods. However, according to Golf Digest, the relationship between Woods and McIlroy has deteriorated over the past six months.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ankita_yadav@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Ankita Yadav", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Malnati", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Malnati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Rahm", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jon Rahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Players_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Players Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Scott_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Scott (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_of_Northern_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "People of Northern Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_Digest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf Digest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Irish Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Software", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/c1ffa-17152531768161-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "dateEnd": "2024-05-12", "textStart": 2265, "textEnd": 2276}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The Irishman had offered yesterday to come back to help with the PIF merger negotiations, but due to some discomfort by members of the board, he ultimately did not.\n\nMcIlroy had tried to, in his own words, put up a hand to help the Tour during this process. Given how he left things last time, many didn't want him to just waltz back in. The conversations he had also reminded McIlroy why he left in the first place.\n\nReports now state that Tiger Woods, Jordan Spieth, and Patrick Cantlay were among the Player Directors who felt a little uncomfortable with the return of McIlroy. Fans, however, didn't miss their chance to chime in on the situation.\n\n\"Don't blame Tiger and company, Rory softened his stance on LIV too much,\" another chimed in.\n\n\"You just can't let Rory back on with open arms after he left and did a complete 180,\" one replied.\n\n\"Maybe because Rory changes his mind every year with what he believes,\" another one added.\n\nNot everyone was negative toward McIlroy in this situation. One fan especially believes that Rory McIlroy has figured it out when it comes to what aspects of LIV Golf are actually good.\n\n\"Rory gets it in my opinion. Golf should become more of a global game, which is where LIV is getting it right. He wants what is best for the sport as a whole, not some selfish motives to keep the game here in the U.S.,\" the fan said.\n\n\"Optics would suggest 'you can be on the board as long as you agree with us.' Seems like a dangerous precedent for any organization,\" another said.\n\n\"The Animosity on the PGA tour is childish...like you guys are ALL part of the club,\" one person stated.\n\nThis seems to have divided the golf community, which is essentially how the fans digest most happenings in this sport. There is a divide between the two tours and it has spread into the fanbase.\n\nRory McIlroy changed his mind on Policy Board\n\nBased on all the reports, it's not as if Rory McIlroy could have gotten back on the PGA Tour Policy Board even if he'd kept trying. Despite Webb Simpson's best efforts to resign and give him his spot, the amount of people who didn't like the idea would have likely kept it from happening.\n\nHowever, before it could devolve into that, McIlroy essentially waved the white flag. He understood how everyone felt and opted not to pursue it any further. He firmly believes it was just an offer to help, but he also doesn't feel that he was rejected. The Ryder Cup star said it would have been awkward coming back regardless and he's fine to continue how things are.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_roberts@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Zachary Roberts", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/6391a-17152546667096-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Catholics weren't happy, Protestants weren't happy, but it brought peace and then you just sort of learn to live with whatever has been negotiated, right?\n\n\"That was in 1998 or whatever it was and 20, 25, 30 years ahead, my generation doesn't know any different. It's just this is what it's always been like and we've never known anything but peace.\n\n\"It's my little way of trying to think about it and make both sides see that there could be a compromise here.\n\n\"Yeah, it's probably not going to feel great for either side, but if it's a place where the game of golf starts to thrive again and we can all get back together, then I think that's ultimately a really good thing.\"\n\nMcIlroy explained that the difficulties include convincing PGA Tour hardliners to accept a global schedule.\n\n\"It could be if we go to more of a global schedule, do the American players that are used to playing all their golf in America want to travel outside of the States 12 times a year to play tournament golf, you know? That's a consideration,\" he said.\n\n\"There's the fact that if we all sort of come back together, there's only - I think from the LIV contingent there's only seven players over there that have status, still have status or eligibility here.\n\n\"But would it be palatable to the rest of the membership if they come back with - after seeing out their contract and they've financially got ahead by potentially hundreds of millions of dollars over the people that stayed?\n\n\"That's a consideration.\n\n\"I don't think it's a huge consideration because, you know, it's - again, like if you're just thinking big picture and what's good for the game of golf and what's good for the Tom Kims of the world in 10 or 15 years' time and they're still playing professional golf, you want to set it up in a way where those younger guys have all the same opportunities if not more than the opportunities that we had at that time.\n\n\"So this is - it's not really about the here and now. It is a little bit, but it's also about how does this thing look 10, 15, 20 years down the line.\"\n\nHe added: \"I'm still optimistic. I think Webb staying on is a really good thing. I think he's got a really balanced voice in all of this and I think he sees the bigger picture, which is great.\n\n\"My fear was if Webb stepped off and it wasn't me that was going in his place, what could potentially happen. Yeah, I'm really happy that Webb has made that decision to stay on and serve out the rest of his term.\"\n\nAs for his reasons for wanting to see an agreement, McIlroy pointed to the long term health of the men's professional game, which has been fractured for more than two years following the emergence of LIV Golf.\n\n\"I would say that golf and the PGA Tour has been so good to me over the years, I just feel like it's my obligation or duty to try to give back and try to set the next generation of players up like we were set up by the previous generation,\" he said.\n\n\"So Jack, Arnie, the guys that really helped build the PGA Tour and helped it thrive, and Tiger obviously, to get it to where it is today, I think there's a responsibility with every generation to try to leave the Tour, leave the place that you're playing in a bit of a better spot than it was before.

He will be the sole player on the \"transaction subcommittee\" of the PGA Tour Enterprises board, which will handle day-to-day negotiations as PIF seeks to become a minority investor.\n\nJoining Woods on the subcommittee are PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan, board chairman Joe Gorder, John W.

The subcommittee will report back to the full board.\n\nSponsored: The Cancer Cell-Killing \"Miracle Medicine\" Big Pharma Doesn't Want You To Know About\n\nIn a related development, Rory McIlroy lost the inside track on rejoining the board as Webb Simpson's replacement when board members resisted his return. McIlroy, who had resigned from the board in November, expressed his belief that a \"subset of people on the board\" were uncomfortable with him returning for unknown reasons.\n\nSimpson had offered to resign, but only if McIlroy were to replace him. However, when a player director resigns, the other players on the board must unanimously agree on a successor. The players had previously selected Jordan Spieth to replace McIlroy.\n\nThe seven current player directors -- Woods, Spieth, Simpson, Ogilvie, Patrick Cantlay, Adam Scott, and Peter Malnati -- serve on both the PGA Tour and PGA Tour Enterprises boards. The latter agreed to a deal with Strategic Sports Group as a minority investor, which included a potential investment of up to $3 billion.\n\nDespite the setback, McIlroy is expected to remain involved in an unofficial capacity, given his experience and influence in the game. He has been a proponent of reunification between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf, though his suggestion that LIV players return without punishment rubbed some players the wrong way.\n\nNegotiations between the PGA Tour, European tour, and PIF continue, with little progress reported since the framework agreement was announced on June 6.

He does, however, have his eyes firmly set on what's going on there. The Irishman had a rather unique comparison to the current situation that has grabbed the attention of many.\n\nPer golf reporter Kyle Porter of CBS Sports, McIlroy said:\n\n\"So in terms of I would say I'm impatient because I think we've got this window of opportunity to get it done, because both sides from a business perspective I wouldn't say need to get it done, but it makes sense.\"\n\nHe then added a very interesting comparison of the two sides of this merger:\n\n\"And I just think -- I sort of liken it to like when Northern Ireland went through the peace process in the '90s and the Good Friday Agreement, neither side was happy.\"\n\nThe Ryder Cup star said that after the Good Friday Agreement, neither Catholics nor Protestants were happy with what had transpired. It ultimately did bring some peace and everyone learned to live with what had been negotiated. That would, in his eyes, be how the PGA Tour PIF merger would go down.\n\nHe continued:\n\n\"That was in 1998 or whatever it was and 20, 25, 30 years ahead, my generation doesn't know any different. It's just this is what it's always been like and we've never known anything but peace.\"\n\nMcIlroy said that this view and comparison was primarily his way of seeing both sides of this and envisioning what the future might look like. He admitted that it probably won't feel \"great\" for either side of the merger, but that this is how the game of golf can thrive again, putting the best players back together. That's something he called \"ultimately a really good thing.\"\n\nRory McIlroy cites lack of comfort by board for why he's not coming back\n\nFor a long time, Rory McIlroy was the champion of the PGA Tour. He was on the Policy Board and out on the front lines in the media propping up the Tour and disparaging LIV Golf. That all changed eventually.\n\nThe Irishman ultimately stepped down from that role and softened his stance on LIV tremendously. It sparked false rumors that they'd signed him to a major contract. Today, he's much more amicable towards the tour, and he wants to see golf succeed with the pending merger.\n\nBut he also will not be returning to that role on the Policy Board. Webb Simpson offered to resign and provide McIlroy a spot back where he used to reside, but the 2024 Zurich Classic winner did an about-face.\n\nCiting a discomfort by some members of the board, he decided it was best for Simpson to stay on the board and for McIlroy to remain firmly a player and not get involved with the upper management during this time.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_roberts@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Zachary Roberts", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Good Friday Agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Irishman_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Irishman (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_peace_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland peace process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protestantism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich_Classic_of_New_Orleans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zurich Classic of New Orleans"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Travel", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/ac4ed-17151818758036-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Catholics weren't happy, Protestants weren't happy, but it brought peace and then you just sort of learn to live with whatever has been negotiated, right?\n\nThat was in 1998 or whatever it was and 20, 25, 30 years ahead, my generation doesn't know any different. It's just this is what it's always been like and we've never known anything but peace.\n\nThat's sort of how I...I guess it's my little way of trying to think about it and trying to make both sides see that there could be a compromise here. It's probably not going to feel great for either side but, if it's a place where the game of golf starts to thrive again and we can all get back together, then I think it's ultimately a really good thing.\n\nAn unexpected but admittedly sound analogy from McIlroy.\n\nWhatever peace settlement does arrive between the two factions of world golf, it seems unlikely that Rory McIlroy will play as hands-on a role as many had touted over the past few weeks.\n\nMcIlroy had appeared destined to return to the PGA Tour Policy Board after a hiatus of several months but, in his media duties on Wednesday, he confirmed the move had been blocked by a \"subset of people on the board.\"\n\nIt got pretty complicated and messy, I think, with the way it happened. I think it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before.

He had business dealings, he has a kid, he wants to focus on his game. Trust me, I get it. But once you quit, you're not getting back,\" Streelman told Golfweek.\n\n\"I wouldn't quit on something that you were elected to by your peers. To want back in is peculiar.\"\n\nAnd that opinion was backed up by another former player director James Hahn, who was also uncomfortable with the prospect of Simpson being able to name his successor.\n\n\"That's just not how democracy works. It goes against all the principles of what make a Tour-run organization,\" Hahn added to Golfweek.\n\n\"Imagine if instead of Rory, Webb said he wanted Nate Lashley, who has been vocal against some of the Tour policy decisions, or named me to replace him. There would be an absolute uproar. People would be saying, 'You can't do that.' \"\n\nMcIlroy hinted at the divide when he talked about one of the sticking points with talks over the future being American golfers not wanting a more global schedule.\n\nMcIlroy said: \"It could be if we go to more of a global schedule, do the American players that are used to playing all their golf in America want to travel outside of the States 12 times a year to play tournament golf, you know? That's a consideration.\"\n\nAbout the only thing clear at the moment is that it's not the last we've heard of this, with perhaps a new divide growing even within the PGA Tour along with in men's pro golf as a whole.", "source": {"uri": "golfmonthly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf Monthly Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_higham@golfmonthly.com", "name": "Paul Higham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Streelman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Streelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hahn_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "James Hahn (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Monahan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jay Monahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golfweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golfweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Scott_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Scott (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Lashley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nate Lashley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wHqg2rjJate33Q5TdM37hk-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

That led to his caddy Joe LaCava waving his hat on the green to mock the controversy, but in doing so, he attracted the ire of McIlroy and sparked a confrontation that spilled into the parking lot.\n\nRory didn't attempt to make any amends in the wake of the incident, as he decided to call Cantlay a \"d -- \" in an interview where he discussed what went down. In January, the man at the receiving end of that remark tried to downplay things while asserting they \"had a really good working relationship\" as members of the PGA Tour policy board, but it's hard not to wonder if that's actually the case based on a recent development.\n\nMcIlroy resigned from the PGA Tour board in November 2023 in order to devote more of his attention to his game, but it appeared he was slated to make his grand return when Webb Simpson announced his intentions to step down under the condition he was replaced by Rory.\n\nHis return was contingent on the rest of the members of the board approving the proposal, but McIlroy revealed it wasn't in the card while discussing what transpired on Wednesday prior to the start of the Wells Fargo Championship.\n\nHere's what he had to say:\n\n\"It got pretty complicated and pretty messy, and I think with the way it happened, it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before.\n\nThere was a subset of people on the board who were uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason.

One of them was Adam Scott, who considers the Northern Irishman an important voice on the circuit.\n\nIn an interview with Golfweek, Adam Scott stated that the Policy Board has not yet decided anything about the \"Rory McIlroy case.\" However, the Australian did not hide his good opinion about the Northern Irishman.\n\nThis was part of what Adam Scott said:\n\n\"Rory [McIlroy] is an important part of this Tour. His voice matters. We have to come together and make a decision as a board how this is going to go forward.\"\n\nAdam Scott also discussed how the idea of Rory McIlroy returning to the Policy Board came about. He said the unusual nature of the issue has led the board to take its time defining the way forward.\n\n\"Usually, a player doesn't have a contingency to their resignation and names a successor,\" Scott said. \"Some of the delay is just figuring out what is sensible. It's a shame that it is out in the public. We don't need all the ins and outs and being spread out detail-wise.\n\n\"We have a responsibility to shareholders now. The process matters more than ever. I think the process matters in general.\"\n\nThe Origins of Rory McIlroy's Possible Return to the Policy Board\n\nThe possibility of Rory McIlroy returning to the PGA Tour Policy Board originated from a very unusual proposal from Webb Simpson. Simpson stated that he was willing to resign from his position as Player Director if McIlroy was appointed as his replacement.\n\nThe specific details and reasons for Simpson's proposal have not been fully disclosed. AP quoted an anonymous source as saying that among Simpson's arguments was that the current Policy Board does not have any European members.\n\nInitially, Rory McIlroy said he was ready to return if Simpson's proposal was approved. This is what McIlroy had to say (via Golfweek):\n\n\"I think I could be helpful to the process, but only if people want me involved, I guess.\"\n\nHowever, it seems other Policy Board members are not as in favor of the proposal as Simspon, Scott, or McIlroy. The Northern Irishman declared Wednesday, May 8, that the proposal has opened \"old wounds\" and that it is probably best to leave everything as it is.\n\n\"There was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason,\" McIlroy said, according to The Guardian. \"I think the best course of action is, if there's some people on there that aren't comfortable with me coming back on, then I think Webb just stays on and sees out his term.\"\n\nIn addition to Simpson and Scott, four other Player Directors serve on the Policy Board of the PGA Tour and the newly-formed PGA Tour Enterprises.

McIlroy's return to the Board was supposed to facilitate talks for a potential merger between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf among other things.\n\nHowever, McIlroy recently decided against returning to the PGA Tour Policy Board. This decision has surprised fans and many people from the world of golf have reacted to the same. One such person who commented on the issue is PGA Commissioner Jay Monahan.\n\nOn social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Golf Channel & NBC anchor/reporter Todd Lewis shared images of the remarks by Jay. The Commissioner wrote:\n\n\"Today's news is no way a commentary on Rory's important perspective and influence. It's simply a matter of adherence to our governance process by which a TOUR player becomes a Board member. \"\n\nHe further wrote:\n\n\"Webb remaining in his position as a member of the Policy Board and PGA Tour Enterprises Board through the end of his term provides the continuity needed at this important time. We are making progress in our negotiations with PIF and are working as a collective - the Player Directors, our boards, and TOUR management - to remain open-minded to all avenues that advance the TOUR in the best interest of our players, our partners, and most importantly our fans.\"\n\nGolf legend was reportedly against Rory McIlroy's inclusion on the PGA Tour Policy Board\n\nWhen the news of Rory McIlroy possibly returning to the PGA Tour Policy Board became viral, several fans and golfers were left excited. They believed McIlroy's move would be in the right direction for the future of golf and even for the merger between PGA and LIV Golf.\n\nHowever, there were also a select few who were against the Northern Irishman returning to the PGA Tour Policy Board. As per reports, Tiger Woods was one of the key figures who was against McIlroy's return. The report also stated that apart from Woods, Patrick Cantlay and Jordan Spieth were also against McIlroy's return.\n\nWhile Cantlay and Spieth being against Rory McIlroy can be understood given they did not share the best of relations with the latter, it's hard to understand why Woods would not want McIlroy to return. After all, the duo has always said that they are great friends and that they talk regularly.\n\nHence, it's surprising to see Woods say no to Rory McIlroy's return. Regardless of the reason, McIlroy not returning to the board is final now. This means that fans will only continue seeing him as a golfer.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "varun_anand_bhat@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Varun Anand Bhat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Monahan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jay Monahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_of_Northern_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "People of Northern Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_Channel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/31542-17152565376919-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

So that's all fine, no hard feelings and we'll all move on.\"\n\nThe Co Down man compared the difficulty of the negotiations between the PGA Tour and the PIF to the Northern Ireland peace process of the 1990s.\n\n\"I sort of liken it to like when Northern Ireland went through the peace process in the '90s and the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said.\n\n\"Neither side was happy. Catholics weren't happy, Protestants weren't happy, but it brought peace and then you just sort of learn to live with whatever has been negotiated, right?\n\n\"That was in 1998 or whatever it was and 20, 25, 30 years ahead, my generation doesn't know any different. It's just this is what it's always been like and we've never known anything but peace.\n\n\"It's my little way of trying to think about it and make both sides see that there could be a compromise here.\n\n\"Yeah, it's probably not going to feel great for either side, but if it's a place where the game of golf starts to thrive again and we can all get back together, then I think that's ultimately a really good thing.\"\n\nMcIlroy explained that the difficulties include convincing PGA Tour hardliners to accept a global schedule.\n\n\"It could be if we go to more of a global schedule, do the American players that are used to playing all their golf in America want to travel outside of the States 12 times a year to play tournament golf, you know? That's a consideration,\" he said.\n\n\"There's the fact that if we all sort of come back together, there's only - I think from the LIV contingent there's only seven players over there that have status, still have status or eligibility here.\n\n\"But would it be palatable to the rest of the membership if they come back with - after seeing out their contract and they've financially got ahead by potentially hundreds of millions of dollars over the people that stayed?\n\n\"That's a consideration.\n\n\"I don't think it's a huge consideration because, you know, it's - again, like if you're just thinking big picture and what's good for the game of golf and what's good for the Tom Kims of the world in 10 or 15 years' time and they're still playing professional golf, you want to set it up in a way where those younger guys have all the same opportunities if not more than the opportunities that we had at that time.\n\n\"So this is - it's not really about the here and now. It is a little bit, but it's also about how does this thing look 10, 15, 20 years down the line.\"\n\nHe added: \"I'm still optimistic. I think Webb staying on is a really good thing. I think he's got a really balanced voice in all of this and I think he sees the bigger picture, which is great.\n\n\"My fear was if Webb stepped off and it wasn't me that was going in his place, what could potentially happen. Yeah, I'm really happy that Webb has made that decision to stay on and serve out the rest of his term.\"\n\nAs for his reasons for wanting to see an agreement, McIlroy pointed to the long term health of the men's professional game, which has been fractured for more than two years following the emergence of LIV Golf.\n\n\"I would say that golf and the PGA Tour has been so good to me over the years, I just feel like it's my obligation or duty to try to give back and try to set the next generation of players up like we were set up by the previous generation,\" he said.\n\n\"So Jack, Arnie, the guys that really helped build the PGA Tour and helped it thrive, and Tiger obviously, to get it to where it is today, I think there's a responsibility with every generation to try to leave the Tour, leave the place that you're playing in a bit of a better spot than it was before.

Henry of Fenway Sports Group and Joe Ogilvie, a former tour player appointed as a director liaison in March.\n\nThe issues started nearly two years ago when players began defecting for the rebel LIV Golf league that is funded by PIF.\n\nThe PGA and PIF agreed to a shocking framework deal last June that would ostensibly merge the PGA and LIV.\n\nEleven months later, details remain vague on any progress that has been accomplished.\n\nMeanwhile, the flood of players bolting for LIV has only grown.\n\nThat was led by Jon Rahm's shocking decision to switch tours in December for a reported $450 million.\n\nIn January, Spieth -- who took McIlroy's spot on the board -- questioned whether the PGA needs PIF at all.\n\nSpieth's comments came after a $1.5 billion cash infusion for PGA Tour Enterprises came from a group of high-profile investors, led by Fenway Sports and including Mets owner Steve Cohen.\n\nIt led to McIlroy leaving a group text with Spieth and other players.\n\nThat $1.5 billion, in part, was paid to PGA players as a loyalty reward.\n\nWoods pocketed $100 million, McIlroy $50 million and Spieth $30 million, according to The Telegraph.\n\nAs the players continue to fight over the money, the game remains divided with some of the sport's best playing for LIV, which has garnered minuscule interest from viewers.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_Digest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf Digest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Ogilvie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Ogilvie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Monahan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jay Monahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Rahm", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Rahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Henry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John W.

Rory McIlroy was mentioned as the main candidate to succeed the brilliant Simpson, but the Northern Irishman changed his mind for several reasons.\n\nMcIlroy was close to returning to the PGA Tour Policy Board after deciding to resign from the same position at the end of last year. However, before the start of the Wells Fargo Championship, McIlroy confirmed that it would not happen in the near future, believing that certain individuals are uncomfortable with his return for some reasons.\n\nShortly after McIlroy's statements, Webb Simpson reacted and shared his opinion on everything. Simpson is aware of how important McIlroy is in the world of golf and how influential his voice can be. Simpson believes that this is an opinion shared by his colleagues as well, knowing that Northern Ireland is one of the most popular names, and his involvement can be important for the future of this Tour. Simpson seems to have not noticed any aversion from anyone regarding McIlroy's involvement in the PGA Tour Policy Board.\n\n\"I think the sentiment was Rory McIlroy, being the global superstar that he is and the strong voice that he has in the game of golf, you know, it would be great to get him involved more.\n\nSo, you know, what capacity is he going to get involved more? I think three weeks ago we just wanted him more involved, and I think I've seen support from the guys on wanting him more involved and helping.\"- Simpson said, as quoted by Golf Monthly.\n\nMcIlroy's colleagues were open to his return. In addition to the fact that he would play an important role on the PGA Tour, as a member of the DP World Tour he would give even greater importance to the whole story.\n\n\"I think the players on the board were very supportive of him being more involved, and in those conversations I think they all see the vital role he plays not only on the PGA Tour, but he's a DP World Tour member and they're such an important piece in the game of golf and our tour.\"- he continued.\n\nSimpson clarified that there hadn't been any objections from current board members regarding McIlroy's potential involvement. He explained that they needed to determine where McIlroy's skills could be best utilized. Simpson mentioned that there are various roles that players undertake on different committees, and they wanted to find a place where McIlroy could contribute effectively. The approach was to consider the situation comprehensively and ensure that McIlroy's involvement would be beneficial for everyone.\n\nIt seems that there are still some obstacles for Rory that he doesn't want to directly address but which are preventing him from becoming part of the PGA Tour Policy Board. In his previous term, McIlroy likely had some issues with which he wasn't satisfied. Rory has always been someone who wanted to be in an environment where he could showcase his best and be of assistance. The question is whether such an atmosphere exists at the PGA Tour Policy Board.\n\nWebb Simpson commented on the negotiations between the PGA Tour and PIF, aiming for LIV Golf and the PGA Tour to become one entity. Although it was expected that things would be concluded much earlier, the negotiations are still ongoing. Fans of this sport primarily want the negotiations to come to an end and for the merger to become a reality.\n\nSimpson believes that the priority now is to understand what both Tours want and the direction they intend to take.

I just feel like it's my obligation or duty to try to give back and try to set the next generation of players up like we were set up by the previous generation.\n\n\"So Jack, Arnie, the guys that really helped build the PGA Tour and helped it thrive, and Tiger obviously, to get it to where it is today, I think there's a responsibility with every generation to try to leave the Tour, leave the place that you're playing in a bit of a better spot than it was before. That's what it's about.\"\n\nMcIlroy is back with a scorecard in hand for the first time since he teamed up with Lowry to win the two-man Zurich Classic tournament, a win - the 25th of his career on the US circuit - that could enable him to kick on in his quest for further Majors, starting with next week's US PGA Championship at Valhalla, where he won in 2014.\n\nCertainly, the feelgood factor of that win in New Orleans and, enjoying a week's break after that four-week stretch of tournaments, along with returning to Quail Hollow where he has won three career Wells Fargo tournaments, has a renewed sense of contentment with the state of his game.\n\n\"I think [the win] freed me up a little bit. It's a different win, you're doing it with a partner and you're only having to hit half the shots on a Sunday to get it done. I think it did a world of good for both of us, for Shane and I, just in terms of setting us up for the rest of the season, giving us some confidence knowing that we could get the job done whenever we needed to.\n\n\"I've had a pretty slow start to the season, especially over here in the States. I played well in Dubai those first couple weeks. I felt like I needed something like that to get me going and hopefully that's the case,\" said McIlroy.\n\nLowry - who has played his way into the signature events on the PGA Tour after initially relying on sponsors' invites - too has more freedom in plotting his upcoming schedule, which includes all three remaining Majors and the Olympics but also the probability of finally making it to the season-ending Tour Championship.\n\n\"[The win in New Orleans] is a really good building block for the rest of the summer. I think even though we're only in just beginning of May, the PGA Tour season, it's already half over, there's only half a season left ... these big tournaments come around thick and fast.\n\n\"As well as that, I wasn't going to be in [the field] this week. I had been informed I wasn't going to be getting an invite, so [the win] got me in this week, it gets me in Memorial, it gets me in Travelers. I can plan my schedule pretty nicely, which for me was actually becoming a bit of a headache, because my family go back home [to Ireland] for 10 weeks and I was going to have to stay over here for a little bit longer than I would have liked and I would have been away from them for longer than I normally like,\" said Lowry.\n\nThe course: Quail Hollow Golf Club - 7,558 yards, par 71 - was originally designed by George Cobb but has undergone redevelopment over time, initially by Arnold Palmer and most recently by Tom Fazio ahead of the 2017 staging of the US PGA Championship. The closing stretch of holes known as The Green Mile takes in the run from the 16th to the 18th holes. The finishing hole is a 494 yards par 4 that features a creek working its way along the left side of the narrow fairway and up to the green. Since last year's tournament, all the tees and greens (installed with a new drainage system) have been redone while the bunkers were also overhauled.\n\nThe field: Ludvig \u00c5berg's withdrawal has reduced the limited field to 69 players, with Scottie Scheffler - the world number one and two-time Masters champion - also absent for this latest PGA Tour signature event, which comes a week ahead of the season's second Major, the US PGA Championship. Rory McIlroy, the world number two, comes in invigorated by a win in the Zurich Classic where he successfully teamed-up with Shane Lowry. McIlroy is a course specialist (a three-time winner) while Max Homa has won twice. Wyndham Clark, the US Open champion, is also defending the title he won last year.\n\nQuirky fact: The moniker of the Green Mile given to the closing stretch of holes was inspired by a local radio sports talkshow when a caller suggested the name, based on the Stephen King novel. The Green Mile is a prison term for the final walk a death-row inmate makes to the execution chamber!\n\nQuote-Unquote: \"This course suits longer hitters. I'm not short, but I'm not one of the longer guys. I just feel like I need to not try to be one of the longer hitters this week, you kind of get what I'm saying? A lot of holes out here, you stand on the tee and it makes you want to hit the ball hard off the tee and I feel like if I can get the ball in play and hit the fairways I can be dangerous because my iron play is my strength\" - Shane Lowry on his course strategy for Quail Hollow.\n\nIrish in the field: Three of them: Shane Lowry is in a group alongside Wyndham Clark and Xander Schauffele (off the 10th tee, 4.22pm Irish time); S\u00e9amus Power is grouped with Si Woo Kim and Patrick Rodgers (off the first tee, 4.44pm Irish time), and Rory McIlroy is in a group with Tom Kim and Max Homa (off the first tee, 5.39pm Irish time).\n\nBetting: No surprise that Rory McIlroy returns to a familiar position heading the market (in the absence of Scottie Scheffler and following his return to winning ways in New Orleans) with the Northern Irishman rated a 13-2 shot ahead of Xander Schauffele who is 9-1. Max Homa is a course specialist and is a 20-1 shot, while Shane Lowry is available at 60-1 and S\u00e9amus Power a 125-1 shot.\n\nOn TV: Live on Sky Sports Golf (featured groups from 12.30pm, full live coverage from 7pm).\n\nThe course: A classic, old-style course - with the hands of AW Tillinghast in its original design and then updated by Robert Trent Jones Snr in the 1950s and more recently Roger Rulewich in 2000 - it is a tournament venue steeped in history, even featuring in some episodes of the television drama series The Sopranos. Past winners of various tournaments at Upper Montclair Country Club include Arnold Palmer on the PGA Tour and Nancy Lopez on the LPGA Tour. The tight, tree-lined course measures 6,656 yards, playing to a par 71 and is noted for its sloping greens.\n\nThe field: World number one Nelly Korda - who is on a five-straight winning streak - is the headline act and will again be the player to beat. Korda missed the cut in this event last year, when it was won by Jin Young Ko for the third time in four stagings. Korda is aiming to create history by becoming the first player to win in six consecutive appearances on the LPGA Tour. Among the Major champions competing are Celine Boutier, Ruoning Yin, Brooke Henderson, Hanah Green, Anna Nordqvist and Patty Tavatanakit.\n\nQuirky fact: This tournament honours the 13 founding members of the LPGA Tour ... and this is be the 13th staging of the event. Lucky for someone!\n\nQuote-Unquote: \"I really love the test of this golf course. The rough is always a little bit thicker here and it's quite tight off the tee ... I just like the character of the golf course. It's just a little bit different\" - Australia's Minjee Lee, winner in 2022 and runner-up last year.\n\nIrish in the field: Stephanie Meadow is in a group with Caroline Masson and Yu Liu (off the 10th, at 5.37pm Irish time); Leona Maguire is grouped with Americans Angel Yin and Alison Lee (off the first, at 6.21pm (Irish time).\n\nBetting: Nelly Korda is a red-hot favourite, priced at 4-1 with Brooke Henderson the next in the market at 16-1. Korda's form has been sensational but the trickier, narrower confines of this course may negate her length advantage off the tee, so it is worth looking for some each-way value with Minjee Lee at 33-1. Leona Maguire is a 40-1 chance and Stephanie Meadow is on offer at 150-1.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Sort of reminded me partly why I didn't,\" McIlroy said, referencing his departure. \"I think it got pretty complicated and pretty messy, and I think with the way it happened, I think it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before.\n\n\"There was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason. ... I think Webb just stays on and sees out his term, and I think he's gotten to a place where he's comfortable with doing that and I just sort of keep doing what I'm doing.\"\n\nAnd now Golf Digest claims to know which of the big names were opposed to McIlroy's returns. They include the legendary Tiger Woods, Jordan Spieth and Patrick Cantlay. It's thought cantlay in particular is an opponent of McIlroy, who admitted that the pair aren't exactly best mates.\n\nHe said last year: \"My relationship with Cantlay is average at best. We don't have a ton in common and see the world quite differently.\"\n\nThat came after an infamous spat between McIlroy and Cantlay's caddie Joe LaCava during the Ryder Cup. McIlroy added: \"LaCava used to be a nice guy when he was caddying for Tiger, and now he's caddying for that d--k he's turned into a ...

This will surely be a source of concern in the European locker rooms, especially after Rory McIlroy's attempts to rejoin the PGA Tour board were blocked by Woods and two other player directors in Patrick Cantlay and Jordan Spieth.\n\nAustralian Adam Scott is the only non-American on the board, which will ultimately have the power to veto any deal agreed with PIF. There are fears that US insularity will scupper the deal-making. McIlroy explained as much after revealing that \"there was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason\".\n\nHowever, the Northern Irishman believes that the American pros need to compromise and row in behind the concept of a global circuit, which is the obvious solution to the LIV split. \"Do the American players that are used to playing all their golf in America want to travel outside of the States 12 times a year to play tournament golf?\" McIlroy said. He also reiterated his conviction that LIV rebels should be able to return unpunished.\n\nMcIlroy's opinions clearly do not chime with some of the main characters in this increasingly torrid saga.\n\nWebb Simpson had told the board he would step down, but only if McIlroy could take his place. In a stunning move, Woods and co voted this down, meaning Simpson stays on and that McIlroy's influence as a big voice who believes a deal should be done as quickly as possible with PIF to end the civil war, remains on the outside.\n\nMonahan tried to play down the McIlroy snub. \"Today's news is in no way a commentary on Rory's important influence,\" Monahan said in a statement released to US media. \"It's simply a matter of adherence to our governance process by which a Tour player becomes a board member.\"\n\nThat explanation does not make much sense, seeing as Woods and Spieth were appointed in much the same way. McIlroy's rejection inevitably caused consternation on this side of the pond.\n\nWhen it emerged last month that McIlroy was eager to resume his role of the board that he quit last year after becoming exasperated at the snail-pace of the negotiations, Kinnings said he would \"wholeheartedly welcome\" the development.\n\n\"I was always delighted to have European representation,\" Kinnings said. \"I think it is far better to have a global view and Rory truly has that.\"\n\nConsidering the international nature of his Tour, Kinnings' wish for a worldwide answer to unify the game is unsurprising. \"The American players realising that they will have to travel to enhance their brands is something they will have to compromise on,\" Kinnings said. \"If we all recognise that the game will be damaged without a solution I think the players will come round.\"", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri":

That's a consideration,\" he said when asked about potential differences that could be hampering negotiations.\n\n\"There's [also] the fact that if we all sort of come back together - would it be palatable to the rest of the membership if they come back after seeing out their contract and they've financially got ahead by potentially hundreds of millions of dollars over the people that stayed.

The policy board, made up of six player directors and the tour's executives, is at the forefront of negotiations with LIV Golf backer the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF), with merger talks dragging on.\n\nBut McIlroy revealed on Wednesday a \"subset\" of the player-directors were not keen for him to return and his attempt to rejoin was rejected. The four-time major champion did not name names, but according to Golf Digest, he was referring to Patrick Cantlay, Jordan Spieth and long-time friend Tiger Woods, with their relationship souring due to clashing opinions over the future of the professional game.\n\nMcIlroy's decision to resign from the policy board last year doubtless played a role in players' reservations over his return. At the time, McIlroy said he wanted to prioritise his game and his personal life, with his time as the tour's de facto spokesman in the feud with LIV Golf taking its toll.\n\nREAD MORE: LIV Golf stars earn PGA Championship invite as Talor Gooch and Patrick Reed handed major lifeline\n\nREAD MORE: Luke Donald's Ryder Cup preparation speaks volumes amid Tiger Woods uncertainty\n\nMcIlroy admitted things got \"complicated and messy\" when he tried to negotiate his return to the policy board, and added: \"With the way it happened it opened up some wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before. And I think there was a subset of people on the board who were uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason.\"\n\nBody language expert Judi James told Mirror Sport the 35-year-old cut the figure of a man not telling the full story at his press conference on Wednesday. She said: \"McIlroy's apparent attempt to be tactful and to choose his words carefully here seems to have produced a raft of conflicting signals and signs of emotional suppression.\n\n\"His biggest gesture comes at the start when he says 'It got messy' and, for no apparent practical reason, he spends a long time rubbing his right eye with his finger, producing eight rubs in total.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US .\n\n\"There could be several reasons for this gesture. Eye-rubbing is a common signal of sleepiness in children and he could be suggesting he's tired of the subject or feigning a state of relaxation. It could also be an act of distraction, though, which is a trait animals use when they have their eye on a prey. They will often suddenly stop to lick or scratch themselves to make the prey think they have been saved and forgotten when in fact they are about to strike. Or it could be a partial eye cut-off, suggesting he is not keen to share his inner feelings too openly.\"\n\nJames says the smirk McIlroy briefly showed was telling. She explained: \"When he refers to 'old wounds' and 'scar tissue' he uses eye contact with the interviewer, which prompts a wry smile that pulls up one side of his mouth and cheek, suggesting he is making an understatement. He then looks down and performs a mouth clamp to suggest regret, a mood that is added to when he smacks his lips together in a tutt.\n\n\"He appears to try to make light of things with one shoulder shrug and frown as he talks about the board although when he speaks about them possibly being 'Uncomfortable with me coming back on' he squints one eye in a 'taking aim' gesture.\n\n\"There is another wry smile as he speaks of 'the best course of action' but then he clamps his lips and they perform a squirm that suggests he's suppressing emotions here. He falters as he goes to say 'I'm happy' and there is a long eye cut-off, again to hide or shield his inner feelings.\"\n\nMcIlroy will hope to put the off-course drama aside when he tees it up at the Wells Fargo Championship at Quail Hollow on Thursday.

At the pre-tournament press conference of the Wells Fargo Championship, the Northern Irishman revealed that he had withdrawn his application after some people on the board raised concerns about having him back. He labeled things as getting \"pretty complicated and pretty messy\" and informed that Webb Simpson would remain in his position until the end of 2025.\n\nIn a recent episode of the Golf Channel Podcast, golf analyst Rex Hoggard stated that 'messy' was the right word to describe McIlroy's condition. He suspected some sort of rift between the four-time major winner and other player directors on the PGA Tour.\n\n\"I think 'messy' is the perfect word. Because you look at how this went down and this isn't necessarily, if you look at just the nuts and bolts of this and the facts, I don't think there's anything extraordinary here that would have ruffled feathers, the way it ended up ruffling feathers.\"\n\nThe golf analyst also claimed that the Tour was protecting another Policy Board player director in a \"shady way.\"\n\n\"In this particular case, it looks like the tour is taking care of another player director. It looks like they're circumventing the electorate. It looks like they're doing this in a shady way.\"\n\nFollowing the Players Championship, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan, the Policy Board Player Directors, and Saudi PIF Chief Yasir Al-Rumayyan had a meeting in The Bahamas. Rex Hoggard claimed that McIlroy and Yasir have \"vastly different\" opinions for men's professional golf in the next 15 or 20 years.\n\nHe also noted that Patrick Cantlay, who is one of the Player Directors, has a different vision from McIlroy. And that could be one of the reasons, why the Northern Irishman's plea to make a return to the Policy Board was rejected.\n\nAlso, since Tiger Woods' opinion matters the most, Hoggard suspected that Woods does not stand on the same side as his TGL partner.\n\nAlthough Woods may be the most successful and biggest superstar in the golf world right now, McIlroy is the most influential figure on the PGA Tour. They did share a great bond outside the golf course, yet it seems that their relationship has turned sour in the past few months.\n\nAfter McIlroy announced that his plea to return to the Policy Board was rejected due to some \"subset of people on the board\", it seems that he is not on good terms with Woods. As per a Golf Digest report, the Northern Irishman keenly wanted the Tour to crack a deal with the Saudi PIF to unify the game, but that does not align with what Woods and his Policy Board colleagues want.\n\nAs per The Telegraph report, Patrick Cantlay, Jordan Spieth, Peter Malnati, and Tiger Woods voted against McIlroy taking Webb Simpson's spot as Player Director.\n\nWoods and McIlroy are the co-founders and partners of the upcoming indoor golf league called the TGL. If their relationship has indeed worsened, it remains to be seen if that affects their partnership in the upcoming tech-based league. TGL's launch was postponed to 2025 after an unforeseen accident caused the roof of the venue to collapse. Jon Rahm has already backed out of competing in the new league and with the fallout between Woods and McIlroy, who knows what's in store for the TGL going ahead.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kunal_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Kunal Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_Channel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Monahan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jay Monahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Players_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Players Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Malnati", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter Malnati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Rahm", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Rahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_Digest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf Digest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2023/11/79786a6b-untitled-design-12.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Some are pleased that it's happening, while others view it less favorably.\n\nThe latter group includes James Hahn, a player with two PGA Tour victories and ranked 409th in the Official World Golf Ranking. For Hahn, the way the idea of McIlroy's return coming about is highly questionable. Hahn told Golfweek:\n\n\"Imagine if instead of Rory (McIlroy), Webb (Simpson) said he wanted Nate Lashley, who has been vocal against some of the Tour policy decisions, or named me to replace him. There would be an absolute uproar. People would be saying, 'You can't do that.'\"\n\n\"That's just not how democracy works. It goes against all the principles of what makes a Tour-run organization,\" he added.\n\nLogically, James Hahn was not the only one with opinions of this sort. Another veteran of two wins on the circuit, Kevin Streelman, ranked 185th in the world, sees the issue as \"peculiar.\" He said:\n\n\"He (Rory McIlroy) was very clear that it was too much for him. He had business dealings, he has a kid, he wants to focus on his game. Trust me, I get it.\n\n\"But once you quit, you're not getting back. I wouldn't quit on something that you were elected to by your peers. To want back in is peculiar.\"\n\nRory McIlroy acknowledged on Wednesday, May 8, that his alleged return to the PGA Tour Policy Board had not sat well with some of his colleagues, including some Player Directors. The Northern Irishman went so far as to say that it's preferable that everything stays as it is.\n\nHe said (via Bunkered):\n\n\"With the way it happened it opened up some wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before. And I think there was a subset of people on the board who were uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason.\"\n\n\"I think the best course of action is if there is some people on there who aren't comfortable with coming back on, then I think Webb stays on and sees out his term.\"\n\n\"We need Rory back on the board\" - PGA Tour director\n\nThe issue of Rory McIlroy returning to the PGA Tour Policy Board has been so much carried back and forth this week that statements from an anonymous source even surfaced, which added fire to the debate.\n\nGolfweek anonymously quoted a tour director as saying:\n\n\"We need Rory back on the board. Had he stayed on he could've neutered Cantlay. He's the only one with the power to neuter Cantlay. We need Rory to try to keep Cantlay from ruining the Tour...\"\n\n\"Rory wants Jimmy Dunne to be the negotiator, not the players.

I wouldn't say it was rejected; it was a complicated process to get through to put me back on there. So that's all fine, no hard feelings and we'll all move on.\"\n\nMcIlroy is pleased Simpson is staying on, but he fears time is running out for his dream of seeing a global tour.\n\n\"I'm impatient because I think we've got this window of opportunity to get it done because both sides from a business perspective I wouldn't say need to get it done, but it makes sense,\" he said, comparing the stalemate to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that ended decades of violence in Northern Ireland.\n\n\"I sort of liken it to like when Northern Ireland went through the peace process in the '90s and the Good Friday Agreement. Neither side was happy. Catholics weren't happy, Protestants weren't happy, but it brought peace and then you just sort of learn to live with whatever has been negotiated, right?\n\n\"That was in 1998 and 25 years ahead, my generation doesn't know any different. It's just this is what it's always been like and we've never known anything but peace.\n\n\"That's sort of my little way of trying to think about it and trying to make both sides see that there could

He'd look at them on the opening tee, and they'd be nervous, or jittery, or unsure what to do now that they were at the precipice ... and he had them. The moment of truth had arrived for them, and they weren't up to it.\n\nGolf's moment of truth is here, and the sport is badly flailing. Half the sport's best or most notable players play on one tour, half on the other. They all only come together at the four majors -- the next one, the PGA Championship, tees off next week -- and then spiral off into their own tournaments, cashing massive checks in front of rapidly dwindling audiences.\n\nFans, fed up with the desperate posturing and the unending chaos, are finding other things to do with their Sunday afternoons. When , it's time to pay attention, because something is very wrong in the world of golf.\n\nIt's been nearly a year since the PGA Tour and the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund, the financial backer of breakaway tour LIV Golf, announced a dramatic, surprise \"framework agreement\" that was supposed to be the road map for a new era in men's professional golf, ushering in a world where the best would compete head to head, sponsors would be happy, and everyone involved would get so, so rich ... oh, and fans would maybe enjoy it, too. Probably.\n\nNone of that has happened. The Tour and PIF blew right through their self-imposed Dec. 31 \"deadline\" for getting an agreement done. Both sides have done some not-so-subtle saber-rattling: The Tour decided to bring another date to the dance by getting other outside investment from the Strategic Sports Group, a consortium of American sports owners; the PIF responded by sniping Jon Rahm out from under the Tour's nose.\n\nNo one knows exactly what's going on, because no one's talking. We don't mean that in a \"no one is talking to the media,\" we mean that literally -- apparently no one involved with the Tour or the PIF is even holding regular discussions. Guy Kinnings, the head of the DP World Tour (formerly the European Tour), seemed to indicate recently that the heads of the PGA Tour, the PIF, the DP World Tour and SSG haven't even met in any formal negotiating sessions.\n\n\"From my perspective, all I want to do is make sure we as quickly as possible get the right people around a table to talk about what can a future look like,'' Kinnings said recently in an . \"But until you get into the room with the right people with the right intent to try and find a solution, you are never going to work out a deal and, at the end of the day, this is what is needed right now as quickly as we can.\"\n\nThe latest blow to any kind of unity came this week, when Rory McIlroy and thus wouldn't have an active, out-front voice in any ongoing negotiations. McIlroy understandably dropped off the board last year after getting backstabbed by the Tour; he'd spent years caping for the PGA Tour only to be taken by surprise by the framework agreement announcement.\n\nAfter recognizing the inevitability of Saudi wealth in sports, however, McIlroy has spent recent months advocating for a resolution, and would have likely tried to move negotiations in that direction. He's also strongly indicated that the PGA Tour may need to get comfortable with compromising its America-centric worldview.\n\n\"If we go to more of a global schedule,\" he said Wednesday, \"do the American players that are used to playing all their golf in America want to travel outside of the States 12 times a year to play tournament golf, you know? That's a consideration.\"\n\nSuch sentiments won't endear him to the Tour hardliners. But again, we don't know what anyone's thinking because no one's talking and no movement is happening. We can go on rumor and speculation -- McIlroy has had public disagreements with board members Jordan Spieth and Patrick Cantlay -- but the end result is that a voice that would have apparently pushed negotiation and global perspective won't be on the board.\n\nShortly after McIlroy made his announcement, PGA Tour Enterprises -- the for-profit corporate offshoot of the PGA Tour -- announced its five-member \"transaction subcommittee\" that will negotiate with the PIF. The subcommittee includes familiar names -- PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan, SSG principal and Red Sox owner John Henry, and some guy named Woods -- who will apparently be tasked with moving this process forward from the PGA Tour side.\n\nIf this feels a whole lot like corporate triplespeak -- we're planning to consider negotiating a potential framework for outlining the discussion of planned outcomes for an exploratory session to begin talks -- well, you're not wrong. The entire sport is still standing on the first tee, waggling back and forth, paralyzed ... and all the fans want is for someone to just swing away and get this whole fiasco moving again.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA European Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Senior major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicklaus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Nicklaus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Rahm", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Rahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Monahan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jay Monahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6ok2ILqC4NJYEkhH2XOPfQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/43d629c0-0e0c-11ef-b7f7-c06f00350b24", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-31", "textStart": 1608, "textEnd": 1615}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

McIlroy, who arrives off a win with pal Shane Lowry two weeks ago at the 2024 Zurich Classic, will make his 13th career start at this golf course (12 Wells Fargo Championships, one PGA Championship).\n\nIn that span of time, Rory has amassed five top fives, eight top 10s and just one missed cut (2011 Wells Fargo Championship), when he was just 22 years old. He has only lost strokes from tee to green one time in 12 appearances and has more tournaments in which he has gained 3+ strokes per round on the field per round (four) than tournaments in which he has lost strokes to the field (one).\n\n\"Always good to be back at Quail,\" McIlroy said Wednesday. \"Not just one of my favorite stops on Tour, but one of my favorite cities in America. I've had so many great memories here from over the years, first win on Tour and obviously winning here a few times, and I guess the support that I've had from this community and the support that this tournament's had from this community over the years, it's always been great to experience that. So yeah, great to be back. Looking forward to trying to get my fourth one here.\"\n\nOf the players in the field this week, McIlroy has far and away been the best on this golf course throughout his career. Here are the top five in strokes gained:\n\nRory McIlroy: 2.62Justin Thomas: 2.12Rickie Fowler: 2.07Jason Day: 1.99Viktor Hovland: 1.97\n\nOnly three golfers have a career average over 2.0 strokes gained per round, and McIlroy is closer to 3.0 than he is 2.0. These are astounding numbers.\n\nMcIlroy has won here often. His first PGA Tour victory in 2010. His seven-shot rout in 2015 over Webb Simpson and Patrick Rodgers. And finally in 2022 when he beat Abraham Ancer by one and Viktor Hovland and Keith Mitchell by two.\n\nWithout Scottie Scheffler in the field, McIlroy is suddenly a 13/2 favorite to win the Wells Fargo Championship. The only other golfer entering in the single digits is Xander Schauffele at 9-1.\n\nThat does not make Rory a shoe-in. His iron play has been up and down this year. He finished T47 at this course one year ago due to struggles with that iron play. He has a lot at stake next week at the 2024 PGA Championship where he won in 2014; it would be easy to look ahead at a juicy major possibility.\n\n\"Iron play really feels like it's coming around,\" said McIlroy. \"[Winning the Zurich Classic] was the end of a four-week stretch for me, so I took a few days off when I got back home, hit balls for the first time Sunday. Sometimes to take a bit of a break and just think about it rather than actually doing it can help as well. I got here Monday pretty early and have done some good practice. Yeah, I don't know if it's this place and I just feel good here, but it feels like it's all starting to come around, which is great to see.\"\n\nThere are few better course fits on the PGA Tour than McIlroy at Quail Hollow. He absolutely decimates the place with his driver, which makes sense because it is a course where you can hit driver everywhere because distance matters significantly. In 12 starts, he has never lost strokes off the tee.

and instead said they were looking for the right role for the four-time Major champion to play going forward.\n\nAs confusion reigned, Golf.com's Dylan Dethier managed to get a comment from under-fire commissioner Monahan - who again has been quiet as the rumours fly around.\n\n\"Today's news is in no way a commentary on Rory's important perspective and influence,\" Monahan said in his statement to Dethier, which he posted on X.\n\n\"It's simply a matter of adherence to our governance process by which a Tour player becomes a board member.\n\n\"Webb remaining in his position as a member of the Policy Board and PGA Tour Enterprises Board through the end of his term provides the continuity we need at this vital time.\"\n\nMonahan still did not clarify what role, if any, McIlroy will take up moving forward, with reports continuing of uneasy relationships between him and other board members.\n\nOn the subject of the negotiations between the PGA Tour and PIF, there was an update, of sorts, from Monahan, which simply said talks are progressing.\n\nIt's about 11 months since that controversial framework agreement was announced in a shock TV appearance from Monahan and PIF boss Yasir All-Rumayyan.\n\nSince then the PGA Tour has done a $3billion deal with Strategic Sports Group (SSG) but insists there is still room for PIF involvement.\n\nBut it's now a case of Monahan having to keep his own side settled and working together as they try and move forward with healing golf's big divide.\n\nMonahan's statement concluded: \"We are making progress in our negotiations with the PIF and are working as a collective - the player directors, our board and Tour management - to remain open-minded to all avenues that advance the Tour in the best interest of our players, our partners and, most importantly, our fans.\"", "source": {"uri": "golfmonthly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf Monthly Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_higham@golfmonthly.com", "name": "Paul Higham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Monahan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jay Monahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EYmmd37sGGN5nzhRnYf6kD-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

A lot of people at the Tour at a very high level are thrilled that Rory is going back on the board for that reason.\"- he said, as reported by Golf Monthly.\n\nIf a merger occurs between the PGA Tour, it could entail many changes regarding the PGA Tour, as they would likely need to adapt to LIV Golf in some aspects, and vice versa. Rory is someone who believes that the globalization of golf would be a great thing, with a focus on playing tournaments outside of America.\n\nAn anonymous tournament director seems to have a somewhat different opinion.\n\nHe emphasizes that there are many things he's not happy about regarding Rory.\n\nHe confirmed that the agreement with PIF is a priority, as with that agreement, things could be significantly better for all parties, especially the PGA Tour. It's evident how much this director dislikes Cantlay, considering that he's hindering negotiations, while Rory, on the other hand, would be crucial in reaching a final agreement.\n\n\"Rory wants the Irish Open and other international events to be promoted and smaller fields and larger purses. There's a lot we don't like about Rory and his deal.\n\nBut the main thing is Cantlay and we've got to get a deal done with the PIF. LIV's got to go away. If we don't get a deal done, we're all screwed in the end. We all know it. (Cantlay) is against it. Rory is for it. So let's get a deal done and get these (guys) put to bed.\"- he continued.\n\nHe further emphasized that nobody wants to work with the Saudis, but at this moment, there's no other option for them. They are aware that it's challenging, or rather impossible, to compete with the Saudis considering their financial power.\n\nHe once again put the spotlight on Cantlay, believing that he's blocking negotiations between the PGA Tour and PIF.\n\nJudging by the statements of an anonymous director, Rory wants Jimmy Dunne (an independent director) to be the negotiator, not the players.\n\nHe believes that players should vote on matters concerning rules, not negotiate, especially now that the future of golf is uncertain.\n\nThe anonymous director doesn't want individuals without a high school or educational background to negotiate when it comes to such huge sums of money, believing that they don't understand business. He wants to see a strong businessman leading the negotiations and bringing things to a conclusion.\n\nRory McIlroy confirmed today that he has no intention of returning to the PGA Tour Policy Board. The Northern Irishman admitted that he has held many discussions with the intention of returning, but there are obstacles preventing him from resuming his old role.\n\nHe emphasizes that things are complicated, and old wounds are still open. McIlroy is a supporter of merging with LIV Golf, expecting the agreement to be reached as soon as possible.\n\nAlthough he was against the deal with PIF, he realized that he cannot prevent PIF and LIV Golf from being part of the golf scene.\n\nThe only thing left is to accept them and start negotiating with them, aiming for a brighter future for the fans of this sport. It's difficult to look at things from a positive perspective now that there is more conflict than ever, not only between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf but also between golfers on the same Tours. LIV Golf has disrupted many things, but the merger could also fix many things. We'll have to wait and see what happens.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sead_dedovic@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Sead Dedovic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Dunne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Dunne"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image148521.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: David Yeazell-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAhead of the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship, Webb Simpson addressed a variety of questions in a pre-tournament press conference. The American professional golfer first shared his experience as a member of the Quail Hollow Club. He revealed that he joined the club back in 2011 and talked about how things have changed since then.\n\nSimpson proceeded to mention that he relocated to the golf course in 2014 and has also made use of all the facilities offered. He was overjoyed to be at the golf course and to be one of the select few players who have competed in both a major tournament and a regular tour event at their home golf course. The golfer received an invitation to participate in the upcoming tournament at Quail Hollow via a fourth sponsor's exemption for the season.\n\nWith the event starting in just a few hours, Simpson also discussed the current challenges of the golf course. He noted that the greens are only a year old, making them somewhat firm and challenging to play on. He hoped that the weather conditions wouldn't be much of a hassle for the players competing.\n\nWhen questioned about Rory McIlroy stepping down from the PGA Tour policy board, the seven-time PGA Tour champion acknowledged the complexity of the current situation within the PGA Tour. And that he knows that McIlroy would go out of his way to help with the discussions and the board choices.\n\nHe proceeded to reflect on the numerous changes that he has witnessed in the sport during his tenure as a Player Director on the board.\n\nIn light of the ongoing merger talks, Webb Simpson acknowledged that after some players had left the tour to join LIV Golf, there is now a concerted effort to determine how both circuits will collaborate and evolve in the future. The team at the PGA Tour was working tirelessly to get around these obstacles, and Webb was optimistic that the tour would come up with a workaround soon.\n\nDuring the discussion, the moderator revisited the topic of McIlroy, questioning why he felt there might be some discomfort among board members regarding his return. In response, Webb Simpson clarified that that wasn't the case. Instead, the board was actively working to determine where the four-time major winner's role could be most effectively utilized. He emphasized that the board indeed wants the 32-year-old golfer's involvement and sees him as a valuable asset in moving forward.\n\nSince McIlory is not joining the board now, Webb Simpson will be continuing his term as a Player Director on the PGA Tour policy board. The duo are also expected to tee off at the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship, scheduled to take place from May 9 to May 12, 2024.\n\nWhile the merger talks are finalized, the future of the Saudi-backed tour hangs in the balance, and so does the chance of LIV golfers competing in the majors and the Ryder Cup.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alisha_kotadia@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Alisha Kotadia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_golfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional golfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/03/fba09ce0-webb-simpson.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 2798, "textEnd": 2803}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-05-", "textStart": 2807, "textEnd": 2813}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

He and Shane Lowry, who convinced him to sign up in the first place, ended up winning after a comeback and playoff.\n\nTheir win propelled Lowry into the field of some upcoming Signature Events, which are PGA Tour tournaments that carry a pretty large prize purse, so the win was advantageous from that perspective and more for the duo. Rory McIlroy said via Talksport:\n\n\"It got us both up the FedEx Cup points list quite a bit. And it gave us a lot of confidence going into the meat of the season and the summer. So, yeah, it was a great week. I'm so glad that we were able to do it and play, and, yeah, it definitely makes me excited about the rest of the year now.\"\n\nExcitement might be something McIlroy hasn't had lately. He hadn't won a PGA Tour event all year until then, and he came up short once again in his bid to complete a career Grand Slam. Moving forward, McIlroy may be renewed and have more energy to compete.\n\nRory McIlroy had a positive experience at the Zurich Classic\n\nRory McIlroy had been winless in 2024 up until the Zurich Classic, a rarity for the golfer. He hadn't exactly come all that close, either. He finally broke through with Lowry at his side and it invigorated him.\n\nWith still more than a few months left this season, McIlroy said the win infused him with some much-needed fun and excitement. He said via Talksport:\n\n\"The week in New Orleans did me the world of good just in terms of the fun element. It was a lot of fun; we had a great time, regardless of the result.\"\n\nNaturally, the win felt better. He called their win over Martin Trainer and Chad Ramey a \"bonus\" and added that winning with a friend like Lowry was good too. McIlroy said that he felt great about his game as well.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_roberts@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Zachary Roberts", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Lowry_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shane Lowry (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich_Classic_of_New_Orleans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zurich Classic of New Orleans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FedEx Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talksport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Talksport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Ramey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chad Ramey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Trainer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martin Trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Classical_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Classical Studies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Classical_Studies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Classical Studies/Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Classical_Studies/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Classical Studies/Academic Departments", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/bebce-17151886802197-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.584313725490196, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

The deal has been in talks since it was announced in June 2023.\n\nRory McIlroy was one of the PGA Tour Players' Directors earlier. However, he resigned from the position in November 2023. It was reported that he would probably replace Webb Simpson on the board soon.\n\nNonetheless, McIlroy failed to earn the support of all the players' directors and will not return to the position. Currently, Tiger Woods, Jordan Spieth, Patrick Cantlay, Peter Malnati, Webb Simpson, and Adam Scott serve as the PGA Tour Players Directors, and out of all of them, only Woods will reportedly initiate further talks with PIF.\n\nMonahan provided an update on the negotiation deal, saying they \"are making progress\" and also about McIlroy's return. He said (via Sportstar):\n\n\"Today's news is in no way a commentary on Rory's important perspective and influence. It's simply a matter of adherence to our governance process by which a tour player becomes a board member.\n\n\"Webb remaining in his position as a member of the policy board and PGA Tour Enterprises board through the end of his term provides the continuity needed at this vital time. We are making progress in our negotiations with the PIF,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, next week, PGA Tour players and LIV golfers will compete at the PGA Championship 2024.

Pga Memorial Tournament Round 3\n\nPro golfer Rory McIlroy has been one of the main PGA Tour voices speaking out against LIV Golf. He, along with Tiger Woods, has been the main steady force that has helped to keep the tour afloat despite being offered millions to jump ship.\n\nThe pair have been rewarded for their loyalty. However, Mcllroy has stepped back as PGA spokesman in recent months and has even decided not to be part of the PGA Tour board and stepped down.\n\nNow, he wants back in but some board members don't want him to rejoin the board. This appears to be because he has taken a softened stance against LIV Golf, which has turned some board members off.\n\n\"There's been a lot of conversations. Sort of reminded me partly why I didn't [stay on the board in the first place],\" he said, per Golf Digest. \"I think it just, it got pretty complicated and pretty messy and I think with the way it happened, I think it opened up some old wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before ... there was a subset of people on the board that were maybe uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason. \"I think the best course of action is if, you know, there's some people on there that aren't comfortable with me coming back on, then I think Webb (Simpson) just stays on and sees out his term, and I think he's gotten to a place where he's comfortable with doing that and I just sort of keep doing what I'm doing.\"\n\nAlthough he volunteered to help and was rejected, Mcllroy says there were no hard feelings.\n\n\"I put my hand up to help and it was ... I wouldn't say it was rejected, it was a complicated process to get through to put me back on there. So that's all fine, no hard feelings and we'll all move on,\" Mcllroy said.\n\nWebb Simpson seems to be the person leading the way to try and put McIlroy back on the board, but detractors include Patrick Cantlay.\n\nYou have to wonder if is it a mistake in not to let one of the world's best golfers and a huge advocate for the PGA Tour not back on the board. It could open the door for LIV Golf to make a serious run at him again. Mcllroy seems to be steadfast in his loyalty to the PGA but that all could be tested.\n\nHe seems to be leaning more and more into this merger with LIV Golf. Even though it might won't happen, it also may not be a shock if Mcllroy decides to eventually shift allegiances if the wind blows the right way.

It's hard to keep that positive mindset, week in, week out.\n\n\"That was my fourth week in a row, and I was saying to my team last week, it's a great lesson for me that when things aren't going great, sometimes it's not about going back home and working on your game and standing on the range.\n\n\"It's about trying to play, and play through it and understand what your misses are and how to manage.\n\n\"It was a good lesson to me that sometimes just to keep going is the right thing to do, and to keep playing and to keep working on what you're working on and having faith that it is all going to come together at some point.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishmirror.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_abbott@irishmirror.ie", "name": "Matthew Abbott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich_Classic_of_New_Orleans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zurich Classic of New Orleans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Lowry_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shane Lowry (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_of_Louisiana", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TPC of Louisiana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FedEx Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article32761342.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_MIRROR-UK-Rory-McIlroy-was-struggling-to-have-fun-on-PGA-Tour-until-being-taught-great-lesson.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549930", "eventUri": "eng-9549930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6627450980392158, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

The anonymous director told GolfWeek: \"We need Rory back on the board. Had he stayed on he could've neutered Cantlay. He's the only one with the power to neuter Cantlay. We need Rory to try to keep Cantlay from ruining the Tour.\"\n\nThe source continued: \"Rory wants the Irish Open and other international events to be promoted and smaller fields and larger purses. There's a lot we don't like about Rory and his deal. But the main thing is Cantlay and we've got to get a deal done with the PIF. LIV's got to go away. If we don't get a deal done, we're all screwed in the end. We all know it. (Cantlay) is against it. Rory is for it. So let's get a deal done and get these (guys) put to bed.\n\n\"Do any of us want to work with the Saudis? No. But, on the other hand, none of us want to fight against them and their money for the rest of our careers, either. Cantlay is blocking any type of deal they try to put together.\"\n\nHowever McIlroy has confirmed he won't be joining. He sensed that some existing members would be uncomfortable with his presence and he wasn't happy with the way things went.\n\nHe said: \"It just got pretty complicated and pretty messy. With the way it happened it opened up some wounds and scar tissue from things that have happened before. And I think there was a subset of people on the board who were uncomfortable with me coming back on for some reason.\"\n\nFollow Record Sport on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram for all of the up-to-the minute breaking news, video and audio on the SPFL, the Scotland national team and beyond.\n\nYou can also follow our dedicated Rangers and Celtic podcast pages and sign up to our newsletters to make sure you never miss a beat throughout the season.

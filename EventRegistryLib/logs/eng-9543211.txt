While the BJP's mantra was \"development, the YSRCP's government's mantra was 'corruption,' he added.\n\nReferring to the delay in Central Projects, Modi said the State Government was not forthcoming in allocating land for head office of the South Coastal Railway Zone in Visakhapatnam.\n\nModi's criticism of YSRCP, first such tirade in the campaign so far, is significant, as BJP is seen as being 'soft' on the YSRCP so far. Though a shift in the stance could be seen now, it is noteworthy that the Prime Minister avoided any direct reference to Chief Minister and YSRCP President YS Jagan Mohan Reddy in his speeches today.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on May 6, 2024", "source": {"uri": "thehindubusinessline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "@businessline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YSR_Congress_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "YSR Congress Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_Desam_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Telugu Desam Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajahmundry", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajahmundry"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rajahmundry"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polavaram_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polavaram Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._Chandrababu_Naidu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "N.

But the YSRCP government derailed all that progress. Instead of working for the welfare of the people, the YSRCP drowned the state in debt,\" he said.\n\nHe said there was booming young talent in Andhra Pradesh, whose mettle had been recognised worldwide. \"But under the YSRCP regime, it is just a dream, as the government had done zero in development, but promoted 100% corruption.\n\n\"The projects sanctioned by the central government have been delayed multiple times, only further derailing the welfare of the people,\" he said, and assured that with the double engine government of the NDA, all projects which had been left incomplete, shall be completed.\n\nAsking the people to be wary of the Congress, Modi said the country under its regime 10 years ago was associated with scams. \"The Congress and I.N.D.I.A leaders often fume at ED (Enforcement Directorate). You know why? In Jharkhand, mountains of currency bundles have been recovered from the servant of the personal secretary of one of the Congress leaders,\" he said.\n\nHe said the Congress had turned the homes of servants into an abode of black money so much that cash counting machines too got tired of counting the notes. All those who were caught with unaccounted cash were close to the first family of the Congress, he alleged. \"When Modi holds them accountable for their crimes, they hurl abuses at him. But Modi doesn't care about these bad words, he only cares about the poor,\" he said.\n\nModi said as of now ED has caught hold of only \u20b91.15 lakh crore worth property, but it would be much more, and he was consulting experts to unearth them.\n\n\"Modi has already returned \u20b917 lakh crore which was stolen from the poor in the past. No poor individual shall be left cheated. That is Modi's guarantee,\" he said.\n\nModi alleged that in Andhra Pradesh, too, the YSRCP was running in full speed towards corruption. \"These people came into power making false promises of a ban on liquor and the same people in the government are today actively involved in the liquor business. Andhra Pradesh today finds itself in the middle of a very big alcohol syndicate and the state is being governed by the sand and liquor mafia,\" he said.\n\nTaking a dig at Jagan's ambitious plan of creating three capitals for the state, Modi said in the last five years, they couldn't come up even with one capital. \"The idea of three capitals was only to mask their plans of big corruption. The YSRCP government is only capable of managing corruption, not a state's finances,\" he said.\n\nHe also accused the YSRCP government of neglecting the Polavaram project, the lifeline of AP, though the Centre had allotted \u20b915,000 crore for the same. The farmers are suffering due to lack of proper irrigation and are not getting remunerative prices for their agriculture produce, he said.\n\nModi explained how the Centre had launched various initiatives to develop Andhra, like Amaravati-Vijayawada road project, Visakhapatnam-Chennai industrial corridor, expansion of Rajahmundry airport and a south coast railway zone Visakhapatnam, among others.\n\nThe elections to the state assembly and Lok Sabha in Andhra Pradesh are scheduled to be held on May 13.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YSR_Congress_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "YSR Congress Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vemagiri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vemagiri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vemagiri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._Chandrababu_Naidu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "N.

Article 370 was abolished because of Modi. Terrorists are unable to enter the country under his reign,\" Pawan Kalyan said in an election rally here.\n\nJana Sena Party, TDP and BJP are allies in Andhra Pradesh and they are pitted against ruling YSRCP in the coming Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in the state.\n\nHe alleged that the YSRCP government led by Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is indulging in massive corruption and claimed that it can be stopped only by Prime Minister Modi.\n\n\"Union government schemes are being renamed by YS Jagan. Welfare and development are only possible under the leadership of Modi. Andhra Pradesh is the land of poets and writers. We need the blessings of Modi. Wherever we look in the state, YSRCP is looting land and sand. It will be stopped by PM Modi only,\" he added.\n\nPraising PM Modi, the actor-turned-politician said that only PM Modi can bring India to the top of the world.\n\n\"After May 13, a new era will be set up in Andhra Pradesh. Andhra Pradesh will turn into Vikasit Andhra. I believe that the NDA will form the government in the upcoming polls,\" he said.\n\nComing down heavily on the YSRCP government, Pawan Kalyan said that no development work has been done under Jagan Reddy's rule.\n\n\"We have two problems in the state: Congress and the YSR Congress Party. Congress leaders have already accepted their failure, and YSRCP has yet to acknowledge it. In the span of five years, no development has been seen in the state. Andhra Pradesh was at the top during Chandrababu Naidu's regime. After the YSRCP assumed power, the state declined. No development or welfare has been seen in the state. All development and welfare are only possible with PM Modi. The development score is zero, and corruption has reached 100% in the state,\" he said.\n\nThe Assembly and Lok Sabha elections in Andhra Pradesh will be held on May 13.\n\nIn the 2019 Assembly elections, the YSRCP won with a thumping majority of 151 seats, while the TDP was confined to 23 seats. In the Lok Sabha polls, the YSRCP won 22 seats, while the TDP could only win three seats.

Dubbing the YSRCP and the Congress as two dangers to the State, he said the former had wasted the last five years and pushed A.P. into a debt trap. \"The people of Andhra have completely rejected the YSRCP and the Congress has already conceded defeat before the results,\" he said.\n\nHe explained how the Polavaram project was halted by the YSRCP government despite thousands of crores of rupees sanction by the Centre.\n\n\"There is zero work and 100% corruption in A.P. The YSRCP talked about total prohibition but it is selling liquor. A big syndicate is going on in the name of liquor and sand business. The government talked about three capitals but before one capital is built, the exchequer is empty. They can only manage corruption and can't manage finances,\" Mr. Modi said.\n\nCriticising the INDI Alliance, the PM said that heaps of cash was recovered from the domestic help of Jharkhand Minister's PA. \"This was not the first time, bigger money was found from a Congress MP's residence,\" he said.\n\nLaw on corrupt money\n\nSpeaking about the recovery of corrupt money, Mr. Modi said, \"We are discussing with legal officials to bring out a law to recover the corrupt money and distribute it among the poor. When Modi catches black money, they blame ED or call me names. But my focus is to ensure the welfare and rights of the poor.\"\n\nHailing A.P., its young talent and entrepreneurship, he said the people should stay away from the negativity of the Congress and the YSRCP and vote for the NDA Alliance.\n\nMr. Modi also dwelt on a bunch of ongoing Central projects such as highway and national corridor road projects, Kakinada port connectivity and their possible contribution to overall development of the State.\n\nMr. Pawan Kalyan, who spoke before Mr. Modi, lauded the latter for his efforts for repeal of Art. 370, impartial distribution of Padma awards and enhancing the image of India on international fora. \"We need to vote for the NDA Alliance for Viksit Bharat and Viksit A.P.,\" Mr. Kalyan said.\n\nMs. Purandeswari asked people to vote for the NDA Alliance to ensure development and a corruption-free society. \"I'm lucky to be contesting as the BJP candidate from Rajahmundry. I hope that you all support the people contesting in other constituencies too representing the Alliance,\" she said.\n\nMr. Lokesh said Amaravati would be the single capital for A.P. \"Viksit Bharat

He was warmly welcomed by his NDA allies -TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu and his son Nara Lokesh as well as Jana Sena leader Pawan Kalyan.\n\nAttacking the Congress Mr Modi said \"In Jharkhand the ED have dug out a mountain of currency notes. This from the house of the servant of the PA who works for a Congress minister. Just think Congress has made the servant's house a warehouse of their black money. This is not the first time. Earlier their MP was also caught.\"\n\n\"Why is it that the first family of the Congress (Gandhis) are close to people from whom such a huge amount of notes were recovered? Was the money kept aside to be supplied elsewhere? Has the first family of Congress set up such godowns across the country? The nation wants to know from Shahzade of Congress,\" said Mr Modi.\n\n\"Modi is seeking legal advice... All those who have been looted, we will see how the money can be returned to them. Modi has already returned Rs17,000 crore to those who had a right to it. No poor will be looted - this is Modi's guarantee\" said the Prime Minister before launching a stringent attack on the YSRCP.\n\nHe said the ruling party had completely derailed development in AP. The Prime Minister said \"When there is no intention to serve the public the results are seldom achieved. By stalling the Polavaram project they have put brakes on the lifeline of Andhra Pradesh.\" He also accused the ruling YSRCP of failing to set up even one capital city in the past five years. He said the YSRCP supremo had failed to even complete the projects started by his father although he had usurped YSR's political legacy.\n\n\"YSR Congress had said they will set up three capitals in AP. But in these years they were unable to set up even one. They were planning to make a huge loot in the name of three capitals but before that state exchequer was emptied out. They can only manage corruption, financial management is not their cup of tea,\" said Mr Modi.\n\nHe went on to add that just like Karnataka where he alleged land and tanker mafia were running the government, in AP it was the sand, land and liquor mafia which were running the government. He urged the people of AP to vote for NDA keeping in mind Modi's guarantee, Chandrababu Naidu's leadership and their faith in Pawan Kalyan.", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Statesman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jharkhand"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jharkhand"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nara_Lokesh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nara Lokesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YSR_Congress_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YSR Congress Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_Desam_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telugu Desam Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajahmundry", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajahmundry"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rajahmundry"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawan_Kalyan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pawan Kalyan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._Chandrababu_Naidu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "N.

However, despite his leaders, such as Anakapalli MP candidate C.M. Ramesh and Rajahmundry MP candidate D. Purandeswari, stating that the privatisation has been stopped, he chose not to speak about the emotive issue.\n\nWe expected the Prime Minister to make an announcement on the VSP privatisation issue, but his silence over the matter was a disappointment, said the employees of VSP, who attended the public meeting in large numbers.\n\nThe Prime Minister was in the State to take part in the campaign for BJP candidates C.M. Ramesh and D. Purandeswari, contesting from Anakapalli and Rajahmahendravaram Lok Sabha constituencies, respectively.\n\nEarlier in the day he attended a public meeting in Rajamahendravaram where he sought votes from public in favour of BJP State president D. Purandeswari.\n\nGoing all guns blazing against Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, Mr. Modi said that the Union government has sanctioned over 24 lakh houses for the poor under the 'PM Awas Yojana', but the State government has not completed and released at least half of the houses.\n\nMr. Modi also said that the Union government has sanctioned \u20b91,500 crore for the 'Uttarandhra Sujala Sravanthi' irrigation project, but the State Government has failed to complete it.\n\n\"Jagan's father, Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, initiated the project. However, Jagan appears to have inherited his father's political legacy, but not his political will to complete the projects,\" said Mr. Modi.\n\nThe Prime Minister also reminded the swelling audience that Anakapalli was once the hub for sugarcane farming, but now, the farmers are suffering, and most of the sugar mills are closed.\n\nHe assured the farmers that once NDA comes to power both in the Centre and the State, the sugarcane farmers will see a brighter day, as the production will increase and ethanol will now be added to other fuels. This will uplift the region and there will be employment generation, he said.\n\nHe also reminded that 'Kisan Credit' has already been extended to fishermen, and the NDA plans to develop a fish processing culture in Andhra Pradesh to boost the economy.\n\nTalking about Viksit Bharat and Viksit Andhra, Mr. Modi said that the State needs double-engine growth to wriggle out of corruption and debts.\n\n\"Earlier, in 2014, A.P. had only 400 km of National Highway. Today, it has gone up to 9,000 km; and the six-lane road from Anakapalli to Anandapuram and the Raipur-Visakhapatnam corridor will boost the economy of the region. The green energy project at Pudimadaka and bulk drug facility at Nakkapalli, are a few steps towards development,\" he pointed out.\n\nAll the alliance MP and MLA candidates from north coastal Andhra Pradesh, TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu, Naga Babu of JSP and senior BJP, TDP and JSP leaders were present.\n\nMr. Modi left the venue immediately after his speech, excusing himself and saying he had to reach Gandhinagar for his election on May 7, (Tuesday).

Chandrabau Naidu has exhorted the voters to exercise their franchise in favour of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).\n\nAddressing a public meeting at Anakapalli near Visakhapatnam on May 6 (Monday), Mr. Naidu expressed confidence that the NDA would win 160 of the 175 Assembly seats in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nReferring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement made earlier at the meeting, the TDP chief said that the 'double engine sarkar' would take India from the present fifth place to the thrid in the World GDP rankings in the next five years.\n\nMr. Naidu said that his and JSP president K. Pawan Kalyan's dream was to achieve 'Vikasit Andhra Pradesh' by 2047. \"The NDA, if elected to power, will check crimes, build capital at Amaravati, complete the Polavaram and Uttarandhra Sujala Sravanthi projects, apart from protecting the Telugu language and culture,\" he said.\n\nMr. Naidu ridiculed Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy over the A.P. Land Titling Act and for the land documents carrying the photo of the Chief Minister. Describing the YSRCP leaders as the \"traitors of North Andhra\", he alleged that YSRCP had looted Visakhapatnam.\n\nThe activists of TDP, JSP and BJP during the Praja Galam meeting at Ugginapalem in Anakapalli district on May 6, 2024 | Photo Credit: V.

Ayyanna Patrudu, Bandaru Satyanarayana Murthy and Pratibha Bharathi, while the YSRCP thrust outsiders such as V. Vijaya Sai Reddy and Y.V. Subba Reddy upon the region.\n\nMr. Naidu reiterated the promises on a 'Mega DSC', issuing job calendars and creation of 20 lakh jobs in five years.\n\nDescribing the elections as a battle between 'dharmam' and 'adharmam' (justice and injustice), Mr. Naidu introduced the NDA candidates from north Andhra to the crowd.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YSR_Congress_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "YSR Congress Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_Desam_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Telugu Desam Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Andhra", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Andhra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anakapalli_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anakapalli district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jana_Sena_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jana Sena Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visakhapatnam", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Visakhapatnam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Visakhapatnam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y._S._Jagan_Mohan_Reddy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Y.

Some Indian maps show that the State has no capital, allege TDP leaders. Ongole MP Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy, who recently left YSRCP and joined the TDP, in an interaction with The Hindu, said: \"Everybody is expecting that NDA, headed by N. Chandrababu Naidu, will form the next government in Andhra Pradesh. People of the State are unhappy about the rising prices under the YSRCP rule and they are looking towards better administration.\" \"Over the last five years, A.P.'s financial situation has become horrible. Only Chandrababu Naidu can revive the State in this condition. He can take up development activities without borrowing more money. The alliance government will complete all the projects that were held up for a long time. The new government will also control the price rise in the future,\" he said. Masses gather whenever the alliance parties organize a road show or public meeting in AP. Even during high temperatures, there was heavy turnout. Thousands of people stood in the hot sun to listen to the speeches of Naidu and Jana Sena Chief Pawan Kalyan. This clearly shows that the people want the NDA to form government in the State. Thrashing the allegations of no unity among the parties in NDA, Sreenivasulu Reddy says: \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has come to A.P. to campaign for the alliance. Pawan Kalyan has also been co-operating with Telugu Desam cadres. He spoke for one hour recently at Giddalur facing the heat of 44 degrees Celsius.\" Expressing similar views, former Union Minister and TDP leader Panabaka Lakshmi said, \"People are expecting change. The State needs a visionary and experienced leader like Chandrababu Niadu. He has plans to uplift the poor, unemployed youth and farmers.\" \"Our manifesto has given more priority to women. It offers free bus travel to all women in the State and a monthly pension for all needy women. Every mother will get \u20b915,000 per annum under the 'Talliki Vandanam' scheme and three gas cylinders per household under the Deepam scheme. DWCRA women will get interest-free loans up to \u20b910 lakh,\" she said. The manifesto also announced 20 lakh jobs for youth or \u20b93,000 monthly unemployment aid. It assured a tap water connection to every house, particularly in the Rayalaseema region where women are facing a severe water crisis. However, the manifesto did not mention about 4 per cent reservation for Muslims, as announced by the former Chief Minister. When asked about the decision of the alliance, Lakshmi said: \"Union Home Minister Amit Shah has clearly announced that they have no plans to remove the 4 per cent reservation for Muslim minorities in AP. The BJP leaders are cooperating with the State for the welfare of all castes and religions in the State. The alliance will see good turnout and get succeeded in the elections.\" She further alleged that the people of AP will teach a lesson to Jagan for throwing the State into bankruptcy. However, the YSRCP supremo claims huge development and several investments in the State during his term as Chief Minister. In a recent public meeting at Nellore, he said: \"AP has received investments worth more than \u20b91 lakh crore during last five years, while it had seen only Rs 32,000 crore investments during the TDP rule.\"\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YSR_Congress_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "YSR Congress Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._Chandrababu_Naidu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "N.

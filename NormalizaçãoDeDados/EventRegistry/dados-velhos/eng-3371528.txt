Kagame won another term after the government disqualified all but three candidates. (Associated Press)\n\nRwandan President Paul Kagame is being inaugurated Friday after winning re-election with nearly 99 percent of the vote.\n\nMany African leaders are expected to attend the ceremony in Kigali, the capital.\n\nThe longtime president had described the Aug. 4 election as \"a formality\" while campaigning.\n\nThe East African nation has virtually no political opposition, and critics accuse Kagame of being intolerant of dissent. He denies it.\n\nKagame has been de facto leader or president since the end of the 1994 genocide. Because of a change to the constitution in 2015, he can legally stay in power until 2034.\n\nA Human Rights Watch statement says Rwanda's election \"took place in a context of very limited free speech or open political space.\"\n\nAmnesty International had described a \"climate of fear\" ahead of the vote.\n\nThe Rwandan election is just the latest example of a history of apparently rigged elections in Africa. Countries throughout the continent have had rulers and presidents that seemingly stay in power for an eternity.\n\nThe most well-known example is President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, who has been in power for over 30 years and is regarded as one of the world's most controversial leaders. Originally praised as revolutionary hero who helped free his country from British colonialism, he has been accused of being a dictator responsible for economic mismanagement and widespread political corruption.\n\nMugabe's regime has perpetrated anti-white racial discrimination, human right abuses, suppression of political critics and crimes against humanity. He has also been accused of election rigging as recently as 2013, when his party won a landslide victory with 61 percent of the vote.\n\nAs recently as last week, elections were also questioned in Kenya, where opposition leader Raila Odinga refused to accept the results of the presidential campaign.\n\nOdinga claimed the election was rigged in favor of incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta and did not trust the paper forms, saying they could have been \"manipulated already.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, he vowed to take his challenge of the election to Kenya's Supreme Court.\n\n\"This is just the beginning,\" he said at a news conference. \"We will not accept and move on.\"\n\n\"No one should believe -- and especially not those behind this election fraud -- that Kenyans are sheep who will willingly go along with the democracy's slaughter. This country is now divided between those prepared to live under autocracy and the forces of freedom and democracy.\"", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100, "id": 276, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "wgt": 100, "id": 301, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "type": "loc", "id": "114"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Rwanda"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Rwanda"}, "type": "loc", "id": "192"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}, "type": "loc", "id": "249"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Rwanda"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kigali"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kigali", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kigali"}, "type": "loc", "id": "6538"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302948", "label": {"eng": "Politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303023", "label": {"eng": "Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303232", "label": {"eng": "Election"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303539"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304262", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304336", "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304589", "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "304754", "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305156", "label": {"eng": "Ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305776", "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306436", "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306866", "label": {"eng": "Amnesty International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raila_Odinga", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "307980", "label": {"eng": "Raila Odinga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaramogi_Oginga_Odinga", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "307981", "label": {"eng": "Jaramogi Oginga Odinga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uhuru_Kenyatta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "308046", "label": {"eng": "Uhuru Kenyatta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_landslide_victories", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "308275", "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "309536", "label": {"eng": "Human Rights Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310802", "label": {"eng": "Crimes against humanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kagame", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "317012", "label": {"eng": "Paul Kagame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "319469", "label": {"eng": "De facto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "320635", "label": {"eng": "Robert Mugabe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "322425", "label": {"eng": "Hate crime"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Empire"}, "type": "loc", "id": "341235"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "356715", "label": {"eng": "Rwandan Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_Rwanda", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "543752", "label": {"eng": "List of Presidents of Rwanda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1083325", "label": {"eng": "Race (human categorization)"}}]}

Rwanda is back again to its ruthless and bloody totalitarianism slavery, autocratic suppression and royal oppression of the majority of the population of Rwanda under Paul Kagame the King, absolute ruler.\n\nSome signs for this deplorable shift started coming out strongly when Paul Kagame changed the constitution of the Republic of Rwanda overnight on 18/12/2015 in a harsh and rushing way, as if he was running away from something terrible or for his own life! Then when Kagame Paul woke up again and on 31/12/2015, decided to officially and shamelessly declare that he is not ready to leave power in peace and democratically in Rwanda, I had no doubt that what I am saying is soon to be realized. The \"Nollywood\" Rwanda Presidential elections that he organized unnecessarily on 04/08/2017 where he again run alone as \"a single player, a couch in the football match and as a referee himself of the same game, and as the game official, and as the one to decide how many goals he should score in a goal-post without a goal keeper\", and after silencing all potential candidates who could democratically and competitively challenge him like Diane Rwigara and Gilbert Mwenedata.\n\nOne has also to remember a chain of political leaders who are languish in prisons in Rwanda, because they all dared from time to time to try and challenge democratically in competitive and peaceful elections with this brutal authoritarian and totalitarian of the century, then again one has only to confirm my observation that Rwanda is no longer to be existing as a \"Republic.\" But as a \"monastic dynasty\". Everything that happened during the so called presidential elections many people including the so called allies of the serial killer Paul Kagame saw it as more coronation than being election since Kagame Paul had finally decided ruthlessly and brutally being alone and he had no other way to show it publicly and officially apart from doing it like in a North Korea military parade. Then finally I said bye bye with \"Rwanda being A republic\" and welcome to the monarchy.\n\nDuring all his elections shows again Paul Kagame never told Rwandan people what he will do for them but rather he was telling how he will be on power endlessly they want it or not who were being forced by security services to attend his rallies, then again I said it true Paul Kagame is preparing the people of Rwanda to forget about democratic rule but should be ready to go back to slavery of royal kingship. Rwanda liver under the subjection of a traditional royal dynasty and monarchy more than 400 years until 1950s when the people of Rwanda massively rejected this slavery and suppression of the Kings.\n\nKagame Paul wanted to show that with 99 % votes he has to bring this suppression in a massive way. The way you rejected slavery it's the way I have to use to bring it back on you, by fire by force. And \"When Paul Kagame was suspected strongly that he allegedly planned to kill in USA the last king of Rwanda Kigeli V Ndahirdurwa, when he had blocked him from going back to Rwanda when he was still alive but rather he decided to bring him back to his country which he loved so much in his dead body, I saw another sign of what will happen on 18/08/2017. This is was to allow Paul Kagame to clear all his obstacles of making himself a King of Rwanda.\n\nAgain it was clear that to me that Kagame Paul is soon the king of Rwanda. When Kagame Paul seemingly forbad a honorary and state funeral to the last king of Rwanda for real, it was an another proof that new King of Rwanda Paul Kagame is warming up in background. The date of 18/08/2017 is refutably a crowning ceremony day of Kagame Paul as monarchical ruler. 99% was just a symbol to reminder that in monarch there only one King who have to command everything. 99% proves that Kagame Paul is soon to be absolute ruler, who will not tolerate any other alternative as long he is alive in Rwanda. There has never been any room for freedom and democracy in Rwanda it no need to think that it is now coming when the new King is being crowned. Under absolute monarchy everything belongs to the king. Kagame Paul has grabbed almost every fields and farms, all businesses and houses from Rwanda people and he has made them all his personal properties.\n\nNow those who have got beautiful wives and cute daughters have to be ready to start handing them to the new king, since it is the only thing he had not yet started doing over his 23 years of reign and which was being done in Rwanda by the traditionally kings. And I hope that Kagame Paul has remembered to consult the King of Swaziland and that he has invited him in his official and public coronation ceremonies and finally that they will soon be good friends because of the same matter. \"All the beautiful wives and cute daughters belong to the king in absolute monarchy\" regardless of it being right or wrong good or bad!\n\nWhat remains is now to convince all African leaders and members of African union AU to start bowing before him from 18/8/2017 and he will finally become an emperor, King of Kings of AU starting from next years. These are Reasons why Paul Kagame has been wanting to conquer RDC through endless military invasions and looting of natural resources and selling them illegally abroad. He has tried to destabilize Burundi. Some Countries are now awaiting to be influenced by Paul Kagame to follow in his footsteps to make their countries no- go- Area for democracy and freedom.\n\nRemember who are hi best friends? King of Morocco, King of Saud Arabia, Qatar and Oman. Rwanda people and the friends of Rwanda will remember this message and the dates I have mentioned and the sequence of events as I explained- Finally, all the speeches of Paul Kagame was saying that he is not interested in continuing being a President. :\" Come 2017, I will not be there as a PRESIDENT...

Your love of learning can be infectious and inspiring to any student you teach. Remember how you nurture the courage in a pupil's heart. You are a tutor, an enabler, and a caregiver combined, and you can -- and will -- make a difference, writes Lebanese artist and writer Kahlil Gibran in his book, The Prophet, in reference to a teacher's role.\n\nEducators, on the other hand, say their greatest reward is when their students become influential members of society. And indeed, that is the one thing that elates veteran teacher Augustin Nyabutsitsi today. The 74-year-old taught President Paul Kagame in primary six and seven between 1967 and 1968.\n\nNyabutsitsi, who currently teaches at Le Bon Berger school in Kimironko, Kigali, vividly recalls that he tutored President Kagame at Rwengoro Primary school, which was located in Gahunge refugee camp in Uganda, where he too was also exiled.\n\nWith over 50 years experience in the classroom, he says he remembers most of his former students.\n\n\"Kagame was like other children, but he was exceptionally intelligent. His favourite subjects were mathematics and English. He was also very curious, and I remember he would not stop asking questions until he felt satisfied,\" says Nyabutsitsi, adding that the school records can actually confirm that he always topped his class.\n\nNyabutsitsi also recalls that like most of his contemporaries at the time, Kagame's favourite sport was football, which they played using balls made from dry banana leaves.\n\nKagame remembers his teacher\n\nNyabutsitsi says greater fulfillment, however, comes not when your former student has made it big in life, but when they are able to remember and appreciate the teachers who molded them.\n\nNyabutsitsi admits that for years he harboured a strong wish to meet in person his former student President Kagame, but little did he know that the President had also been on a similar mission.\n\n\"This continued until one day when President Kagame was in a meeting in Nyagatare, where he asked those in attendance if by chance anyone knew where his former primary teacher Augustin Nyabutsitsi lived,\" he says.\n\nFrom that time, the President tasked Prof. Manasseh Nshuti to locate Nyabutsitsi. The former student and teacher finally met on January 25, 2016.\n\nNyabutsitsi now lives In Kinyinya Sector in Gasabo District in a modern village known as \"Kwa Dubai\". He stays in a decent 4-bedroom house which was donated to him by President Kagame.\n\n\"When we met, I didn't ask for anything from him, but I was surprised that he knew almost everything about me. He told me he had heard I was renting after which he tasked Prof. Nshuti to get me a decent house. This is what you see today; it's feedback from him. I never dreamed of owning a house like this, and take this opportunity to thank him sincerely,\" says Nyabutsitsi with a beaming face.\n\nHe says many people come to pay him a visit and take a look at a house he has been gifted by President Kagame.\n\nTeddy Kawera, 60, Nyabutsitsi's sister and a teacher at Wellspring Academy, Kigali, says the house they received from President Kagame was a miracle.\n\n\"We used to rent a three-bedroom house in Kanombe for Rwf150,000. We are now happy and we sleep peacefully without worrying about monthly rent fees. We are more secure and at peace, thanks to the President,\" says Kawera.\n\nProud teacher\n\nNyabutsitsi says he is proud that some of his former students have become influential persons in the country.\n\n\"I feel I've been useful to the country. There are many other top officials and soldiers who sat before me in class when we were in exile. Some of these include Joseph Mugambage, who works with the Presidency, Major Rugira and Alexis Kagame, among others. The list is indeed long, with President Kagame on top,\" says Nyabutsitsi.\n\nWith 50 years in the trade, Nyabutsitsi says he has always been driven by passion to teach Rwandan children.\n\n\"Nothing brings me greater joy than seeing someone I taught become an important person later,\" he says.\n\nA lesson to other teachers\n\nNyabutsitsi says teachers' working environment is not the best, but it is their duty profession and love for students above everything else.\n\n\"My advice to my fellow teachers is to love our profession and students unconditionally. When students feel loved, they love us in return and remember us forever.

He has conveniently forgotten that the civil wars of 1959 and 1990s were about the exclusion of whole ethnic groups from state power. The dream of freedom and peace remains distant for Rwandans.\n\nOn 4 August 2017 President Paul Kagame had himself \"elected\" a life-president through the so-called elections in which he scored a perfect vote of 99%, earning himself a permanent place alongside Joseph Stalin, Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong Un and many other dictators, dead or alive. The costly and sham elections were preceded by the so-called referendum to change the constitution, allowing him to be president until 2034.\n\nThe results of the just concluded costly electoral exercise have not come as a surprise to Paul Kagame, Rwandans and other interested observers of Rwandan politics. On 14 July 2017, President Kagame publicly declared that everyone knows the outcome of the elections. Nevertheless, he imposed useless elections that cost impoverished Rwandan taxpayers five billion Rwanda Francs.\n\nTo justify his one-man-as-the-sole-hero status of contemporary Rwanda, he has amassed as many false arguments as his swelling numbers of victims: he is the Pan-Africanist who stopped Tutsi genocide, empowered women, rolled back malaria and HIV/AIDS, built hotels and conference centers, sent peacekeepers to represent American interests in Africa's hot spots, became a shining example of Africa-led development model, and now, as evidenced by his perfect vote, built a perfect democracy in Rwanda.\n\nKagame has conveniently forgotten that the civil wars of 1959 and 1990s, and the mass atrocities that followed them, were never about economic development but rather the exclusion of whole ethnic groups from power structures of the day. His benefactors and cheerleaders, chiefly the United States and the United Kingdom, have out of their seemingly perpetual guilt and geo-strategic selfishness amplified Kagame's selective amnesia, deadly outlook, and actions. Emboldened by having powerful allies, Kagame rules with reckless intransigence and impunity.\n\nThere are several reasons why Paul Kagame seeks to remain in power indefinitely. One of them is to prevent accountability for the crimes that he and those under his command have committed against Rwandan Hutu, including war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The silence and complicity of the international community reinforces Paul Kagame to rule with impunity. Coupled with pervasive fear that stems from rule by cliques, international indifference, as well as interference, these have been the key factors in Rwanda's cyclical and sectarian bloodshed. Regime changes in Rwanda, often citing legitimate grievances among Rwandans, and in recent history backed by foreign powers, have never redressed the structures of power from Rwanda's founding as a nation until now.\n\nNor have Rwanda's neighbours been spared the destabilizing effects of spillovers from its internal crises. Paul Kagame's regime has now become the principal destabilizing force in the Great Lakes region of Africa, notably the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi. Acting on its own appetite for natural resources from neighbouring countries, and championing foreign commercial and geostrategic interests, Kagame's RPF/DMI regime has acquired the shameful role previously played by dictators like President Mobutu of former Zaire during the Cold War.\n\nAt each turning point, as Rwanda witnessed cataclysmic upheaval characterized by extensive death and destruction, the international community abandoned defenseless people at the hands of violent cliques.\n\nTwo political organizations - MRND (Hutu clique) and RPF (Tutsi clique) that succeeded it in 1994 - have inflicted unparalleled damage to Rwandan society in its centuries-old history as a nation. In 1994, as the MRND establishment unleashed its security forces and militia against Tutsi in the fastest genocide ever recorded in human history, the international community abandoned Rwandans. Before, and in the aftermath of the Tutsi genocide, the new RPF establishment in power, through the notorious Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI) and Tutsi officers directly under Paul Kagame's command descended on the Hutu population in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, executing with ruthless efficiency what is now a well-documented and yet unrecognized genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The International community abandoned Rwandans by deliberately shielding and failing to bring Kagame's RPF/DMI regime to account for these atrocities.\n\nThe international community has once again abandoned Rwandans. The overt and covert support that Kagame's regime receives from the United States and United Kingdom, coupled with failures of the past, has led the majority of Rwandans to lose trust in the international community as a reliable partner in Rwanda's social, economic and political development.\n\nThe road to freedom, fundamental human rights, justice, democracy and the rule of law is long and particularly a dangerous one in Rwanda. Kagame's life presidency imperils Rwanda, the Great Lakes region, Africa and the international community.\n\nThere is no quick and cheap fix for tyranny. Dreadful as this reality is, it becomes crystal clear, urgent, and important, for Rwandans to seek Rwandan solutions for Rwandan problems in a self-reliant manner. The long term consequences of Kagame's role as Africa's leading destabilizer, looter, war-maker, and tyrant can be ignored by his foreign supporters for some time but are nevertheless grave and real.\n\nFor now, freedom and peace may seem distant dreams for the majority of Rwandans. Evidently, the price of uprooting the evil and entrenched roots of tyranny in Rwanda is likely to be high, and a product of united action to be executed in the short, medium and long term.\n\n* DR.

In 2011 President Paul Kagame tried him in absentia, and sentenced him to 24 years in jail for criticizing the regime's state of governance.

Human Rights Watch released a chronology of violations of the right to freedom of expression, association, and assembly in Rwanda between the country's December 2015 referendum - allowing the president to run for a third term - and the election, which Kagame won with a reported 98.79 percent of the vote.\n\n\"Kagame's landslide win came as no surprise in a context in which Rwandans who have dared raise their voices or challenge the status quo have been arrested, forcibly disappeared, or killed, independent media have been muzzled, and intimidation has silenced groups working on civil rights or free speech,\" said Ida Sawyer, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch. \"Yet the Rwandan authorities took no chances with the presidential vote, as repression continued in recent months despite the weak prospects for any opposition candidate.\"\n\nIn the days following the vote, Human Rights Watch spoke with local activists and private citizens who spoke of intimidation and irregularities in both the lead-up to the election and during the voting. In Rutsiro district, in Western Province, donations to the ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) were mandatory. \"Nobody could escape this order,\" said one voter. \"It was organized through the National Electoral Commission.\"\n\nAnother voter, also from Rutsiro, said that he was forced to vote in the presence of a National Electoral Commission official. \"After verifying my name on the voting list, I was told to vote then and there in front of him,\" the voter said. \"It was easy to see who I was voting for on the ballot, so it was impossible for me to vote for anyone besides Kagame.\"\n\nA person monitoring the vote in Nyamagabe District, in the south, said he saw voting officials sign ballots for at least 200 people who did not show up to vote. All the votes went to the RPF.\n\nOn August 5, the US State Department released a statement citing \"irregularities observed during voting.\" On August 6, the European Union released a statement supporting the peaceful elections but adding: \"in view of future elections, the EU expects further efforts to increase the inclusiveness and transparency of the process, in particular as regards the registration of the candidates, the tabulation of results and other prerequisites for achieving a level playing field.\"\n\nThree candidates contested the elections: Kagame (Rwandan Patriotic Front, RPF); Frank Habineza (Democratic Green Party of Rwanda, DGPR); and an independent candidate, Philippe Mpayimana. Both Habineza and Mpayimana said they experienced harassment, threats, and intimidation after announcing their candidacy. Neither posed a serious challenge to President Kagame. Mpayimana won 0.73 percent of the vote and Habineza won 0.48 percent.\n\nA person who monitored the campaign in Musanze, Burera, and Rulindo districts, in the Northern Province, said that local security forces went door-to-door in various neighborhoods before the vote, telling people not to participate in Habineza's campaign rallies. \"It was too much of a risk for most people to go to the rally and listen to what [Habineza] had to say,\" he said, \"so only a few people dared to go.\"\n\nTwo other would-be independent candidates, Diana Rwigara and Gilbert Mwenedata, said that they had fulfilled eligibility requirements of 600 signatures supporting their candidacy, including 12 from each of the 30 districts. But the National Electoral Commission rejected their efforts to register, claiming that many of the signatures were invalid. Another potential candidate, Thomas Nahimana, a Catholic prelate turned politician, was denied access to Rwanda in January when he tried to enter from France, where he now lives.\n\nOn August 3, Rwigara told the BBC Kinyarwanda service, which is banned in Rwanda, that five of her supporters had been arrested for wearing t-shirts supporting her political campaign. The supporters were later released.\n\nKagame himself boasted that the election results were already known during a campaign rally in Ruhango district, in Southern Province, in mid-July. \"I am very pleased because we are already aware of the results of the elections,\" he said. \"Anyone who says that results are not known is lying. The results were already known since December 2015.\"\n\nOn December 18, 2015, Rwandans overwhelmingly approved amendments to the constitution to allow Kagame to run again - a third term had not been permitted under the previous constitution. According to the official results, 98.3 percent of the 98 percent of registered voters who participated in the referendum voted in favor of the amendments.\n\nThe referendum followed attacks on suspected political and military opponents in the years since the RPF came to power in 1994, including murders both inside and outside of Rwanda.\n\nIn the period between the referendum and the August 2017 presidential elections, Human Rights Watch documented an ongoing pattern of harassment, arrests, and detention of opposition party leaders and supporters, activists, and journalists. Several were forcibly disappeared or prosecuted after making comments critical of the current government or ruling party.\n\nHuman Rights Watch has documented that poor people, critics of government decisions regarding land disputes, and suspected petty criminals have been arbitrarily arrested, held in illegal detention centers, and in some cases executed, forcibly disappeared, tortured, or mistreated. These tactics ensure that citizens are afraid to speak out against the government.\n\nThe revised constitution, among other things, reduces presidential terms to five years, renewable only once, after a transitional seven-year term starting in 2017. It also reset the clock on presidential terms already served. It allowed Kagame to run for a third seven-year term in 2017 and will allow him to run for two five-year terms, in 2024 and 2029, opening the possibility of extending his rule until 2034.\n\nThe process was initiated by a series of petitions in which more than 3.78 million people claimed to support extending Kagame's stay in office. Parliament, after national consultations, unanimously approved the amendments. The opposition DGPR lost a case before the Supreme Court challenging the proposal, and was the only registered political party to oppose the constitutional amendments.\n\n\"Rwanda's donors and partners should take a stronger stance against the government's many measures to clamp down on free expression and quash dissent, and make clear that there will be consequences,\" Sawyer said. \"While the country has made remarkable economic and development progress since the genocide that devastated the country in 1994, it should not come at the cost of the Rwandan people's most fundamental freedoms.\"\n\nChronology of Rwanda's Closing Space\n\nThe following charts several key political developments between January 2016 and August 2017, including many threats to and violations of the rights to freedom of expression, association, and assembly in Rwanda leading up to presidential elections on August 4, 2017. The list is not exhaustive. Human Rights Watch documented several other cases that are not included because the people concerned feared repercussions if their situation is publicized.\n\nPresident Paul Kagame announces his intention to run again.\n\nJanuary 29\n\nJohn Williams Ntwali, one of Rwanda's few investigative journalists, is arrested and accused of raping a minor. Judicial officials later changed the charge to indecent assault and eventually dropped the case for lack of evidence. Ntwali had been investigating several sensitive issues, including the death of Assinapol Rwigara, a businessman and father of would-be independent presidential candidate Diana Rwigara, whose candidacy was later rejected. Ntwali had been arrested several times before, and his website blocked by a government regulator, apparently because of his critical reporting.\n\nFebruary 3\n\nPolice confiscate the computers of East African newspaper journalists Ivan Mugisha and Moses Gahigi. They had been investigating cases of alleged tax evasion and corruption. The police briefly detained and questioned Mugisha.\n\nFebruary 8 - March 22\n\nLocal elections take place, at the level of the cell, district, and the city of Kigali - the capital. Several participants allege voter intimidation.\n\nThe Rwandan government withdraws its declaration allowing individuals to file complaints with the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights on the grounds that the remedy was being exploited by convicted genocide fugitives. The court had been due to hear a complaint against Rwanda, brought by Victoire Ingabire, president of the Forces d\u00e9mocratiques unifi\u00e9es (FDU)-Inkingi, an opposition party, serving a 15-years sentence after a flawed trial based partly on politically motivated charges.\n\nMarch 26\n\nL\u00e9onille Gasengayire, a FDU-Inkingi member, is arrested after visiting Ingabire in prison.\n\nMarch 26\n\nIllumin\u00e9e Iragena, a nurse and FDU-Inkingi member, is reported missing. There has been no news of her since. People close to her fear she may have died in detention. Iragena is married to Martin Ntavuka, the FDU-Inkingi's former Kigali representative, who has been arrested at least twice since 2010 in connection with his political activities.\n\nMarch 29\n\nThe police release Gasengayire, after beating and questioning her about a book she had attempted to bring to Ingabire in detention. She had also revealed that Iragena had been involved in trying to get the book to Ingabire.\n\nMarch 31\n\nA military court sentences Col. Tom Byabagamba, former head of the presidential guard, and retired Brig. Gen. Frank Rusagara, former secretary general of the Defense Ministry, to 21 and 20 years in prison respectively, including for inciting insurrection and tarnishing the government's image. The prosecution accused them of criticizing the government, alleging state involvement in assassinations of opponents, and complaining about foreign and economic policy. A prosecution witness said he was forced to testify against the two. Retired Sgt. Fran\u00e7ois Kabayiza, found guilty of concealing evidence, is sentenced to five years. He said in court that military personnel had tortured him in detention.\n\nApril 13\n\nAn intelligence agent questions Epimack Kwokwo, former executive secretary of the Regional Human Rights League in the Great Lakes Region (Ligue des droits de la personne dans la r\u00e9gion des Grands Lacs, LDGL), a regional nongovernmental organization that works on human rights issues, for several hours about his legal status in Rwanda and his work for the organization.\n\nMay 1\n\nBernard Ntaganda, an opposition leader, is arrested on suspicion that his party, the Social Party (PS)-Imberakuri, which has been unable to register, had wanted to organize a party meeting. He is charged with disobeying the enforcement of the law, organizing an illegal demonstration or public gathering, and illegal formation and leadership of a political organization, but is released the same day. Ntaganda had previously been arrested on June 24, 2010, and found guilty on February 11, 2011, of endangering national security, \"divisionism\" - inciting ethnic divisions - and attempting to organize demonstrations without official authorization. On appeal, the Supreme Court upheld the first two charges. He was released from prison in June 2014.\n\nMay 19\n\nCaroline Buisman, Ingabire's Dutch lawyer in her case at the African Court, is expelled from Rwanda. She had been in the country with a tourist visa because the immigration authorities had not granted her a regular visa. Over the years, Rwanda has expelled and refused entry to several international human rights lawyers, journalists, and researchers.\n\nMay 28\n\nImmigration services order Kwokwo, LDGL's former executive secretary and a Congolese national, to leave the country.\n\nAugust 8\n\nJohn Ndabarasa, a journalist at Sana Radio in Kigali, is reported missing. He is last seen in Kicukiro.\n\nAugust 23\n\nGasengayire is rearrested and charged with inciting insurrection or disorder among the population, in relation to her opposition to the expropriation of local residents' land and of promoting the FDU-Inkingi.\n\nAugust 30\n\nPolice tell news media that they opened an investigation into Ndabarasa's disappearance, after the Rwanda Media Commission, a media self-regulation body, informed them about the case.\n\nSeptember 18\n\nTh\u00e9ophile Ntirutwa, Kigali representative of the FDU-Inkingi, is arrested, allegedly by military, in Nyarutarama, a Kigali suburb.\n\nSeptember 20\n\nNtirutwa is released, after being beaten and questioned about his membership in the FDU-Inkingi. Ntirutwa had previously complained several times to authorities about threats and harassment by local officials, including because of his opposition to the constitutional amendments.\n\nLate September\n\nA European Parliament delegation that visits Rwanda is denied access to visit Ingabire in detention.\n\nOctober 8\n\nThe authorities arrest Joseph Nkusi, a Rwandan blogger deported from Norway, and question him about his political activities and his blog, which contains severe criticism of the Rwandan government, including unfounded theories about the genocide.\n\nOctober 15\n\nRobert Mugabe, editor of online media Great Lakes Voice, publishes an article alleging multiple kidnapping attempts in Kigali.\n\nDecember 28\n\nMugabe says he was called in for questioning by the police and accused of treason and disobeying the law.\n\nDecember 31\n\nShyaka Kanuma, a journalist and owner of Rwanda Focus, a Rwandan newspaper, is arrested, accused of tax evasion and fraud. Ten days earlier, he had sent several messages on WhatsApp announcing his intention to become an activist and saying he had been questioned by the head of the intelligence services. It is unclear whether his social media activities and his arrest and charges are linked.\n\nBoniface Twarigimana, the vice-president of the FDU-Inkingi, is questioned by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the Rwandan police about his alleged role in publishing information on extrajudicial killings. Human Rights Watch later reports on these killings and others in July.\n\nJanuary 31\n\nPhilippe Mpayimana arrives in Kigali from France and announces his intention to run as an independent presidential candidate. A pro-government online news outlet accuses him of minimizing the genocide, which Mpayimana denies.\n\nFebruary 14\n\nViolette Uwamahoro, a Rwandan-British woman married to a member of the Rwanda National Congress (RNC), an opposition group in exile, visiting Rwanda to attend her father's funeral, is reported missing in Kigali.\n\nMarch 1\n\nRwanda's withdrawal of its declaration allowing Rwandan individuals and non-governmental organizations access to the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights comes into force.\n\nMarch 3\n\nThe police announce that Uwamahoro is in government detention.\n\nMarch 3 - 6\n\nTwo family members and an acquaintance of Uwamahoro are forcibly disappeared. One, a policeman, later resurfaces in court and testifies against Uwamahoro. The two others are released several weeks later.\n\nMarch 6\n\nNdabarasa resurfaces in Kigali, more than six months after his disappearance in August 2016. He tells media that he had fled the country, but decided voluntarily to come back. The story raises suspicions.\n\nMarch 13\n\nThe trial against Nkusi starts at the High Court in Kigali, which later declares itself incompetent to deal with the case.\n\nMarch 13\n\nUwamahoro and a co-defendant are charged with revealing state secrets and offenses against the established government or the president. She is accused of inciting her co-accused to join the RNC and an armed movement outside of Rwanda.\n\nMarch 19\n\nThe DGPR confirms Frank Habineza as the party's presidential candidate. The party had been able to register in August 2013, a week before the deadline for the September parliamentary elections that year.\n\nMarch 23\n\nThe High Court chamber of Rusizi acquits and releases Gasengayire, after seven months in pretrial detention. During the trial, several witnesses say they were threatened.\n\nMarch 28\n\nUwamahoro is released on bail because of insufficient evidence to warrant her ongoing detention.\n\nThe Official Gazette is published, which contains National Electoral Commission regulations (from April 4) on social media use by candidates during the campaign. The regulations state that any candidate wanting to post campaign messages on social media networks must first submit the material to the commission for approval 48 hours in advance. The regulations draw criticism from government officials and the Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority.\n\nMay 3\n\nDiana Rwigara announces her intention to run in the presidential election. Seventy-two hours later, nude photos of her are published on social media in an apparent attempt to humiliate and intimidate her.

Every Rwandan has a country and with every other country, we seek partnership and cooperation,\" Kagame said at the inauguration.\n\nKagame won the August 4 election with 98.79 percent of votes against two little-known candidates.\n\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) said in a statement Friday the victory followed a campaign in which Rwandans were forced to donate money to the ruling party and blocked from attending opposition rallies.\n\n\"Kagame's landslide win came as no surprise in a context in which Rwandans who have dared raise their voices or challenge the status quo have been arrested, forcibly disappeared, or killed, independent media have been muzzled, and intimidation has silenced groups working on civil rights or free speech,\" said Ida Sawyer, HRW's Central Africa director.\n\nOne voter, from Rutsiro in western Rwanda, told HRW he had been forced to vote in front of an election official.\n\n\"It was easy to see who I was voting for on the ballot, so it was impossible for me to vote for anyone besides Kagame,\" he was quoted as saying.\n\nAfter the election, the United States said it was \"disturbed by irregularities\" observed during voting.\n\nKagame has ruled Rwanda with an iron fist since 2000 and will now be president until 2024, at which time he could seek two extra five year terms after a 2015 constitutional amendment.\n\nHe is credited with stabilising Rwanda after some 800,000 people -- mainly minority Tutsis -- were killed in the 1994 genocide at the hands of extremist Hutus.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team

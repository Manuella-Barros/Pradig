Two decades after Ronald's passing, NewsNation is honoring the late member of the Republican Party with a documentary titled Reagan: Portrait of a Presidency. The film, which is released today, June 8, will explore the former President's life through a different lens as it details the most shocking moments of his personal and professional journey - including his relationship with Nancy - who passed away in 2016. The couple, who wed in 1952 and were rumored to have only tied the knot because of Nancy's unplanned pregnancy, are said to have endured a rocky relationship. Their ups and downs will also be laid bare as viewers are transported back in time to experience Ronald's two Presidential terms in a new light. In a series of clips shared exclusively with DailyMail.com ahead of the documentary's release, Ronald and Nancy are shown looking lively as their infamous romance unfolded under public scrutiny. The first video showcases the couple - whose daughter recently made jaw-dropping claims regarding their relationship - taking a break from the daily Presidential matters to enjoy a bit of fun. In one segment, the lovers are seen fooling around at their California ranch, which they often referred to as the 'Western White House,' as they gardened. The 40th President began chuckling as he lifted the water hose up and began playfully spraying his wife. Nancy let out a faux scream in between a fit of giggles. Ronald then turned the water hose back to the grass before telling his wife that he had an 'idea' for an impromptu photoshoot. 'I have got another photo idea. I have got the chainsaw and you're holding me off,' he teased as Nancy stood beside him in disbelief. Despite her shock, the former First Lady took part in her spouse's gag and pretended she was stopping him from using the saw as the camera clicked in the background. After they finished snapping photos and teasing each other in the garden, they headed to the horse stable and enjoyed some quality time while riding. And while they loved being next to one another, Nancy admitted that she couldn't stand the heat as she complained: 'It feels like it's 110 degrees!' In the second rare video shared with DailyMail.com, the couple was once again seen doing some gardening work at their Western White House as they took in the beaming sun rays. The former President proved that he never really took a day off as he chopped some wood and did work on the outside of their ranch. 'Very scientific business here,' he joked as he built a DIY fence around an area of the ranch. 'You're not supposed to be lifting things,' Nancy demanded from off-camera at the end of the clip as her husband continued to work hard outdoors. Nancy and Ronald tied the knot in 1952 following the former President's divorce from first wife Jane Wyman. Last year, the couple's first-born daughter, Patti Davis, revealed that Nancy convinced Ronald to marry her after falling pregnant in 1952. Patti, now 72, who had a life-long rocky relationship with her mother, claimed that Nancy's out-of-wedlock pregnancy carrying Patti, was the secret reason for her parents' union. Nancy, unsuccessful as an actress, was one of the women then-Hollywood star Reagan was dating after his divorce from his first wife. During their nine-year marriage, Wyman had two children, Michael and Maureen, and a third, Christine, who died shortly after birth. According to Patti's account in her memoir, Dear Mom and Dad: A Letter About Family, Memory, and the America We Once Knew, her father and Wyman had 'made a pact' that he wouldn't remarry before she did. According to his daughter, Ronald was overjoyed he finally got to play the field and 'was not exactly anxious to get married again.' However, while at a dinner date with Ronald, Nancy dropped the bomb that she was two months pregnant. Patti noted that her father immediately excused himself from the table and telephoned Jane to tell her that he could no longer honor their marriage pact, adding that marriage was now in the cards for him because Nancy had become pregnant with his child. The Reagans were married on March 4, 1952, and Patti was born exactly six months later on October 4. The former President and Jane's divorce had been finalized in June 1949. During the first year of their union, according to Nancy's biographer, Kitty Kelley, Ronald continued to date an actress named Christine Larson, telling her that he had been 'tricked' into marriage by Nancy. Kitty even claimed that the President was with Christine when Patti was born - although she wrote that Nancy was no angel either and accused her of an affair with Frank Sinatra while in the White House. In her slender, but revelatory 186-page memoir, written like a letter to her late parents, Patti claimed that her birth was the one flaw in her mother's 'romantic illusion' with Ronald. Ronald died at 93 in 2004 after having Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade. Nancy passed away at 94 of heart failure in 2016. They are buried together at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.", "summary": "Unseen footage of Ronald and Nancy Reagan sahred with DailyMail.com has shown off the presidential couple's playful side and joking manner following the 20-year anniversary of the President's death", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-13506861/unseen-footage-nancy-tonald-reagan-president.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/07/22/85858159-0-image-m-94_1717794494817.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:56:23", "author": "Editor,Kelsi Karruli For", "authors": ["Editor", "Kelsi Karruli For"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.194}

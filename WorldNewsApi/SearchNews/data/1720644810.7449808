Toll Tax: To provide seamless and barrier-free tolling experience to National Highway users and to enhance the efficiency and transparency of toll operations, Indian Highways Management Company Limited (IHMCL), a company promoted by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), has invited global Expressions of Interest (EOI) from innovative and qualified companies to develop and implement GNSS-based electronic toll collection system in India. New feature will be available in FASTag NHAI plans to implement GNSS-based electronic toll collection (GNSS-ETC) system within the existing FASTag ecosystem. Initially, both RFID-based ETC and GNSS-based ETC will operate simultaneously using a hybrid model. Dedicated GNSS lanes will be available at toll plazas, allowing vehicles using GNSS-based ETC to pass through smoothly. As GNSS-based ETC becomes more widespread, all lanes will eventually be converted to GNSS lanes. Deadline for sending tender is 22 July The objective of the EOI is to identify experienced and capable companies to leverage advanced satellite technology to provide a robust, scalable and efficient toll charger software. It is likely to serve as the basis for implementation of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) based Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) in India. The EOI includes a complete plan of implementation and invites suggestions on the same. Interested companies may send their expression of interest by emailing tenders@ihmcl.com by 15:00 hrs (Indian Standard Time) on July 22, 2024. Toll evaders will be curbed The implementation of GNSS based electronic toll collection in India will facilitate smooth movement of vehicles on national highways. It is envisaged to provide several benefits to highway users through this, such as barrier-free free-flow tolling leading to a hassle-free movement experience and distance-based tolling where users will pay only for the distance traveled on the national highway. GNSS based electronic toll collection will also lead to greater efficiency in toll collection as it will help in plugging leakages and curbing toll evaders. GNSS based electronic toll collection in India will help in providing smooth and seamless travel experience to commuters on national highways.", "summary": "<p>Toll Tax: NHAI has invited bids (EOI) from across the world to implement satellite-based electronic toll collection system.

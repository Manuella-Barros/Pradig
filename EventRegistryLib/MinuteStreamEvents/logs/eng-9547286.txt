The hard-throwing prospect was working hard to make the Opening Day roster for the 2024 season but ended up not getting the call.\n\nHowever, on Wednesday, it was announced that Skenes is being called up to the big league level and will make his MLB debut on Saturday, May 11, in Pittsburgh against the Chicago Cubs. The Pirates made the announcement in a perfect video released on X.\n\nAt long last, Skenes is coming to the Pirates to take the mound in the big leagues.\n\nSkenes made five starts in the minor leagues in 2023, one at Rookie Ball, and two in both Single-A and Double-A. He posted a 5.40 ERA in short run, throwing just 6.2 innings.\n\nSkenes then got invited to Pirates Spring Training and ended up making a number of appearances, including one against the Baltimore Orioles and Jackson Holliday, another top prospect and former No. 1 overall draft pick.\n\nPaul Skenes was sent to Triple-A after not making the initial Opening Day roster, although it always figured to be a matter of time before he got the call. In 2024, he made seven starts for Triple-A Indianapolis and didn't record a win or loss. His ERA is at 0.99 and he threw 27.1 innings, giving up just 17 hits while striking out 45 batters.\n\nJust a few days before the call-up, Skenes gave up his first home run at the Triple-A level, although he finished the start with just a pair of earned runs. Prior to that home run, Skenes had gone 33.2 innings in a row without giving up a long ball.\n\nSkenes' tie in the minors went well, and his climb up the rankings was as quick as many expected. He made hitters miss a lot and kept hitting triple digits on the radar gun.\n\nThe Pirates calling up Skenes will be an exciting turn of events for the fanbase. They have begun the year with a 17-21 record entering Wednesday but have gone just 3-4 in the month of May. They begin a three-game series with the Cubs on Friday.\n\nSo, get your tickets and popcorn ready as Paul Skenes will make his MLB debut on Saturday at PNC Park against the Cubs.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_wadleigh@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Matt Wadleigh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Skenes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Skenes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Opening Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Class A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PNC Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call Centers", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Telephony", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Telephony", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Paul-Skenes-finally-gets-called-up-to-big-leagues-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547286", "eventUri": "eng-9547286", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 376, "textEnd": 382}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

Paul Skenes, the organization's No. 1 prospect, will be promoted to the big leagues.\n\nRated baseball's top pitching prospect by MLB Pipeline, Skenes will join the Pirates for their weekend series against the Chicago Cubs at PNC Park. He is expected to make his MLB debut at 4:05 p.m. Saturday.\n\nIt's a moment that should attract plenty of national attention toward the Pirates given how popular Skenes has become across the sport.\n\nIn the Pirates' eyes, though, they'll likely talk about this being the next box to check after his latest outing in the minor leagues: 4 1/3 innings, three hits, two earned runs, two walks, four strikeouts and one homer allowed on 66 pitches in his start Sunday.\n\nThe Pirates selected Skenes out of LSU with the first overall pick in last year's draft. The 6-foot-6 right-hander established himself as a national phenomenon last summer, going 13-2 with a 1.69 ERA en route to leading the Tigers to a national championship. Numerous scouts and analysts deemed Skenes the sport's best college pitching prospect since Stephen Strasburg.\n\nAfter inking a deal with the Pirates in late July - which included a $9.2 million signing bonus - Skenes made his professional debut with the Pirates' rookie ball team on Aug. 10, 2023. He then pitched twice for Single-A Bradenton and Double-A Altoona before his season was shut down in early September.\n\n\"They made the recommendation of, 'Hey, this is good. We're good for this year. Let's focus on a full offseason and full 2024,' \" Pirates general manager Ben Cherington told reporters a few days later. \"We got that recommendation from them later [Monday] night and communicated that with Paul today. Simple as that.\"\n\nSkenes entered 2024 as the No. 3 overall prospect in baseball, behind only Baltimore's Jackson Holliday and Milwaukee's Jackson Chourio. But despite flashing his elite potential throughout spring training, the Pirates approached Skenes' buildup for the season with caution.\n\nJust one day after his first outing in Bradenton, Fla., the club announced Skenes would start the regular season with Triple-A Indianapolis. The club was not shy when it came to their conservative approach with Skenes, who had a hard innings limit and pitch count cutoff each time he took the mound for the Indians.\n\n\"There's a plan that they came up with a long time ago,\" Skenes told the Post-Gazette after his first start of the season. \"I respect that. The temptation is probably there, but I'm never going to ask [to stay in a game] because I know what the plan is. Frankly, the pitching coaches that are here, I can air it out to them, but they're not the ones making the decision either.\"\n\nIn seven starts, Skenes dominated opposing minor league hitters, boasting a 0.99 ERA and 0.91 WHIP with 45 strikeouts in 27 1/3 innings of work. The hype surrounding the 6-foot-6, 235-pound righty extends far outside of Pittsburgh, as MLB made each of his starts free to watch via livestream.\n\nA traditional power pitcher, 98 of the 422 pitches Skenes threw this season have been clocked at over 100 mph. His top pitch is his four-seam fastball, which he has thrown 198 times (46.9%) at an average of 99.9 mph. His secondary pitches include a slider, split-finger, change-up and curveball.\n\n\"I was excited when we drafted him, just because he is a talented kid,\" manager Derek Shelton said of Skenes before Monday's game against the Angels. \"I was excited last year when he pitched. I was excited in spring training. The fact that we have a person that is this talented, yeah, that's exciting.\"\n\nSkenes has been a head-turning prospect since signing with the Pirates, his triple-digit fastball serving as his most famous weapon.\n\nBut as much as Skenes has pitched with power, he has also shown some finesse, sequencing pitches and locating far more consistently than someone his age normally would.\n\nAlong the way, Skenes has energized Pirates fans with his dominance, allowing folks to dream about a top of the rotation that includes not only Skenes but Jared Jones, as well.\n\nSoon, that dream will become reality.", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pittsburgh_post_gazette@myrtlebeachonline.com", "name": "Pittsburgh

He made five starts across three levels of pro ball last year, going from rookie ball to Double-A over the course of August and September.\n\nPrior to that, Skenes was the terror of the SEC last year. He spent 2023 baffling batters with LSU, helping to lead the team to a College World Series title with a 1.69 ERA and 209 strikeouts across 19 starts.\n\nThe Pirates had Skenes start in Triple-A this season, and there he has been mowing hitters down. After his seventh start of the season on Sunday, Skenes has an 0.99 ERA with 45 strikeouts and just eight walks. He surrendered the first home run of his professional career on Sunday as part of his two earned runs, which bumped his ERA from a minuscule 0.39.\n\nWhile some of those numbers make it appear that Skenes was MLB-ready long before now, they don't tell the whole story. He has made seven starts but is averaging less than four innings per start. He has still not thrown more than 75 pitches in a game, and he didn't throw more than 65 until April 24.\n\nThose are not major-league-caliber numbers, but there's a strategy behind it. The Pirates have been trying to stretch Skenes out slowly, adding a bit more work to each outing. They need him to improve his stamina to be an effective major-league pitcher -- but not at the cost of his health.\n\nWhile Skenes' last Triple-A start on Sunday wasn't his best, his outing the week before was arguably his top performance of the season. Against the Buffalo Bisons on April 30, Skenes gave up four hits and zero runs over a season-high six innings, striking out seven and walking one.\n\nSkenes is expected to make his first start for the Pirates on Saturday, when they host the Chicago Cubs.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liz_roscher@aol.com", "name": "Liz Roscher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bisons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bisons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Home_Based", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Home Based", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/tipMUY6JLtTqvwsJv1zk8Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_yahoo_sports_800/04648b03a2b6fe40a28abc2ac7b1f41d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547286", "eventUri": "eng-9547286", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-29", "textStart": 330, "textEnd": 336}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 1457, "textEnd": 1465}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 1926, "textEnd": 1934}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 226, "relevance": 1}

With the NCAA agreeing to the Name, Image, and Likeness policy, it's safe to say that Dunne is living the dream of every student athlete. Apart from making waves in gymnastics, she is also earning a lot of money from various endorsement deals, making her the highest-paid female NCAA athlete today.\n\nBut while things are going well with Dunne's budding career, it seems like things are also going in the right direction in terms of her romantic life. Let's get to know more about Olivia Dunne's rumored boyfriend Paul Skenes.\n\nOlivia Dunne's rumored boyfriend Paul Skenes\n\nPaul Skenes was born on May 29, 2002, in Fullerton, Calif. Skenes attended El Toro High School, where he suited up for the baseball team. While playing for El Toro, Skenes earned various distinctions such as all-county, all-conference, all-league, and all-state honors. Furthermore, Skenes was also a three-year letter winner, according to lsusports.net.\n\nCollege Baseball with the United States Air Force Academy\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Skenes attended the United States Air Force Academy. He played for the baseball team until his sophomore year. Skenes enjoyed a productive freshman season that saw him become Collegiate Baseball National Co-Freshman of the Year. He tallied a 2.96 ERA and 96 strikeouts in 85.2 innings during his second year.\n\nFurthermore, he also had a batting average of .314 with 10 doubles, 13 home runs, and 38 RBIs. After his sophomore year, Skenes earned a string of awards, including Mountain West Conference Co-Pitcher of the Year and the John Olerud Award. He was also named First Team All-American.\n\nPaul Skenes transfers to LSU\n\nAfter two years with Air Force, Skenes transferred to LSU. While playing for the Tigers, Paul Skenes further boosted his stock. In his first and only season with LSU, Skenes finished with a 1.69 ERA to go along with 209 strikeouts, which was enough to shatter the school record.\n\nBut more importantly, Skenes played an instrumental role in leading the Tigers to a championship victory at the Men's College World Series in 2023. For Skenes' efforts, he earned the Dick Howser Trophy, College World Series Most Outstanding Player, and National Pitcher of the Year Award.\n\nPaul Skenes is drafted by the Pirates\n\nAfter three years of college baseball, Skenes declared for the 2023 MLB Draft. The Pittsburgh Pirates selected the LSU star pitcher in the first round with the first overall pick.\n\nShortly after, he signed a lucrative deal with the Pirates that contained a signing bonus worth $9.2 million. As per ESPN, the $9.2 million deal is enough to become the most lucrative rookie deal in MLB history, breaking the previous record set by Spencer Torkelson back in 2020.\n\nTo hone his skills further, the Pirates assigned the top pick of the 2023 MLB Draft to play for the Florida Complex League Pirates. A few days later, the Pirates sent Skenes to the Bradenton Marauders, the affiliate of Single-A.\n\nPaul Skenes makes his professional baseball debut\n\nIn his debut with the Marauders, Skenes struck out a pair of batters in a 16-pitch scoreless inning. Furthermore, he also threw 11 pitches for strikes to help his team secure a 14-13 win at the expense of the Lakeland Flying Tigers. In fact, the National Pitcher of the Year winner was quite satisfied with his performance.\n\nAccording to MLB, Skenes said after the game, \"It's getting back on the mound after a month-and-a-half off. I've been throwing the whole time, but you can't replace the adrenaline and the fans and with a hitter in the box.\n\n\"You can't replace that in the bullpen, so sometimes you don't know exactly what you're going to get just because your body moves different. Your body moves faster when there are those factors in there. So I was really happy with my ability to command it today, especially for it being so early.\"\n\nThe Pirates limited Skenes to just 7 2/3 innings after carrying the load for LSU en route to winning the CWS. In 2024, the Pirates assigned Skenes to AAA Indianapolis, where he started seven games and had a 0.99 ERA but averaged fewer than four innings a start. He had 45 strikeouts and just eight walks and one home run allowed in 27 1/3 innings.\n\nThe Pirates saw enough from Skenes to believe he was ready for The Show. They announced that Skenes will be making his MLB debut on Saturday, May 11, against the Chicago Cubs in a home game.\n\nIn the past, Dunne has revealed the qualities of her ideal partner, per firstsportz.com. Fast forward to today, it seems like Skenes has fit the bill.\n\nGiven that Dunne and Skenes both attended LSU, it isn't surprising two actually first met at the university.\n\nAs of late, Dunne has been posting on social media featuring the budding baseball star. In fact, the gymnastics and social media star certainly got the attention of baseball fans when she was wearing Skenes' jersey while supporting him in his debut with the Bradenton Marauders against the Lakeland Flying Tigers.\n\nWith Skenes and the Marauders coming away with the victory, it's interesting to see if Dunne's presence played a role in Skenes' Single-A debut outing.\n\nIn August 2023, Skenes confirmed in an interview that he was in a relationship with Dunne.\n\nNevertheless, this is all the information that we have on Olivia Dunne's rumored boyfriend Paul Skenes.", "source":

His girlfriend, LSU gymnast Livvy Dunne, didn't get the memo until after she rose from a midday snooze.\n\nDunne posted a TikTok video after the news broke of Skenes' promotion, with the caption \"POV: you both wake up from a nap and find out he's in the MLB.\" The video was posted by Major League Baseball's official X account Wednesday night.\n\nThe former LSU stars were romantically linked before Skenes made things public last August. Dunne has been spotted at several of Skenes' games since he was selected with the No. 1 overall pick in last year's MLB Draft.\n\nSkenes and Dunne both enjoyed success in their respective final collegiate seasons. They were each key members of national championship squads as LSU's baseball team won the 2023 College World Series while the gymnastics team captured its first national title this April.\n\nPaul Skenes ready for the big leagues\n\nDespite only recording 34 innings in the minor leagues, the Pirates made the call to promote Skenes to the majors. It's an unprecedented move, but one that isn't a surprise given what the 21-year-old has shown in his short time as a professional.\n\nSkenes posted a 0.99 ERA across seven starts in Triple-A this season, adding 45 strikeouts compared to 17 hits in 27.1 innings of work. Most of his starts were short, though he was stretched in his last three. He tossed a six-inning shutout on April 30 which slotted between two starts that each lasted 4.1 innings.\n\nOverall, Skenes has a 1.85 ERA in 12 minor league starts dating back to last August. The Pirates had a set plan in place to limit his innings because of his workload over his last two college seasons. He was on the mound for over 122 innings for LSU in 2023, a big jump from the 85.2 innings he pitched with Air Force in 2022.\n\nSkenes has a five-pitch mix that should play in the MLB. His fastball consistently sits at triple-digits, though scouts are drooling over his slider, his primary secondary pitch. He also throws a changeup, curveball and a pitch coined a \"splinker\" which is a hybrid between a splitter and sinker.\n\nSkenes will take the mound with the Pirates for the first time against the Chicago Cubs on Saturday in the most-anticipated MLB debut for a pitcher since Stephen Strasburg in 2010.\n\nPirates looking for a spark\n\nThe Pirates are not expected to reach the playoffs this season, but there's a chance they can sneak into the NL Central race with no clearcut favorite at the moment.\n\nPittsburgh is 17-21, five games behind the Cubs and Milwaukee Brewers who are tied for first place in the division. The Pirates begin a stretch of 10 consecutive games against divisional opponents on Friday.\n\nThe Pirates have not made the playoffs since 2015 and had one winning season since. Paul Skenes' debut is sure to bring renewed optimism to the Pittsburgh faithful. Perhaps he is the spark that this young Pirates team needs to take the next step and become a sleeper playoff contender in the National League.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_meyers@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Andrew Meyers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Skenes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Skenes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Strasburg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Strasburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force_Academy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force Academy"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curveball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curveball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Pirates-news-Paul-Skenes-girlfriend-Livvy-Dunne-reacts-to-MLB-call-up.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547286", "eventUri": "eng-9547286", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 1543, "textEnd": 1551}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

Skenes, whose fastball regularly hits triple digits, is 0-0 with a 0.99 ERA in seven Triple-A starts, with 45 strikeouts in 27 1/3 innings.\n\nHe is considered among baseball's top prospects and comes with unusual star power for a baseball rookie, in part because of his relationship with LSU gymnast and social media influencer Livvy Dunne.\n\nThe Pirates have brought Skenes along slowly during the spring, methodically ramping up his pitch count at Triple-A. They have given him a little more latitude recently. He threw 75 pitches on April 30 and 66 on Sunday against Buffalo.\n\nSkenes joins a rotation that includes 22-year-old rookie Jared Jones, who has a 2.63 ERA through seven starts and whose 52 strikeouts were ninth in the majors entering Wednesday.\n\nPittsburgh has floundered of late following a strong start. The Pirates, who are off Thursday, are 6-16 over their last 22 games after falling to the Los Angeles Angels 5-4 on Wednesday.\n\nSkenes' arrival represents a significant milepost for the organization. General manager Ben Cherington has overseen a top-to-bottom overhaul since taking over in the fall of 2019. Some of the pieces he has acquired and/or developed since his arrival either are on the major league roster (Jones) or on the cusp.\n\nIt also starts the clock on Pittsburgh's hopeful return to contention. The Pirates finished last in the NL Central from 2019-22 before taking a step forward last season. The expectation internally is for the competitive window to open either this year or next. Skenes could have an outsized impact on the timeline.\n\nSkenes' debut figures to be the most anticipated by a major league pitching prospect since Stephen Strasburg arrived in the majors with Washington in 2009 and promptly struck out 14 Pirates players in his first start.\n\nThe last Pittsburgh pitcher to reach the majors with this much hype came in 2013 when Gerrit Cole -- a first-round pick in 2011 -- joined a team that ended a streak of 20 consecutive losing seasons. Cole was a fixture in a rotation that helped the Pirates reach the playoffs from 2013-15 before ultimately being traded to Houston in January 2018.\n\nPittsburgh moved on from Cole in part because of concerns about being able to pay him long-term. The Pirates appear to be in a slightly different position now, having signed third baseman Ke'Bryan Hayes, centerfielder Bryan Reynolds and pitcher Mitch Keller to lengthy contracts in recent years.\n\nSkenes, if he delivers on his considerable promise, may test Pittsburgh's commitment. That discussion, however, is for down the road. For now, Skenes' debut gives the Pirates something they have lacked for most of the last decade: considerable buzz.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"},

Paul Skenes is coming, and very soon.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Pirates stirred the MLB world up with an epic announcement. Skenes, a former top overall MLB Draft pick out of LSU, will join the Pirates on May 11, 2024.\n\nHow did the Pirates create all this attention? It wasn't just with an ordinary announcement. No, instead, the Buccos played this one differently. The team dropped an epic video, featuring Skenes, hyping up his looming MLB debut.\n\nThe video featured audio of Skenes' selection in the MLB Draft and several MLB Network voices, and the voice of scouts who predicted Skenes could climb the ladder quickly. Climb the ladder Skenes did.

The transaction isn't official yet, but the club posted a sizzle reel of Skenes warming up and posing for the camera with a caption that simply read \"5.11.24.\"\n\nThe 21-year-old righty will become the fourth-youngest player and youngest pitcher on an active roster when he gets called up this weekend.\n\nSkenes' arrival has been hotly anticipated, and many have been prognosticating about it since the offseason. The Pirates selected Skenes with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 MLB Draft, after all, and he has been heralded as the best pitching prospect to come out of the college ranks since Stephen Strasburg in 2009.\n\nIn his final season at LSU, Skenes went 13-2 with a 1.69 ERA, 0.750 WHIP and 15.3 strikeouts per nine innings. He was named College World Series Most Outstanding Player just three weeks before he signed a record-breaking $9.2 million deal with Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Pirates had Skenes join them for parts of their big league Spring Training camp, only to stash him in Triple-A to open the 2024 regular season. He made seven starts in the minors before getting the call, as Pittsburgh's front office was content being patient with the flamethrower.\n\nSkenes boasted a 0.99 ERA, 0.915 WHIP and 14.8 strikeouts per nine innings with the Indianapolis Indians, getting more than comfortable in his 27.1 innings of work.\n\nThe 6-foot-6, 235-pound youngster routinely breaks 100 miles per hour with his fastball. He also utilizes a slider, changeup, curveball and \"splinker\" - a hybrid between a splitter and a sinker.\n\nSkenes will join a Pirates rotation that already includes homegrown ace Mitch Keller, standout rookie Jared Jones and former top prospect Quinn Priester. Offseason addition Mart\u00edn P\u00e9rez has been carrying his weight as well, giving Pittsburgh a well-rounded group to lead an up-and-coming squad.\n\nThe No. 3 prospect and No. 1 pitching prospect in the league will surely draw plenty of eyeballs when the Pirates and Cubs face off Saturday.

He was the highest-ranked prospect still in the minors because Jackson Chourio (No. 2) started the year with the Milwaukee Brewers and Jackson Holliday (No. 1) was called up by the Baltimore Orioles on April 10.\n\nHolliday has since been sent back down to the minors on April 26 after going 2-for-34 in 10 games.\n\nSkenes was selected first overall last year after a dominant season at LSU. He won the Dick Howser Trophy given to the nation's best player, was named SEC Pitcher of the Year and College World Series Most Outstanding Player in 2023.\n\nThe 21-year-old finished his junior year with a 1.69 ERA and 209 strikeouts in 122.2 innings over 19 starts for the Tigers. He only played one season at LSU after transferring from Air Force.\n\nThe Pirates made Skenes the first pitcher to be taken with the top pick in the draft since Casey Mize went to the Detroit Tigers in 2018. He was always considered someone who could breeze through the minors quickly, but the team informed him early in spring training he wouldn't start this season in the big leagues.\n\nHere's what general manager Ben Cherington told reporters on March 5 about Skenes' development plan:\n\n\"He has not had the benefit of the full Minor League season. We're also trying to put him in a position where he has the best chance possible to help us win games in Pittsburgh as soon as possible. We just think a little bit more time in Major League Spring Training around our staff, players, the catching group, the game-planning process, kind of everything about it, hopefully can speed that up just a little bit more. And then that'll play into how we get the season started and what the volume progression looks like going into the season.\"\n\nThe Pirates, like every other team with top pitching prospects, carefully managed Skenes' innings in the minors. He didn't throw more than 3.1 innings in each of his first three starts at Triple-A.\n\nSkenes' results in those limited outings looked great with no runs, four hits allowed and 19 strikeouts in 9.1 innings.\n\nPittsburgh finally started to loosen the reins on Skenes starting with his April 24 start against Omaha. He allowed his first run of the season in that game, but also struck out seven in 4.1 innings.\n\nSkenes' threw a career-high six innings and had seven strikeouts on April 30 in Indianapolis' 4-3 win over Buffalo.\n\nThe upside for Skenes is astronomical with a fastball that touches 102 mph, a wipeout slider and a solid changeup. He's a terrific athlete with a 6'6\" frame and commands all of his pitches very well.\n\nIt shouldn't take long for Skenes to establish himself as the best pitcher on the Pirates' staff.", "source":

He needs to be in the American or National League,\" Texas A&M coach Jim Schlossnagle told The Athletic's Brody Miller.\n\nSchlossnagle also told Miller that Skenes was among the best three college pitchers he'd seen, joining Stephen Strasburg and Mark Prior. Both Strasburg and Prior made their highly anticipated major-league debuts in the calendar year after they were drafted. Skenes will be once again in that same company.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates announced on Wednesday that Skenes will debut on Saturday versus the Chicago Cubs. It will arguably be the most eagerly anticipated starting pitcher debut since Strasburg in June 2010.\n\nSkenes' ascent from part-time reliever/catcher at Air Force to major-league phenom has been as swift as one of his 100 mph fastballs. Following two years at the Air Force Academy, Skenes transferred to LSU, where he went 13-2 with a 1.69 ERA and 209 strikeouts in 122 2/3 innings while bringing the CWS trophy back to Baton Rogue. After going first overall in last year's MLB Draft, Skenes made five brief appearances in the Pirates system, tossing 6 2/3 innings with a 5.40 ERA and a 10:2 K:BB. The Pirates knew they were getting a special player and person when they took him in the draft, but he exceeded those expectations in their early interactions with him.\n\n\"This is the most self-aware 21-year-old baseball player I've been around,\" Pirates farm director John Baker told The Athletic last September.\n\nSkenes began this spring as the No. 1 pitching prospect in baseball, according to The Athletic's Keith Law. There was some talk over the winter that perhaps Skenes would leap right to the big leagues, but the Pirates quelled that notion when he made only two official appearances in major-league camp. Still, even as the regular season began with Skenes in Triple A, it seemed only a matter of time before he'd be toeing a major-league rubber.\n\nWith every start he made, that anticipation only grew. He didn't allow a run until his fifth start. In his seventh start, he allowed his first home run. Even with those \"blemishes,\" he posted otherworldly numbers for Indianapolis -- a 0.99 ERA and a 45:8 K:BB in 27 1/3 innings.\n\nThe numbers, of course, only tell part of the story with Skenes, who -- like Prior and Strasburg before him -- can make skilled hitters look like Little Leaguers with his combination of plus fastball velocity (he regularly breaks triple digits) and wipeout slider.\n\n\"(He) hides the ball extremely well behind his body thanks to a compact arm action, allowing him to get away with some iffy fastball command and below-average life on the pitch,\" Law noted in his preseason top-100 prospect report. \"He offers ace ceiling, with size and arm strength you can't teach.\"\n\nLaw also noted that Skenes would need to throw his changeup more frequently in the pros than he did in college and add sinker, two boxes he checked in his minor-league outings this spring. (He's also been throwing a splitter and an occasional curveball.) Triple-A hitters had no answer for this improved version of Skenes. They hit only .175 against him with four extra-base hits. Now, he'll get the ultimate test in the big leagues.\n\nSkenes joins an improving Pirates staff that already includes Mitch Keller and promising rookie Jared Jones, as well as second-year starter Quinn Priester. Top prospects Anthony Solometo and Bubba Chandler are currently in Double A and could bolster the Pittsburgh staff as soon as next season.\n\nHow the Pirates are managing young arms, a Leiter family

Skenes, whose fastball regularly hits triple digits, is 0-0 with a 0.99 ERA in seven Triple-A starts, with 45 strikeouts in 27 1/3 innings.\n\nHe is considered among baseball's top prospects and comes with unusual star power for a baseball rookie, in part because of his relationship with LSU gymnast and social media influencer Livvy Dunne.\n\nThe Pirates have brought Skenes along slowly during the spring, methodically ramping up his pitch count at Triple-A. They have given him a little more latitude recently. He threw 75 pitches on April 30 and 66 on Sunday against Buffalo.\n\nSkenes joins a rotation that includes 22-year-old rookie Jared Jones, who has a 2.63 ERA through seven starts and whose 52 strikeouts were ninth in the majors entering Wednesday.\n\nPittsburgh has floundered of late following a strong start. The Pirates, who are off Thursday, are 6-16 over their last 22 games after falling to the Los Angeles Angels 5-4 on Wednesday.\n\nSkenes' arrival represents a significant milepost for the organization. General manager Ben Cherington has overseen a top-to-bottom overhaul since taking over in the fall of 2019. Some of the pieces he has acquired and/or developed since his arrival either are on the major league roster (Jones) or on the cusp.\n\nIt also starts the clock on Pittsburgh's hopeful return to contention. The Pirates finished last in the NL Central from 2019-22 before taking a step forward last season. The expectation internally is for the competitive window to open either this year or next. Skenes could have an outsized impact on the timeline.\n\nSkenes' debut figures to be the most anticipated by a major league pitching prospect since Stephen Strasburg arrived in the majors with Washington in 2009 and promptly struck out 14 Pirates players in his first start.\n\nThe last Pittsburgh pitcher to reach the majors with this much hype came in 2013 when Gerrit Cole -- a first-round pick in 2011 -- joined a team that ended a streak of 20 consecutive losing seasons. Cole was a fixture in a rotation that helped the Pirates reach the playoffs from 2013-15 before ultimately being traded to Houston in January 2018.\n\nPittsburgh moved on from Cole in part because of concerns about being able to pay him long-term. The Pirates appear to be in a slightly different position now, having signed third baseman Ke'Bryan Hayes, centerfielder Bryan Reynolds and pitcher Mitch Keller to lengthy contracts in recent years.\n\nSkenes, if he delivers on his considerable promise, may test Pittsburgh's commitment. That discussion, however, is for down the road. For now, Skenes' debut gives the Pirates something they have lacked for most of the last decade: considerable buzz.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The right-hander stands 6-foot-6 and 235 pounds, and has spent this spring leering at minor league hitters before blowing triple-digit heat past them.\n\nSkenes' first start will be one of the must-watch moments early this MLB season. So here's the skinny on Skenes, from his meteoric ascent on the mound to the social-media star (and fellow LSU national champion) he's dating.\n\nGood call. Let's get that out of the way. Have you heard of Livvy Dunne? How about Baby Gronk? Does \"Baby Gronk rizzed up Livvy\" ring any bells?\n\nI wish it didn't for me, either. Suffice it to say Dunne is an outrageously popular social media influencer -- 13 million followers across Instagram and TikTok. She recently wrapped up an accomplished gymnastics career at LSU with a national championship. Dunne's $3.9 million NIL valuation, per On3, ranked second among college athletes to Colorado QB Shedeur Sanders.\n\nBut back to her boyfriend: Dunne's dating the Velo King, not the Drip King.\n\nAfter starring at El Toro High School in Lake Forest, Calif., Skenes (a Los Angeles Angels fan at heart) chose the Air Force Academy because he wanted to play ball and be a fighter pilot. Few schools offer both opportunities.\n\nBack then, Skenes was a catcher. He batted .410/.486/.697 as a freshman at Air Force and also filled in as the team's closer. He entered the rotation as a sophomore and began looking like a bonafide two-way star. Skenes transferred to LSU and settled in as a full-time pitcher. The LSU lineup, led by outfielder Dylan Crews -- who many believed would be the No. 1 pick in the 2023 MLB Draft -- didn't need another bat as much as it needed Skenes' golden right arm.\n\nWith a fastball-slider combo, Skenes sliced through SEC lineups littered with soon-to-be pro talent. He went 13-2 with a 1.69 ERA and 0.75 WHIP, striking out 209 and walking 20 in 122 2/3 innings. He set the SEC single-season strikeout record previously owned by LSU's Ben McDonald, who was drafted No. 1 by Baltimore in 1989 and debuted later that same season.\n\nThe Tigers topped Florida for the national title, and Skenes was named the College World Series' Most Outstanding Player.\n\nThe Pirates, having won MLB's draft lottery, picked Skenes over Crews, who went No. 2 to the Nationals. Skenes signed for a record $9.2 million bonus.\n\nLet's put it this way. He made headlines when he gave up his first home run.\n\nLast week.\n\nIndeed, Skenes dominated. The mustachioed right-hander had a 0.99 ERA and 0.92 WHIP in seven starts for Triple-A Indianapolis this spring, striking out 45 and walking eight in 27 1/3 innings.\n\nThe Pirates have elected to bring him along slowly, which gets at another thing you might be wondering: Why wasn't Skenes in the majors earlier? It's a fair question. Skenes was inarguably one of the organization's top five starting pitchers from the moment he signed last summer. But given that Skenes had endured a long college season, throwing 122 2/3 innings for LSU, the fourth-place Pirates had him throw only 6 2/3 more before shutting him down last September.\n\nThey eased Skenes into a regular workload this spring, hoping a slow-and-steady approach might lessen his changes of getting hurt at a time when everyone's arms are hurt. Skenes threw twice for the big-league club in spring training, then slowly increased his pitch count over the past month and a half with Indianapolis, from as low as 44 pitches to as many as 75.\n\nIt's hard to knock a cautious approach. It's also bears mentioning that the plan ensured Skenes, who'll turn 22 later this month, won't receive a full year of MLB service time in 2024.\n\nThe Athletic's Keith Law has written up a detailed explanation, but the gist is that Skenes' primary pitch is a four-seam fastball -- regularly clocked at 100-plus mph -- but his secondaries are even more important.\n\nSkenes excelled in college throwing almost exclusively fastballs and stomach-lurching sliders. He has since diversified his arsenal. There's a changeup mixed in against left-handed hitters, and an occasional curveball to catch a hitter napping. The most interesting addition, though, is a \"splinker\" -- a spitter-sinker hybrid. It carries the type of mid-90s mph velocity many pitchers top out at and combines it with a decent amount of drop.\n\nThere's no one pitch Skenes could show the Cubs on Saturday that they've never seen before. But the combination of his offerings, when commanded well, will make hitters queasy.\n\nBut getting there starts with this question: What if Skenes is an ace?\n\nHaving Skenes starting alongside 2023 All-Star Mitch Keller and (2024 All-Star?) Jones, all of whom are under club control until at least 2028, sets a foundation upon which the franchise can build its next playoff contender. So much can go wrong, particularly with pitchers and their arm health. But on the weekend Skenes arrives, it's better to consider all that could go right.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_j_nesbitt@theathletic.com", "name": "Stephen J.

The Pittsburgh Pirates have finally made the move to bring their highly touted prospect, Paul Skenes, to the Major Leagues. Standing at an imposing 6'6\" and weighing 235 pounds, Skenes epitomizes the image of a power-armed ace on the mound. Widely acclaimed as one of the premier pitching talents in baseball, he was Pittsburgh's top selection in last year's draft.\n\nSkenes features a dominant fastball with a velocity routinely sitting in the triple-digit range. He complements that with a sharp big-league-level sweeping slider and a pitch dubbed a \"splinker,\" a hybrid between a sinker and splitter that sits in the mid-90s and runs in on righties and away from lefties.\n\nSkenes built his reputation in college over the last few years, showcasing his dominance with a remarkable 2.18 ERA and an eye-popping strikeout rate of over 36% throughout his collegiate career. His journey began at the Air Force Academy. It continued after a transfer to Louisiana State University, where he played a pivotal role in guiding the Tigers to a national championship. In his final season, Skenes boasted an astounding 1.69 ERA across 122 innings, striking out 45% of batters faced.\n\nWhile Paul Skenes' statistics may suggest he's been ready for the big leagues for some time, his journey to MLB readiness has been carefully managed. Pirates general manager Ben Cherington and skipper Derek Shelton have been vocal about the plan to stretch out Skenes' pitch count properly. Despite making seven starts, he's been limited to less than four innings per outing. He hasn't exceeded 75 pitches in a game, with his pitch count only surpassing 65 in late April.\n\nThis cautious approach serves a purpose. The Pirates have been methodically stretching out Skenes, gradually increasing his workload while prioritizing his long-term health. Developing his stamina is crucial for his success at the major league level, and the team is keen on achieving this without risking injury.\n\nAlthough his most recent Triple-A start wasn't his finest, Skenes showcased his potential in the previous outing. Against the Buffalo Bisons on April 30, he delivered a stellar performance, allowing zero runs on four hits across a season-high six innings while tallying seven strikeouts and issuing just one walk.\n\nThe Pirates currently sit in fourth place in the NL Central, five full games behind the division-leading Brewers and Cubs. But the Pirates are constructing one of the most exciting young pitching staffs in major league baseball. The Pirates' rotation is anchored by Mitch Keller, whose contract was extended this spring, and rookie Jared Jones.\n\nSkenes' arrival in the Pirates' rotation coincides with the emergence of fellow rookie RHP Jared Jones, who appears poised to establish himself as a top-tier arm. At just 22 years old, Jones was already a top-100 prospect heading into the season. His performance thus far has been stellar, boasting a 2.63 ERA, a striking 33.8% strikeout rate, and an impressive 3.2% walk rate across 41 innings pitched.\n\nWith the addition of Skenes, this trio has the potential to form the core of the Pirates' rotation for the foreseeable future in Pittsburgh. Skenes is slated to make his highly anticipated MLB debut on May 11 when the Pirates play host to the Chicago Cubs.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_lynch@heavy.com", "name": "Colin Lynch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Skenes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul Skenes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slider_(pitch)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slider (pitch)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-finger_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Split-finger fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Shelton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derek Shelton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Cherington", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Cherington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force_Academy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force Academy"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Keller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Keller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_behind", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Games behind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bisons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bisons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2048838439-1-e1715209624371.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547286", "eventUri": "eng-9547286", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 2141, "textEnd": 2149}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 3265, "textEnd": 3271}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Their starting rotation has been solid to begin the season, boasting an ERA of 3.64, which ranks 10th in baseball. As a staff, the Pirates are 11th in ERA (3.70) and eighth in WHIP (1.20). Skenes should only make those numbers better.\n\nOffense is really where the Pirates are deficient. Their OPS (.634) ranks 28th in baseball, while they're 29th in slugging (.331), 22nd in on-base percentage (.303), 26th in batting average (.221), 27th in home runs (27) and 26th in runs scored (130). They need tons of help on that side of things.\n\nDespite the team's woeful offense, Pittsburgh should get a huge boost from Skenes. His first outing arguably will be the most-anticipated pitching debut since the Washington Nationals called up Stephen Strasburg on June 8, 2010.\n\nAt 6'6\" and 235 pounds, Skenes is a classic power pitcher. His fastball is electric and can hit 102 mph, while his upper-80s slider is likely the best secondary pitch in the minors right now. He also features a low-90s changeup that is only improving. He's an intimidating figure on the mound and that should carry to the big leagues.\n\nPaul Skenes is finally coming. The Pirates are hoping he's the piece that turns around their middling start to the season.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeouts_per_nine_innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeouts per nine innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Power pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Strasburg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Strasburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_7120,h_4005,x_0,y_554/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01hxd0bz6tkvh2m62td4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547286", "eventUri": "eng-9547286", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-06-08", "textStart": 1751, "textEnd": 1763}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

No matter how well-thought-out the steps, how sound the logic, how reasoned the process, the success of a pitcher hangs in the balance. Even if a team does everything right, it still can go very, very wrong.\n\nFor the last month, Paul Skenes, the subject of all the planning, has carved up Triple-A hitting. His long-awaited debut in Pittsburgh is imminent, with the Pirates announcing he will start Saturday against the Chicago Cubs, and Skenes will arrive with a bullet train worth of hype. He went to the Pirates with the No. 1 overall pick in last year's draft, the deepest in recent memory. He is capable of doing things with a baseball unlike any man before him: No starter in the big leagues ever has thrown as consistently hard as Skenes.\n\nNone of that hoopla factored into Pittsburgh's approach to his 2024 season, but the alarming rates at which it has watched the game's best hit the injured list certainly did. The Pirates didn't want to rush the right-hander -- and they didn't want to hold him back, either. They loved everything about him -- except for all of the things they couldn't know. They drew a roadmap they hoped would bring out the best in him -- and acknowledged they had no clue whether it would succeed.\n\n\"I don't claim that we have any sort of scientific master formula for how we're doing this,\" Pirates general manager Ben Cherington said. \"I don't know for sure that this plan is right. I can't say that.\"\n\nIf we judge Skenes' success on outcome over process, all has gone according to plan. Skenes has been everything he's supposed to be: 6-foot-6 and 235 pounds of dominance, with an average fastball of 100 mph and four other pitches with which he befuddles hitters. Less than a year out from a College World Series appearance, he has a 0.99 ERA with 45 strikeouts in 27.1 innings for Triple-A Indianapolis this season.\n\nThe Pirates, though, understand that results-oriented analyses are inherently flawed. And while they found no comfort in managing the future face of their franchise with what amounts to an educated guess, they were able to take solace in at least one thing: When it comes to following a plan, Skenes has plenty of experience.\n\nWHEN HE ARRIVED at the Air Force Academy in 2021, Skenes did not appear on any list to be the next great major league pitcher for a good reason: He was a catcher. As a freshman, he hit .410/.486/.697 with 32 extra-base hits in 188 at-bats. He was also the Falcons' closer, notching 11 saves and showing enough acumen to go full Ohtani as a sophomore, starting 15 games on the mound and spending the rest of the time behind the plate.\n\nSchools around the country took notice. Skenes entered the transfer portal and drew widespread interest. While some teams wanted him as a two-way player, LSU recruited him strictly to pitch. It appealed to Skenes, as did the Tigers' pitching coach, Wes Johnson, who had parlayed a successful college coaching career into the Minnesota Twins' major league pitching coach job before returning to the amateur ranks with LSU.\n\n\"He knew what he needed to do, but he didn't know how. He was hunting the how,\" Johnson said. \"We got in there, and from his diet to learning a slider, we helped him figure that out.\"\n\nDeeply thoughtful and impressively methodical, Skenes gobbled up the knowledge offered by Johnson -- in some cases literally. Typically, a pitcher throwing with the force of Skenes burns about 5,000 calories a game. To combat the energy drain of pitching, Johnson suggested Skenes supplement his diet with shots of honey.\n\n\"Paul would go through half a bear a game,\" Johnson said.\n\nSkenes needed the pick-me-up to execute what he was trying to pull off: surviving a jump from the Mountain West Conference to the SEC, the best college baseball conference in the country. Even more important than his dietary changes -- which allowed him to maintain his weight during the season, a rarity -- were the efforts to help Skenes start throwing an effective breaking ball. He had thrived at Air Force with a fastball-changeup combination, but SEC hitters would pummel him without an effective spinner. He spent the winter working with Johnson on a slider, and scouts who went to see Skenes in Baton Rouge emerged suggesting something that once seemed inconceivable: He might be good enough to steal the top spot in the amateur draft from his teammate, outfielder Dylan Crews.\n\nSkenes spent the coming spring proving those scouts prophetic. Over 19 starts, he threw 122.2 innings and struck out 209 against 20 walks. In less than two years, he had become the most polished pitching prospect in a decade. All season, Skenes balanced otherworldly performance with an insatiable desire to learn more. Even as the slider emerged as an elite pitch, Skenes, after one particular start, told Johnson that while it was good enough to get out college hitters, it wouldn't have played in the big leagues.\n\n\"He's not hard on himself,\" said Johnson, now the head coach at the University of Georgia. \"He's just really good at self-evaluation.\"\n\nAt one point during the season that would end with Skenes winning the College World Series' Most Outstanding Player for the national champion Tigers, he asked to meet with Johnson to assess his progress. During the conversation, Johnson said, Skenes seemed to finally realize what would soon become clear to anyone watching him.\n\n\"I don't mean this to be arrogant,\" Skenes said. \"I think the only way I get beat is when I beat myself.\"\n\nTo make that harder to do, he picked up a few other pitches at LSU to complement his fastball and slider. To capitalize on his velocity, Skenes toyed around with a splinker -- a hybrid of a splitter and a sinker -- thrown by only one other pitcher, Twins closer Jhoan Duran. With his newfound feel for spin, he developed a curveball, too. While neither pitch fully formed in college, he kept working at them.\n\n\"What we're seeing, more than anything, is a remarkable desire to be very honest with information, very honest with feedback and very fast to adjust,\" Cherington said. \"I hate making comps. This is not a great comp because it's not the same type of player. But I've told people I believe Mookie Betts is the best practice player I've ever been around. Yes, he's talented, but specifically because he's so open to the truth and has such a comfortable relationship with, 'Oh, I'm not doing that well enough? Great. Give it to me so I can do something about it.'\n\n\"It sounds so simple, but it's very hard for people to do that. And we see some of that in Paul. Different players, different personalities, different people. But that relationship with the feedback he's getting about what his pitches are doing, what his delivery is doing, this is the target of where they want it to be. Those adjustments happen quickly.\"\n\nFOR THE BETTER part of a decade, the Pittsburgh Pirates have lived among the dregs of Major League Baseball. They are terminally parsimonious, running a bottom-five Opening Day payroll for the past seven seasons. Since Cherington took over as GM in November 2019, they've made organizational strides but never finished higher than fourth place in the National League Central division.\n\nTo win the inaugural draft lottery in 2022, then, was a gift for an organization that last made the postseason in 2015. On July 9, 2023, the Pirates chose Skenes over Crews and Florida outfielder Wyatt Langford with the first pick in the draft. After signing for a record $9.2 million bonus, Skenes threw 6.2 innings over five Low-A appearances that summer. They were glorified bullpen sessions following the grind of the college season, more an opportunity for Skenes to familiarize himself with the organization and vice versa.\n\nThe real work started last winter. The Pirates recognized that Skenes could have pitched effectively in the major leagues the day he was drafted, but they wondered whether sending him there to start the 2024 season would be best for his long-term development. Before it could figure out how best to deploy Skenes, the Pirates' front office needed to answer a question: What are we trying to accomplish?\n\n\"We took him 1-1. We really, really think highly of him,\" Cherington said. \"We're placing a very strong bet on him and have believed since the day we drafted him that he's going to be a really good major league starting pitcher. But pitching is hard to predict a week from now, let alone a year from now.\"\n\nWhat Pittsburgh landed on attempted to balance the future and the now. A drastic increase over his 122 innings from last year spooked the Pirates, even, as Cherington admits, \"there's an arbitrariness in that.\" Starting Skenes in the major leagues while throttling him could cause undue strain on the team's bullpen.\n\nBy sending Skenes to the minor leagues, the Pirates reasoned, they could see firsthand how he best operates and what he needs. He could introduce his splinker and curveball in an environment likelier to build confidence in the pitches. He could check a number of boxes progressively: efficiency in his early starts with limited pitch counts, game-planning as he was allowed to go through a lineup multiple times and stamina as he transitioned from five days' rest to the standard four in the major leagues. All while keeping his minor league innings totals low so they don't have to shut him down before the end of the season.\n\n\"We'd rather have the majority of the volume available to him be in the major leagues and not the minor leagues,\" Cherington said. \"Managing the volume progression early so it's building more slowly than an established major league starter's would, but in a way where we're not using an unnecessary number of innings in the minor leagues.\"\n\nThe plan made sense to Skenes. He's 21 years old. As tantalizing as pitching in the major leagues is, he's also patient enough to recognize the value of slow-playing his first full professional season. At the same time, because of the Pirates' miserly ways and general ineffectiveness -- they currently occupy last place in the NL Central at 17-21 -- the less-charitable read on the decision was that the team was manipulating Skenes' service time. By keeping Skenes in the minor leagues until 11, when he'll officially be called up for his debut, he will reach free agency after the 2030 season instead of 2029.\n\n\"I really don't believe it's played any role in this case. I really mean this,\" Cherington said. \"We decided in spring training that ... we wanted to build the volume more slowly than an established major league starter would. Once we made that decision, functionally, it has to start in the minor leagues.\"\n\nFROM THE MOMENT he started in Triple-A Indianapolis, it was evident Skenes did not belong there. In his first outing, he struck out five hitters in three perfect innings. He allowed two baserunners in his next start with six punchouts. He K'd eight hitters in each of his next two games, both with 3.1 scoreless innings. He allowed his first run in his fifth start, then stretched out in his sixth with six shutout innings on 75 pitches. At this point, every box is checked.\n\n\"Seriously, when I say he's pretty good, it's different. I ain't being dramatic,\" said reliever Brent Honeywell, who was with the Padres and White Sox last season and played in Indianapolis with Skenes this season. \"It's like, oh, he throws hard, he throws hard, he throws hard. Yeah, that s---'s cool and all, but the kid can flat-out pitch. Pitch. That dude paints. He throws it where it's intended to go, and I think it's the biggest thing that Paul Skenes does. He's got a cool fastball. His heater's really good. But that dude throws the ball where it's supposed to go.\"\n\nHoneywell is right. It's not just the fastball, which Skenes has thrown 46.9% of the time at an average of 100 mph on the dot. The splinker is a weapon, generating swings and misses 21% of the time as it sizzles up to 97 mph. Batters are hitting .158 against the slider. Five of the 11 curveballs Skenes has thrown have been on the first pitch, a surprise for anyone who dares sit fastball.\n\n\"The great ones have this ability to stretch their mind to these uncomfortable levels,\" Johnson said. \"That's why they don't give away at-bats. That's how they don't take pitches off. Paul already has that side of him. The Pirates knew what they were getting with the talent and body and raw numbers. But he's so advanced on that kind of stuff.\"\n\nKnowing that their time with him was nearing its end, Skenes' teammates in Indianapolis tried to enjoy the remaining moments. They'll miss his outlandish performances, sure, but also his baseball knowledge and sense of humor. Grant Koch, who caught the majority of Skenes' starts, had a running joke on days he didn't play. If a reliever needed to warm up, Koch would toss Skenes his catcher's mitt and say, within earshot of the coaching staff: \"Hey, Paul, go grab him for me real quick. I've got to go to the bathroom.\" The response, Koch said, from the coaches: \"No, no, no, no.\"\n\n\"When you're around people that are great and special at what they do, you learn a lot being around them,\" Koch said. \"Pitching and game-planning wise. Routine stuff. He takes his work very seriously. Hopefully I've made him comfortable and helped him in a way. But I'm appreciative of the time. It's been a cool experience.\"\n\nNot just for a player like Koch who has yet to make the big leagues but one like Honeywell who's angling to return. Six years ago, Honeywell was regarded as one of the best prospects in baseball, universally ranked among the game's 15 best. Though arm injuries waylaid Honeywell's ascent, he emerged with the sort of perspective that few understand.\n\nEveryone, Honeywell said, will want to get a hit off Skenes' fastball -- \"just to tell their friends they did it.\" And in the major leagues, where 29 pitchers this season have thrown 100 mph-plus fastballs, velocity doesn't play quite the same. It's necessary, he said, for Skenes to remember that as good as the fastball is, he's far more than one impressive pitch.\n\n\"He knows where he is going,\" Honeywell said. \"He knows where he is headed. He knows what his job's supposed to be. He goes about his business the right way. The kid just wants to pitch. And I think the kid was made to pitch.\"\n\nONE NEED ONLY consider the careers of previous pitching phenoms Mark Prior and Stephen Strasburg to see how wrong things can go for even seemingly the safest of pitching prospects.\n\nIn 2002, Prior blew through the minor leagues in 51 innings and threw another 116.2 that season. He jumped to 211.1 innings the next year and at 22 years old looked like baseball's next great ace. Arm injuries derailed his career. He threw his last big league pitch at 25.\n\nIn 2010, Strasburg was even better than Prior in 55.1 minor league innings and threw another 68 before he tore his ulnar collateral ligament and needed Tommy John surgery. He returned in late 2011 for five starts and cruised through 159.1 innings in 2012 before the Nationals shut him down three weeks before the postseason. On-and-off injuries limited him for the remainder of his career, and he threw his last meaningful pitch at 31.\n\nNow it's Skenes' turn. And it comes at a trying time for pitchers, when for all of the gains the sport has seen in maximizing pitching performance and velocity, keeping elite arms healthy remains a high-stakes crapshoot.\n\n\"The pitching ecosystem knows so much about how to optimize: the body, the delivery, the way the arm works, how fast guys move, creating force,\" Cherington said. \"What hasn't changed is the way the elbow and shoulder are built when you're born. We have way more data. We should be way more precise about what's going on.\"\n\nIt will be years before the Pirates know if the plan worked. And even if it does -- if Skenes stays healthy and turns into the next great ace -- the line from plan to success is neither clear nor causative.\n\nAs scary as the prospect of Skenes improving on the fly might be for the rest of the NL Central, it's what the Pirates need. Already this year they've added a hypertalented, hard-throwing, right-handed rookie to their rotation in Jared Jones. Pairing him with Skenes and right-hander Mitch Keller gives Pittsburgh the sort of starting staff that could be the envy of baseball sooner than later and perhaps convince owner Bob Nutting to push the Pirates' payroll past $100 million for the first time.\n\nCherington is quick not to get too far ahead of himself. He tries not to stress about the list of high-velocity pitchers and arm injuries. Shohei Ohtani isn't pitching this season because of reconstructive elbow surgery. Nor are Spencer Strider, Shane McClanahan, Sandy Alcantara and Eury Perez. Cole and Jesus Luzardo are out with elbow injuries, Grayson Rodriguez and Bobby Miller on the shelf with shoulder issues. That's nine of the 10 hardest-throwing starters in 2023 -- a spot Skenes and Jones are certain to fill in their absence.\n\n\"We don't know exactly the right way to manage it,\" Cherington said. \"We don't. We want to win games, and they give us a chance to make that happen. In most cases, we'd really like to have models that really inform our decisions. And then humans can stress those models and push them left and right. In this case, we don't have a model telling us.\"\n\nAhead they forge nevertheless, unclear if their plan was right, praying things don't go wrong. Such is life in modern baseball, where you never know. You simply hope.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_passan@espn.com", "name": "Jeff Passan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nOlivia Dunne was over the moon for her boyfriend, Paul Skenes, as the top prospect in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization was called up to the big leagues after less than a year in the minors.\n\nSkenes got the call on Wednesday as he dominated at Triple-A Indianapolis in his first few starts. The Pirates selected Skenes with the No. 1 pick in the MLB Draft last year.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nDunne and Skenes revealed their couple status late last year, and the LSU gymnast has been teasing in recent days that the pitcher would get called up. She posted a video on TikTok about how they found out he was getting the call to the major league mound.\n\n\"POV: you both wake up from a nap and find out he's in the MLB,\" she screen-capped her clip.\n\n\"... here we go,\" she added on her Instagram Stories.\n\nHe did make that start against the Buffalo Bisons on Monday, but it did not go according to plan. Skenes gave up his first home run of the year to Will Robertson, though he ended up striking out four batters and being pulled after 66 pitches.\n\nStill, the Pirates like what they see.\n\nYANKEES' GIANCARLO STANTON DEMOLISHES HOME RUN AT ALMOST 120 MPH FOR MLB'S HARDEST HIT OF 2024\n\n\"He's been checking just about every box since the season started and responding incredibly well,\" Pirates GM Ben Cherington told Audacy's 93.7 \"The Fan\" on Sunday.\n\nSkenes has been mowing down the competition at Triple-A and owned a 0.99 ERA over his first seven starts despite Monday's hiccup.\n\nSkenes has given up just 17 hits over 27.1 innings with three earned runs allowed. He has also struck out 45 batters while walking eight.\n\nNot only is Skenes the Pirates' top prospect, but MLB.com has him ranked the No. 3 prospect in all baseball after he finished with a 13-2 record during LSU's College World Series run in 2023. He was a shoo-in to be drafted first overall by the Pirates, and they gave him a record $9.2 million signing bonus when he inked his first contract.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSo, it will not just be Pirates fans looking out for May 11 at PNC Park in Pittsburgh.

He will also add some excitement to the loyal fan base.\n\n\"I can't wait to win,\" Skenes said when he was drafted. \"I am excited to be a Pirate. I'm excited to be part of the group that wins another World Series.\"\n\nSkenes joins an exciting group of young players in Major League Baseball. The league's new rising stars include Gunnar Henderson (Baltimore Orioles and 2023 AL Rookie of the Year), Elly De La Cruz (Cincinnati Reds), Anthony Volpe (New York Yankees), Jordan Westburg (Orioles), Patrick Bailey (San Francisco Giants), Javier Assad (Chicago Cubs), and Bryce Miller (Seattle Mariners).\n\nThe positional players provide a unique blend of speed and power. The pitchers have the potential to dominate a lineup.\n\nSkenes was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 MLB Draft. He is the third-ranked in MLB behind Orioles shortstop Jackson Holliday and Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Jackson Chourio.\n\nSkenes has drawn comparisons to former Washington Nationals and three-time All-Star pitcher Stephen Strasburg and has a fastball that can reach 102 mph. Skenes also has solid command and can consistently find the strike zone and allowed just eight walls this season in the minors.\n\nSkenes was the consensus top pick in the MLB draft after a dazzling career at LSU.\n\nIn 2023, he was named the National Player of the Year by Collegiate Baseball and by D1 Baseball. Skenes also became the first Tigers player to win the SEC Pitcher of the Year since Aaron Nola won the award in 2013 and 2014.\n\nSkenes was also dominant in the postseason and was named the Most Outstanding Player of the 2023 College World Series after going 1-0 with a 1.15 ERA in two starts (15.2 innings). He allowed two runs on seven hits with two walks and 21 strikeouts.\n\nSkenes finished No. 1 in the nation in strikeouts (209), in strikeouts per nine innings (15.33) and WHIP (0.75). He finished No. 2 nationally in ERA (1.69), No. 3 in strikeout-to-walk ratio (10.45), and No. 5 in hits allowed per nine innings (5.28).\n\n\"We took him 1-1. We really, really think highly of him,\" Pirates general manager Ben Cherington said. \"We're placing a very strong bet on him and have believed since the day we drafted him that he's going to be a really good major league starting pitcher. But pitching is hard to predict a week from now, let alone a year from now.\"\n\nThe main goal is to stay atop the standings and make a deep run in the postseason where Pittsburgh has not played since 2015.\n\nThe Pirates are a storied franchise with 42 former players, managers, and executives in the Hall of Fame.

He is set to make his pitching debut for the Pirates on Saturday.\n\nSkenes, who was the No. 1 overall draft pick out of LSU in 2023, has been completely dominant in Triple-A this year.

Thanks to his talent with the ball in his hand, as well as a fastball that can reach triple digits, Skenes has one of the highest ceilings in the MLB.\n\nSkenes has been linked to a number of superstar pitchers who dominated the MLB during their primes, including Stephen Strasburg, Gerrit Cole, and David Price. If he can reach their heights (and potentially even higher) he could become one of the best in the league.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lyndon_suvanto@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Lyndon Suvanto", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Skenes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Skenes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Strasburg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Strasburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dansby_Swanson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dansby Swanson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_Cole", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gerrit Cole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Price_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Price (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Bellinger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cody Bellinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Happ", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ian Happ"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Modified_Pitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Modified Pitch", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/8045c-17152060464198-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547286", "eventUri": "eng-9547286", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 1435, "textEnd": 1443}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

But apparently, national champion LSU gymnast Olivia Dunne knows more about her boyfriend than Shelton does.\n\n\"Here we go,\" Dunne said on an Instagram post Wednesday.\n\nPaul Skenes, the first player picked in the 2023 Major League Baseball draft last July by Pittsburgh after pitching LSU to the national championship, was called up from Triple-A Indianapolis to the Big Show by the Pirates on Wednesday. He is expected to start for Pittsburgh on Saturday at home against the Chicago Cubs (4:05 p.m., MLB.tv).\n\n\"He's scheduled to pitch in Indy this week,\" Shelton said incorrectly on Monday and added that he had not spoken \"in any form or fashion\" to anyone about Skenes pitching this week for the Pirates.\n\n\"There was speculation that he was going to pitch in this series or (on Sunday),\" Shelton said. \"I think when you have someone that's talented like he is, there's always going to be speculation. People are always going to have it figured out. Well, we haven't figured it out yet.\"\n\nRare Air: Paul Skenes An Elite Pitcher, But He Wants To Fly Jets\n\nBut maybe Livvy Dunne, who began dating Skenes more than a year ago, already had.\n\nOn Sunday she posted a Pirates jersey on her SnapChat account. Pittsburgh radio talk show how Andrew Fillipponi of 93.7 FM The Fan posted the jersey on his X account.\n\nSo, Livvy wins. Now, it's Paul's turn.\n\nSkenes had expressed frustration just recently about being brought along too slowly. He will have his chance in the Big Leagues after ripping up Triple-A through seven starts this season as he compiled a phenomenal 0.99 earned run average with no decisions. He struck out 45 in just 27 and a third innings. His WHIP (walks and hits per inning) was also a minuscule 0.91, and he allowed a .175 batting average.\n\nRELATED: Paul Skenes On Fast Track\n\nIn all, he gave up 17 hits and three earned runs with eight walks, one home run, one wild pitch and zero balks with Indianapolis. On Sunday in his most recent start for Indianapolis, he allowed three hits, two runs, including a home run, and two walks with four strikeouts in four and one-third innings in a 66-pitch no-decision that Indians won, 8-3, over Buffalo.\n\nThat was his first game on only four days of rest, though. The previous Tuesday, Skenes delivered, striking out seven in a six-inning shutout around a walk and four hits as he threw a pro career-high 75 pitches with 53 strikes as the Indians beat Buffalo, 4-3.\n\nSkenes was 13-2 with a 1.69 ERA with 209 strikeouts in 122 and two-thirds innings for LSU in the 2023 season. He broke the Southeastern Conference record for strikeouts in a season that was 202 in 1989 by Ben McDonald, who was the first pick of the draft that year by Baltimore. Skenes also led the nation in strikeouts per nine innings at LSU with 15.3 last season. He was striking out 14.8 per nine innings this season.\n\nAfter the Pirates took him with the first pick of the draft, he was 0-0 with a 5.40 ERA on three Pirates' minor league teams later that summer. Through six and two-thirds innings, he struck out 10 with two walks around five hits and four runs allowed in 2023 with the Pirates' organization.\n\n\"He's been checking just about every box since the season started,\" Pirates' general manager Ben Cherington said this week. \"And responding incredibly well.\"", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors":

Lots of honey.\n\nAhead of highly anticipated Skenes' Major League Baseball debut with the Pittsburgh Pirates on Saturday, it was revealed that the sport's top pitching prospect can go through half a jar of honey per start.\n\n'Paul would go through half a bear a game,' an LSU staffer told ESPN, in reference to the typical plastic bear-shaped jars of bottled honey.\n\nHow big the jar in question was for Skenes' dominant days as a Tiger is unclear, but the plastic honey jars could have up to one pound of the sweet substance.\n\nSkenes has been pitching for the Pirates Triple-A affiliate, the Indianapolis Indians, fanning hitters one level below the big leagues.\n\nSkenes consistently throws fastballs of over 100 miles per hour, fanning tons of hitters\n\nSkenes is in a relationship with LSU gymnast Olivia Dunne after meeting as student-athletes\n\nThe Pirates started the season 11-8, but have since slipped to 17-21 overall, turning to Skenes to inject early life into what could become another mediocre season for the franchise.\n\nSkenes' status as a game-changer for Pittsburgh comes from the statistics that no starting pitcher in the history of the league has thrown as fast for as long during stints as he does.\n\nDuring a recent start against the St. Paul Saints, the Triple-A affiliate of the Minnesota Twins, Skenes threw 34 pitches of 100 miles per hour or greater in 3.1 innings of work.\n\nThe right-hander's potential is through the roof after a stellar career at LSU, where he met Dunne.\n\nThe two had long tried to keep their romance under wraps, but confirmed their relationship on social media last summer.\n\nSkenes signed a $9.2million bonus when joining the Pirates to go along with Dunne being the highest-earning female collegiate athlete due to NIL deals.\n\nSkenes is rated as the No 3 prospect in all of baseball, two spots ahead of Texas Rangers star Wyatt Langford, who has played an integral role for the defending World Series champions.\n\nThe Pirates have won one playoff series, a 2013 Wild Card tilt, since their 1979 championship with Willie Stargell leading the way.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType":

They drafted him as the consensus No. 1 pick in the 2023 MLB entry draft. With that, they handed him a signing bonus worth $9.2 million.\n\nThey were careful with him, not letting him skip any steps in the developmental process. But he raced through all levels of the minor leagues, making his way to Double-A last season.\n\nThis season, the Pirates let him loose in Triple-A Indianapolis, where he continued to dominate. Through seven starts (27 1/3 innings) this season, Skenes holds a 0.99 ERA. He's struck out 45 batters and walked just eight of them. Skenes also holds a blistering 0.915 WHIP.\n\nSkenes is known as a power pitcher. Close to 25% of his pitches this season have reached 100+ miles per hour. He throws his top pitch --- his fastball --- 46.9% of the time at a burning 99.9 mph average. His secondary pitches include a slider, split-finger, changeup and curveball.\n\nHe's been earmarked as a generational pitcher since his college days at LSU, where he led his team to a national championship last summer.

Pirates right-hander Paul Skenes will make his highly anticipated MLB debut this Saturday in a home outing against the visiting Cubs, the the team announced.\n\nThe 6'6'', 235-pound Skenes is the embodiment of a prototypical, power-armed ace. He's widely regarded as one of the top pitching prospects in the sport -- if not the top pitching prospect. Pittsburgh selected him with the top pick in last year's draft after Skenes posted a 2.18 ERA and fanned more than 36% of his opponents in a three-year college career that included two seasons with the Air Force Academy and a third with the eventual national champion Louisiana State University Tigers. Skenes posted a comical 1.69 ERA over the course of 122 innings, striking out a hair over 45% of his opponents.\n\nYou won't find a scouting report on Skenes that doesn't laud him as a potential perennial All-Star and front-of-the-rotation pitcher with Cy Young upside. His fastball sits in the upper 90s and can reach 102 mph. Baseball America, MLB.com and FanGraphs all give him credit for a plus-plus (70-grade) fastball on the 20-80 scale, with MLB.com even pegging as an 80-grade pitch. His slider draws similar praise.\n\nThe Athletic's Keith Law notes that Skenes' four-seam/slider combo was so dominant in college that he needed to work on his seldom-used changeup and a two-seamer in order to reach his ace-level ceiling. He's worked to incorporate both into his repertoire more regularly in Triple-A this year. ESPN's Kiley McDaniel lists Skenes alongside David Price, Gerrit Cole and Stephen Strasburg as one of the four best pitching prospects in the past 20 years of the MLB draft.\n\nTo this point in his young career, Skenes has done nothing to suggest the hype is unwarranted. He's made seven starts in Triple-A -- the Pirates have limited his per-outing workload, leaving him at 27 1/3 innings on the season -- and posted a 0.99 ERA with an over-the-moon 42.9% strikeout rate against a 7.6% walk rate. Skenes has kept the ball on the ground at a 51% clip and yielded just one homer all season. Though Pittsburgh has ramped him up in quite cautious fashion, he's now been up to six innings in a start, so he should be able to work relatively deep into his debut effort if his performance dictates.\n\nSkenes' ascension to the Pirates' rotation comes at a time when fellow rookie Jared Jones looks well on his way to becoming a high-end rotation arm himself. The 22-year-old Jones entered the season as a top-100 prospect himself and has raced out to a brilliant start: 2.63 ERA, 33.8% strikeout rate, 3.2% walk rate in 41 innings.\n\nIn an ideal setting, that electric young duo will join stalwart righty Mitch Keller, who signed a five-year extension during spring training, in forming the core of the Bucs' rotation for years to come. Veteran Martin Perez is holding down one of the rotation spots behind that trio for now, but he's only on a one-year contract. Fellow southpaw Marco Gonzales entered the season in the rotation as well, but he's since gone down with a forearm strain. The Pirates are surely hopeful that some combination of Quinn Priester, Luis Ortiz, Anthony Solometo, Bubba Chandler and Tom Harrington can break through in the majors and form a homegrown rotation that can thrust the team into perennial contention.\n\nThe timing of Skenes' promotion comes at a point when enough time has elapsed that he can't accrue a full year of big league service time -- at least not by conventional means. There will only be 143 days remaining in the season by the time he debuts, leaving him well shy of the requisite 172 for a year of service. However, under the prospect promotion incentives in the 2022-26 collective bargaining agreement, Skenes could still gain a full year of service if he finishes in the top two of National League Rookie of the Year voting.\n\nIn the event that Skenes achieves that feat, he'd have five additional years of club control, meaning he wouldn't be eligible for free agency until the 2029-30 offseason and wouldn't reach arbitration eligibility until the 2026-27 offseason. If Skenes sticks in the big leagues but does not gain a year of service based on Rookie of the Year voting, he'd be under club control through the 2030 season. However, the timing of his promotion also leaves him as a surefire Super Two player in that scenario, meaning he'd still be arb-eligible following the 2026 campaign and would go through the arbitration process four times rather than the standard three.", "source": {"uri": "mlbtraderumors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MLB Trade Rumors"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He struck out 45 batters in 27 innings, setting the stage for one of the most anticipated major league debuts in the past decade.\n\nSkenes commanded national attention during his first CWS start last year, when 46 of the 123 pitches he threw registered at least 100 mph. In his seven Class AAA starts this season, he averaged 99.9 mph on his fastball; he also puts away hitters with a split-finger fastball that averages nearly 95 mph.\n\nLittle wonder he struck out 209 batters in 122 2/3 innings at LSU last year.\n\nHard to imagine now, but Skenes began his college career as a two-way player, playing catcher at Air Force while also fulfilling closer duties.\n\nYet as his career unfolded, his velocity only grew and after his sophomore year at Air Force -- after which he would have been required to commit to a five-year military hitch -- he transferred to LSU.\n\nTwo things awaited there: Significant recompense with the school's Name, Image and Likeness connections, and pitching coach Wes Johnson. Johnson remade Skenes' mechanics over the course of a fall and winter and, by spring 2023, unleashed a monster.\n\nQuite well. Fellow rookie Jared Jones has been a revelation this season, posting a 2.63 ERA in seven starts, 2023 All-Star Mitch Keller is signed through 2028 and Quinn Priester retains promise. But veterans Marco Gonzales and Martin Perez were viewed largely as stopgaps; Gonzales is on the injured list with a forearm strain and Perez, who posted a 2.55 ERA through four starts, has a 5.40 ERA in his last four outings.\n\nCorrespondingly, the Pirates won 10 of their first 14 games, but are just 7-17 since. They're in fourth place, five games behind division-leading Milwaukee in the National League Central.\n\nIt should be. Skenes has only spent a skant few days in the city after he was drafted, but is used to the spotlight. Baton Rouge is mad about its sports -- LSU has led the NCAA in attendance 25 times since 1996.\n\nAnd his girlfriend, LSU gymnast Livvy Dunne, might be the most popular athlete connected to a Pittsburgh team. She's amassed more than 10 million social media followers on Instagram and TikTok, and shared the Pirates' hype video for Skenes' call-up Wednesday on her stories.\n\nOf course, he'll have to perform to validate the hype. For now, though, Skenes' arrival evokes a similar anticipation to Stephen Strasburgh's 2010 debut with the Washington Nationals -- when he struck out 14.\n\nSaturday, Skenes begins crafting his own

The Pirates announced Wednesday that Paul Skenes will start Saturday's game against the Cubs.\n\nI'd say to pick him up, but he's already rostered in 90 percent of CBS Sports leagues. By that metric, Skenes might be the most highly anticipated pitcher prospect ever.\n\nThe Pirates had previously said he'd get another turn at Triple-A but apparently had a change of heart. He's made a mockery of that level so far by allowing three earned runs and striking out 45 in 27 1/3 innings.\n\nPaul Skenes P PIT Pittsburgh * #30 * Age: 21 2024 Minors ERA 0.99 WHIP 0.92 INN 27.1 BB 8 K 45\n\nWhile his slider is considered his best pitch, what stands out most on a pure statistical level is how consistently he pumps in his fastball at triple digits. He's about to set a new standard as far as that goes, at least among starting pitchers. He's already thrown 98 pitches 100 mph or harder at Triple-A, according to MLB.com, which is more than any major-leaguer this year. And remember, Skenes' starts have all been on the shorter side, with the longest lasting 75 pitches.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point, the downside case. The timing of this promotion is curious in that Skenes is coming off his one start that was slightly less dominant (two earned runs in 4 1/3 innings), which itself wouldn't matter except that it was his first time starting on four days' rest. That's customary in a five-man rotation, but you could tell he wasn't accustomed to it. His stuff wasn't up to its usual standards, and he went on to serve up his first home run on his second-slowest fastball of the season. The truth is that a 75-pitch max isn't a thorough exploration of how well a pitcher's stuff holds up. It's one thing to dominate in four-inning bursts, but it's another to do it in a true starting role.\n\nMy concerns for Skenes are twofold:\n\nIs he truly ready to handle a major-league workload?To what extent will he be allowed to try?\n\nObviously, the Pirates have coddled him to this point, limiting him to three innings in spring training and roughly three innings in each of his first four Triple-A starts. My presumption is that it was a delayed buildup, reflecting their preference to limit his innings at the start of the season rather than the end. But the fact he took a step back in his latest start, both in terms of buildup and performance, makes me wonder if the plan is so well thought out.\n\nThe stuff is overpowering enough that, inning for inning, I have few concerns about whether Skenes will be good on an inning-for-inning basis. But if he's not able to go six innings consistently -- or even the five required for a win -- there's only so much good he can do in Fantasy.\n\nSo where does that put Skenes in terms of the rankings? Well, I don't think it's a stretch to say he has top-10 potential already, and that potential needs to be factored in. But potential isn't inevitability, of course, and so weighing it against my concerns over his workload and sustainability, I would put Skenes around ... 25th. Honestly, that's higher than I thought, particularly at a time when there seems to be a surplus of quality pitching. But I guess most of that quality pitching comes with question marks, as does Skenes, and if there are question marks either way, why not shoot for the best possible outcome?\n\nSo if you can capitalize on the hype of Skenes' promotion by combining him with a lesser player for a true top-15 arm -- say, Pablo Lopez or Kevin Gausman -- go for it. But otherwise, you should just sit back and enjoy the ride.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_white@cbssports.com", "name": "Scott White", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Strasburg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Strasburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MLB.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Gausman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Gausman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/09/f27acdab-778f-4686-a655-50847ac323f9/thumbnail/1200x675/863ca19e1655c0eaed2abddad6883ec2/paul-skenes-getty-images.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547286", "eventUri": "eng-9547286", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

He's also got a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 45:8 in that same span. How is he expected to fare at the major league level?\n\nFanDuel Sportsbook BET $5, WIN $200 BONUS BETS!

The pitcher he gets compared to most often because of the LSU ties, Ben McDonald, made his debut 96 days after he was drafted. However, Skenes could very well be the most MLB-ready of the bunch with incredible command and a fastball that touches triple digits.\n\nHe's an early contender for National League Rookie of the Year, despite some other players getting nearly a month and a half head start. FanDuel Sportsbook lists Skenes at 17/1 to win the award. He's got the seventh-best odds behind Shota Imanaga (+190), Yoshinobu Yamamoto (+380), Jared Jones (+650), Michael Busch (+950), Andy Pages (+950) and Jackson Merrill (+1200).\n\nIf you're feeling a bit riskier, Skenes is a long shot to win the National League Cy Young award at 200/1. He's got the joint-lowest odds available to bet at FanDuel, which should come as no surprise. Only one pitcher in MLB history has ever won the Cy Young Award during their rookie season: Fernando Valenzuela of the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1981.\n\nSkenes will be looking to help guide the Pirates to the postseason for the first time since 2015. Pittsburgh is currently 17-21, five games back of the division-leading Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nOddsmakers are giving the Pirates an outside chance of accomplishing much of anything this season. They have the longest odds to win the National League Central at +1700, a lot further back than the fourth-ranked contender, the Cincinnati Reds, at +600. Pittsburgh is also +790 to make the playoffs and +26000 to win the World Series for the first time since 1979.\n\nWhile Skenes may not elevate the team in the short term, he's an essential building block for the franchise's future. Saturday's first pitch is slated for 3:05 p.m. at PNC Park in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.", "source": {"uri": "theadvocate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Advocate"}, "authors": [{"uri":

What to know about Pirates prospect and his 100 mph fastball before MLB debut - CBSSports.com", "body": "Skenes, the No. 1 pick in last year's draft, will make his MLB debut Saturday against the Cubs Getty Images\n\nPaul Skenes, the No. 1 pick in last summer's draft by way of LSU, had become the subject of weekly check-ins over the season's first month-plus. Everyone who has seen Skenes, and who has become enamored with his extreme brand of power pitching, had the same inquiry on their mind: when, oh when, will the Pirates promote him? We got the official answer on Wednesday.\n\nSkenes is being called up by the Pirates and will make his MLB debut on Saturday against the Cubs.\n\nSkenes made seven starts in Triple-A this year, amassing a 0.99 ERA and a 5.63 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 27 1/3 innings. He's struck out 42.9% of the batters he's faced thus far this season, suggesting that he is more than ready for his promotion.\n\nTo honor Skenes' call-up, and to indulge in everyone's blooming fascination with him, we've answered four pertinent questions about him and his game below. Those questions include what makes him so notable, why he's remained in the majors, and when we think he'll debut. Now, let's get to it.\n\n1. What makes Skenes so notable?\n\nIn our estimation, Skenes' mainstream appeal can be attributed to a confluence of factors. He throws extremely hard. He was the No. 1 pick in last summer's draft after playing ball for a prestigious program. He throws extremely hard. He's part of a power couple. And did we note that he throws extremely hard? Velocity sells, baby; always has, always will.\n\nBeyond that, Skenes was something of a polarizing prospect in last summer's draft. CBS Sports spoke to several scouts and analysts who did not consider him the best choice at the top of the draft because of reasons we outlined at the time:\n\nSkenes is an imposing figure with upper-90s velocity and a strikeout rate near 48% against SEC hitters. About 15 years ago, that would've been enough to land him higher on this list (and the belief is he might go as early as No. 2 overall, with several sources identifying him as the Nationals' kind of pitcher). Those within the industry are convinced that ball-tracking data has improved their ability to evaluate pitches. Those advancements have made Skenes a divisive figure, with scouts and analysts who spoke to CBS Sports expressing reservations about his fastball shape. The short version is that his four-seamer features minimal separation between its induced vertical break and its horizontal break, putting it in the \"dead zone.\" The fear is Skenes' four-seamer will play down as a result, causing him to underperform draft night expectations. Consider Nathan Eovaldi, another big-armed righty with minimal separation; prior to this year, opponents had hit .300 or better against his fastball in three consecutive seasons. Skenes' velocity may mitigate some of the effect, and it's possible his employer will help him find a better shape, or will have him shift to his sinker (his current one features more run than Dustin May's). Factor in the probabilistic analysis argument that arises whenever a pitcher is part of a class loaded with good hitters, and that's why he's lower than you might have expected, even if he still goes No. 2.\n\nThe Pirates took Skenes at No. 1 anyway, suggesting they weren't too concerned about his perceived flaws. Fair enough. We bring it up only because it's an undeniable part of contemporary human life that friction, if only the possibility of it, attracts attention. We think Skenes would've captured the Collective Imagination regardless -- have you heard he throws extremely hard? -- but consider this extra fuel on the flame.\n\n2. Anything else to know about Skenes' arsenal?\n\nFirst, let's lay out Skenes' arsenal. So far this season, he's thrown what amounts to five pitches: a four-seam fastball, a sinker, and a slider form the backbone of his repertoire. He's also sprinkled in some changeups and curveballs, but even combined they represent less than 10% of his usage so we're going to ignore them in this section.\n\nSkenes' four-seamer averages 100 mph, which would make it the hottest in the majors among starters. The only pitcher to throw 50 or more four-seamers this season and top Skenes' average velocity is Oakland Athletics closer Mason Miller (100.8 mph). That Skenes is able to maintain such heat is a testament to how special he is physically.\n\nWe mentioned above that Skenes' fastball shape has raised some eyebrows. Past research has found that fastballs that have similar vertical and horizontal break are easier for hitters to track, causing them to play less effectively than expected. Skenes' fastball has averaged 13.4 inches of induced vertical break and 14.3 inches of horizontal break, providing little separation between the two planes.\n\n(Stats from Skenes' first six MiLB starts this year)\n\nPitchUsage%VelocityAverage EVWhiff%\n\nFour-seamer\n\n46.9%\n\n100 mph\n\n85.4 mph\n\n34%\n\nSlider\n\n25.3%\n\n86.5 mph\n\n82.9 mph\n\n44.2%\n\nSinker\n\n18%\n\n94.8 mph\n\n81.0 mph\n\n38.2%\n\nWill that matter? There's a school of thought that says no, because of Skenes' elite velocity and above-average control. There's also a school of thought that says it might -- just look at Hunter Greene and Nathan Eovaldi, two power righties who have had solid careers, albeit, perhaps, while underperforming compared to the gaudy velocity they generate on their fastballs. That first school of thought has been correct so far. We can only wait and see if it proves to be the case at the big-league level.\n\nSkenes' most-used secondary pitch is an 86.5 mph slider that served as his outpitch at LSU. He generates close to seven inches of glove-side break and around seven inches of induced vertical break. If you're looking for a MLB comparison, those numbers are similar to what Tampa Bay Rays right-hander Ryan Pepiot generates on his own slider.\n\nThen there's the sinker, a new addition to his arsenal that has inspired comparisons to Minnesota Twins' closer Jhoan Duran's splinker -- that is a splitter-sinker hybrid. Some pitch classification models are calling it a splitter; Skenes told our Matt Snyder that it's just a sinker in his mind.\n\nWhatever you call it, the pitch generates 15 inches of arm-side break and 0.6 inches of induced vertical break. There are exactly three pitchers who throw sinkers that have at least 14 inches of arm-side break and two inches or fewer of induced vertical break: Yannier Cano, Tanner Houck, and Logan Webb. That's pretty good company to keep.\n\nTo state the obvious, having three quality pitches is better than having two quality pitches. We think it's fair to assume that Skenes' sinker changes the dynamic of his arsenal in a way that should help mitigate whatever (if any) ill effects his four-seamer's shape has on its effectiveness. He now has three legitimate weapons to use, each having shown a capacity for missing bats and evading barrels. There aren't many pitchers, in the majors or anywhere else, with that kind of power arsenal.\n\n3. How good could Skenes be?\n\nIn the magical world of baseball scouting parlance, you have what evaluators refer to as dudes and and you have what they refer to as Dudes. A dude is just a guy; a Dude is The Man. Got it? Good, because Skenes certainly has the look of a Dude. In layman's terms, he could well become a No. 1 or 2 starter. (And before anyone yells at us for daring to suggest he won't be a No. 1, mind you that that designation is reserved for fewer than a dozen pitchers; there's no shame in being the 13th or 14th or 17th best starting pitcher in all of MLB.)\n\nNow, no one can guarantee that Skenes is going to become the new Gerrit Cole. Baseball just doesn't work like that. Sometimes players fail to meet expectations; other times it takes them longer than expected to live up to their promise. Heck, Cole himself is a good example of that: he was the No. 1 pick in the 2011 draft, yet he didn't make an All-Star Game or receive a Cy Young Award vote until his third season, when he was 24. He then didn't accomplish either of those feats again until his age-27 campaign.\n\nFor another example of how Skenes' career could play out, consider Stephen Strasburg. Everyone undoubtedly remembers how he came into the majors with as much hype as any pitcher in recent memory; how he got hurt; how he then inspired nonstop discourse when the Washington Nationals shut him down early in 2012; and so on. Anyway, Strasburg made his first All-Star Game at 23, and received his first Cy Young Award consideration at age 25. He didn't repeat either feat until his age-27 season.\n\nThe Pirates can only hope that Skenes can achieve the heights that Cole and Strasburg have without enduring either years of underperformance or injury. Do you hear that? It sounds like a convenient segue opportunity.\n\n4. Why wasn't Skenes already in the majors?\n\nTo put it in a sentence: the Pirates have taken a very conservative approach to Skenes' workload. He didn't pitch into the fifth inning as a professional until three starts ago.\n\nSkenes was used aggressively last year at LSU, throwing 122 innings and clearing the 100-pitch mark more than 40% of the time. That percentage, by the way, was well beyond those of his peers. The Pirates have veered in the other direction. Hence Skenes tallying all of 29 innings across his first 11 professional starts.\n\nYou might question the wisdom of Pittsburgh's approach, or the potential effectiveness of it -- you'll never go broke betting on any and every individual pitcher getting hurt at some point. Still, it's hard to blame the Pirates for trying to keep their talented young pitcher healthy at a time when the league is dealing with an arm-injury epidemic.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_j_anderson@cbssports.com", "name": "R.J.

Pittsburgh limited his workload after a taxing junior season at LSU in which he struck out 209 hitters and walked just 20 in 122 2/3 innings while going 13-2 with a 1.69 ERA.\n\nWhile evaluators believed Skenes to be major league-ready when Pittsburgh drafted him, the Pirates entered 2024 wanting to build him up slowly and avoid a potential midseason pullback on his innings. By limiting Skenes' pitch count in the minor leagues -- he hasn't thrown more than 75 pitches in a Triple-A start this year -- the Pirates hope he can join a rotation that also includes hard-throwing rookie Jared Jones for the remainder of the season.\n\nHow to handle elite pitching prospects has long been a mystery for front offices, particularly with the proliferation of arm injuries to hard-throwing starters this season. The two closest facsimiles to Skenes in terms of college production and major league readiness were Washington Nationals right-hander Stephen Strasburg and Chicago Cubs right-hander Mark Prior, both of whom were brilliant for flashes in the big leagues but ultimately had their careers shortened by arm injuries.\n\nAt 6-foot-6 and 235 pounds, Skenes assumes the mantle as the hardest-throwing starter in the game -- and perhaps the highest-velocity rotation piece in baseball history. At Triple-A Indianapolis, Skenes' four-seam fastball has reached over 102.1 mph. He also mixed in a splinker -- a combination splitter and sinker thrown by Minnesota Twins closer Jhoan Duran -- at 95 mph, complemented it with a mid-to-high-80s slider, added a softer changeup that runs at 88 mph and occasionally turned to a slower curve.\n\nWhile the Pirates currently occupy last place in the National League Central, it's more due to their hitting than a strong set of arms. Few starters in the NL have been as impressive as the 22-year-old Jones, and with Skenes joining veterans Mitch Keller, Martin Perez and Bailey Falter, the Pirates now have arguably the best rotation in the division.", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_Falter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bailey Falter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Keller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Keller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mart\u00edn_P\u00e9rez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mart\u00edn P\u00e9rez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Prior", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Prior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Strasburg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Strasburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-seam_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Four-seam fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-finger_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Split-finger fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Changeup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0229%2Fr1298200_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547286", "eventUri": "eng-9547286", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Exploring details surrounding Pirates prospect's 'splinker' added to repertoire", "body": "The Pittsburgh Pirates' promising prospect, Paul Skenes, is all set to make his major league debut this week. The team is calling up their No. 1 rookie to start against the Chicago Cubs on Saturday.\n\nSkenes briefly appeared for the Pirates during this year's spring training season. He played in two games, had a single start, and earned a run in three innings. Soon after, he was optioned to Triple-A, where he played for Indianapolis.\n\nHe has a stunning 0.99 ERA in seven starts, pitching for 27.1 innings in the minors. During that time, Skenes developed a new pitch called 'Splinker' as a surprise gift for his competitors in the majors.\n\nKeith Law of The Athletic has gone into deep detail in his recent article about Skenes' newly developed pitch, which could be his key to success in the big league.\n\nAccording to Law, Splinker is a mix of two of the most effective pitches: splitter and sinker. However, it has a completely different effect on the hitters than either of them. The pitch appears like a fastball when it leaves the hand, but when it approaches the catcher's mitt, it slows by five mph and sinks 13 inches more than a four-seamer.\n\nThe Triple-A hitters have struggled against Skenes' \"splinkers.\" Whereas batters missed nearly 30% of his four-seamer, with splinker, they got beaten almost 33% of the time.\n\nNot to mention, Skenes has a lethal four-seamer that can touch up to 102 mph, along with a slider, curveball, splitter, and change-ups, with which he can dominate the game.\n\nHowever, the 22-year-old starter has to be careful as the gap between majors and minors is huge, which was personally experienced by one of his rivals, Jackson Holliday. Holliday debuted for the Baltimore Orioles last month. However, he struggled badly, forcing the O's to option him back to the minors.\n\nSkenes seems to be in perfect form to make his debut. Also, he'll have to avoid injuries to live up to his reputation as 2023's no 1 overall draft pick.\n\nPirates don't want to hold on to their promising prospect despite the injury crisis in the league\n\nAmid the injury crisis among the pitchers in the league, the Pittsburgh Pirates made a bold decision to call-up their top prospect, Paul Skenes, to start against the Cubs in the big league.\n\nBen Cherington, the Pirates' general manager, shared that they don't want to hinder the development progress of Skenes, despite the injury possibility.\n\n\"I don't claim that we have any sort of scientific master formula for how we're doing this,\" said Cherington, via ESPN. \"I don't know for sure that this plan is right. I can't say that.\"\n\nEntering Thursday, the Pirates have a 17-21 record in NL Central, following the Chicago Cubs (22-16) and Milwaukee Brewers (21-15). After losing their series to the Los Angeles Angels, they will try to get a win against the Cubs at PNC Park before Skenes' joining.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sayan_dam@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Sayan Dam", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Skenes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Skenes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-seam_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Four-seam fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-finger_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Split-finger fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curveball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Curveball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PNC Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Cherington", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Cherington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Modified_Pitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Modified Pitch", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/cd995-17152786219789-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547286", "eventUri": "eng-9547286", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

They drafted him as the consensus No. 1 pick in the 2023 MLB entry draft. With that, they handed him a signing bonus worth $9.2 million.\n\nThey were careful with him, not letting him skip any steps in the developmental process. But he raced through all levels of the minor leagues, making his way to Double-A last season.\n\nThis season, the Pirates let him loose in Triple-A Indianapolis, where he continued to dominate. Through seven starts (27.1 innings) this season, Skenes holds a 0.99 ERA. He's struck out 45 batters and walked just eight of them. Skenes also holds a blistering 0.915 WHIP.\n\nSkenes is known as a power pitcher. Close to 25% of his pitches this season have reached 100+ miles per hour.

Click here or download it wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nReason for optimism: Skenes was the first-overall pick of last year's draft after dominating in his lone season at LSU after transferring from Air Force. The 6-foot-6, 235-pound right-hander can blow hitters away with a fastball that can get as high as 102 MPH and routinely is in the high 90s with a solid -- if unspectacular -- amount of life to the offering. On top of that heater, Skenes will throw a slider that elicits plus-plus (70 on the 20-80 scouting scale) grades with late tilt that can get swings-and-misses from hitters on either side of the plate. He also has a \"splinker\" and cutter to keep hitters honest with a traditional change that has seen vast improvement -- and considerably more usage -- since joining the pro ranks.\n\nWhile Skenes doesn't have elite command of those offerings, he typically does a good job of filling up the strike zone, and he has only allowed one homer thus far in his 27 1/3 innings with Triple-A Indianapolis. Command shouldn't be a significant issue for Skenes now or in the future.\n\nReasons for pessimism: That inning count I just mentioned. Skenes has made seven starts thus far in 2024, and he has gone more than four innings twice. It's worth noting that those outings are his last two, but the fact of the matter is that Skenes has been treated with kid gloves in his first full professional season. The Pirates appear to be loosening the chain a smidgen, but this is not a starter that fantasy managers should expect to see consistently go six-plus innings in starts. There will be outings he doesn't even get five, and the fact that'll prevent him from win chances is something that needs to be considered.\n\nAnd, of course, this is still a player with limited experience that is going to be playing the hardest sport in the world. We have seen a plethora of elite prospects struggle in their first taste of MLB action. You know how this can go. It's still worth pointing out.\n\nShould you get him? Yeah, even with the concern laid out, Skenes should be rostered. There aren't many MLB pitchers -- must less prospects -- who have the ability to miss bats that the 21-year-old does, and it should come with solid rates across the board. The fantasy potential for 2025 and beyond is even more exciting, but that doesn't mean that Skenes can't be a tremendous help to fantasy rosters in 2024, as well.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Skenes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Skenes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fantasy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slider_(pitch)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slider (pitch)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cut fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force_Academy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force Academy"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_per_hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miles per hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_glove", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball glove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b26be88/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1080+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhdliveextra-a.akamaihd.net%2FHD%2Fimage_sports%2FNBCU_Sports_Group_-_nbcsports%2F1019%2F519%2Fnbc_yahoo_skenes_v2_240408__240819.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547286", "eventUri": "eng-9547286", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

He shined in his start against the Baltimore Orioles in the Spring Breakout prospect showcase, striking out Jackson Holliday, the 2022 No. 1 overall pick and baseball's top prospect.\n\nAfter relying primarily on his four-seamer and slider while serving as the Friday night starter for LSU, the Pirates wanted Skenes to build up his pitch count and develop a routine between starts in the minors. He increased his pitch count from the mid-40s to 75 in his sixth start, when he had seven strikeouts in a season-high six innings against Buffalo.\n\nSkenes posted an 0.99 ERA and 0.91 WHIP in 27 1/3 innings over seven starts this season.

And entering Monday's games, their 22 errors were tied for third most in the National League.\n\nSurprisingly, though, one element of the team that has been better than expected has been the starting pitching. As of Monday night, the starting staff's 3.50 ERA was fourth best in the National League, its 1.15 WHIP was third best, and the batting average against of .234 was fifth.\n\nNot bad given the low expectation for what the rotation was supposed to look like until first-round pick Paul Skenes got called up from the minor leagues.\n\nWhich, as all Pirates fans are acutely aware, still has yet to happen.\n\nIt's even better considering that Mitch Keller's performance -- until Monday night's 4-1 complete-game gem to beat Los Angeles -- hadn't been up to snuff this spring.\n\nEven with Monday's excellent start, Keller's ERA is still at 4.41. Fortunately, his struggles have been offset by:\n\n* Jared Jones being among the league leaders in strikeouts\n\n* Quinn Priester throwing two good starts since his recall\n\n* Marco Gonzales tossing two of three quality starts before his injury\n\n* Martin Perez's 2.86 ERA through April\n\n* Bailey Falter posting a 2.89 during five April starts\n\nI saw almost none of that coming.\n\n* Tim Benz: Blaming assistant coaches won't fix Pittsburgh's plodding sports teams\n\n* Mark Madden: Umpires hardly at root of Pirates' offensive struggles -- and other sports notes\n\n* Madden Monday: 'Sully has got to go. I'm tired of saying, 'He's a great coach, but ...''\n\nLet's not allow any of those results to cloud or confuse what's going on with Skenes, though. He should be called up at any time now. Frankly, that probably should've happened already.\n\nWhether it's been monitoring service time, pitch counts, innings logs, or \"boxes to check\" for pitching on four days' rest, the Pirates have put their No. 1 overall pick through a very regimented and calculated plan before getting to the big leagues.\n\nHere's to hoping a little unexpected success from some of his peers doesn't complicate that even more.\n\n\"It's challenging. You're talking about a couple of different things,\" manager Derek Shelton said Monday. \"No. 1, you're talking about a difference in the ball. No. 2, you're talking about a whole different routine in terms of scheduling. Because you do it once a week (in college), you have a ton of time to recover. You can throw multiple bullpens if you want. You can throw one bullpen if you want. It's so much different (than MLB).\"\n\nNow, if the Pirates are looking for a crack in the rotation to slot in Skenes, that could delay things even more. But that's not something the Pirates should concern themselves with at this point. If Falter has to get moved out of the rotation, move Falter out of the rotation. If Priester has to go back down to Triple-A, send Priester back down and get Skenes up to Pittsburgh when he is forecasted to come up.\n\nSkenes' most recent outing in Indianapolis on Sunday was less than stellar -- two earned runs on three hits (including a homer) and two walks with a season-low four strikeouts in 4\u2153 innings. But his ERA in seven starts is still 0.99 and he has 45 strikeouts in 27.1 innings pitched.\n\nFor now, anyway, Shelton is still making it sound as if Skenes is going to start for Indy at least one more time.\n\n\"He's scheduled to pitch in Indy this week,\" Shelton said. \"I think with him, there was speculation he was going to pitch in this series (against the Angels), or he was going to pitch (Sunday's win over Colorado). I think when you have someone that's talented like he is, there's always going to be speculation and people are always going to have it figured out. Well, we haven't figured it out yet.\"\n\nOne suggestion that has been made is that the Pirates go to a six-man rotation. That seems counterintuitive to me since so much of the planning for Skenes in the first place has been done with an eye toward getting him ready for four days' rest at a time, not five.\n\n\"You're speculating on when he's going to be here and how we're going to do that. Until we get to that point, then we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. We have not talked about any form or fashion yet,\" Shelton said.\n\nWell, there are plenty of bridges in Pittsburgh. And last time I checked, one or two of them aren't even under construction for a change. Maybe Skenes can drive over one of them on his way to PNC Park from Indianapolis sooner, not later.\n\nBecause with all due respect to the Bailey Falters, Quinn Priesters and Martin Perezes of the world, keeping the express lane open for Skenes to get here is of greatest importance.\n\nNow, it's just a matter of how quickly the Pirates are willing to drive in it.", "source": {"uri":

Even during her championship practise, she took time and watch the action on her headset.\n\nShe might have been cheering for the Indians, given Skenes association with it, but the Bats beat them 4-3.\n\nPaul Skenes earns majors call; Olivia Dunne posts a tribute\n\nThe MLB will welcome another couple when Paul Skenes takes the major league mound on Saturday for the Pittsburgh Pirates while Olivia Dunne cheers for him from the stands.\n\nIt wasn't going to be long before Skenes showcased his talent in the majors after a stellar spring with dominating minor league outings. On Wednesday, the Pittsburgh Pirates announced the promotion of Skenes and that he will be starting on Saturday against the Chicago Cubs.\n\nThe news was well received by Dunne, who took to Instagram stories and hyped about the news. She reshared a highlight reel of Skenes pitching on her story:\n\n\"...here we go,\" she wrote in her story.\n\nSkenes has 45 strikeouts in 27.1 innings this season while pitching for Triple-A Indianapolis, with an ERA of 0.99 and a WHIP of 0.91.\n\nAll that remains is to be seen if Paul Skenes can successfully transition his talent into the majors. Olivia Dunne will likely be present in Pittsburgh cheering for him from the stands.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "krutik_jain@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Krutik Jain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Skenes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Skenes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Dunne", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olivia Dunne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville_Slugger_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisville Slugger Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville_Bats", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Louisville Bats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/15d79-17152435669461-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547286", "eventUri": "eng-9547286", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

But as the most prolific hurler in the college ranks last season, pitching more than 122 innings en route to a national championship with Louisiana State University, there has been an obvious load-management component to holding off on his debut.\n\nWhatever the reason for its timing, Skenes' time in the minors did not just rest his arm. It has also now made it impossible for him to accrue the 172 days of big-league service time required to qualify for a full year in 2024. Had the Pirates called him up last month and he had accrued the necessary days, they would have \"lost\" a year of control on his contract -- a season that could very well be worth ten figures or more when the time comes. Now, he likely won't be eligible to hit free agency until 2030, rather than in 2029.\n\nPer the collective bargaining agreement reached in 2022, Skenes might still earn his full year of service time if he finishes in the top-two for National League Rookie of the Year Award voting. But the Pirates can be confident that won't happen in the 25 or so starts Skenes might make.\n\nCurrent odds have Skenes in sixth place in the voting (though this is before he's made a big-league start), behind a pair of pitchers who made their professional debuts in Japan, Shota Imanaga and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, as well as his own teammate, Jared Jones, who has a 2.63 ERA and 52 strikeouts across seven starts already.\n\nSpeaking with ESPN's Jeff Passan, Pirates general manager Ben Cherington dismissed speculation that the team was intentionally holding Skenes back in an effort to retain a season of club control.\n\n\"I really don't believe it's played any role in this case. I really mean this,\" Cherington said. \"We decided in spring training that ... we wanted to build the volume more slowly than an established major league starter would. Once we made that decision, functionally, it has to start in the minor leagues.\"\n\nLike many of its rules and norms, MLB's standards for rookie contracts are complicated and seem increasingly anachronistic.\n\nPlayers who are drafted domestically are subject to specific contract parameters based on where they are selected. The first three years of the contract are \"pre-arbitration\" years, during which a team can pay them near the league minimum regardless of what the open market might determine as their value. In the subsequent years, the player is eligible for salary arbitration, a process by which a third-party panel steps in if the player and team cannot agree on a salary figure.\n\nAfter six or seven years, players are typically eligible to become free agents and receive contract offers as determined by the open market of MLB teams competing with one another for his services.\n\nIn comparison, NBA players reach restricted free agency following their fourth year of service. All drafted NFL players receive four-year contracts. The sports are very different, and MLB players can negotiate their signing bonuses and don't have to sign with the teams that select them. But it can seem as if the best MLB draftees are not rewarded as well as their equivalents in other major sports or even their international counterparts who come to MLB.\n\nUpon being drafted, the Pirates gave Skenes the largest-ever bonus at $9.2 million as determined by his \"slot value.\" Victor Wembanyama, the first overall pick in the 2023 NBA draft, received a four-year, $55 million contract with $24.9 million guaranteed. Wembanyama can test free agency in 2028, while Skenes will almost certainly have to wait until 2030.\n\nEven a single year of free agency could be highly valuable to Skenes, particularly as he's a high-velocity fastball thrower whose continued health will be central to his future earnings. At least one scout has said Skenes is the best college pitcher since Stephen Strasburg. After a series of deals with the Washington Nationals, Strasburg eventually earned a seven-year, $245 million extension from the team as he opted out for free agency with 10 years of service time.\n\nOr take Yamamoto for instance. As an international free agent at 25 years old, he earned a 12-year, $325 million deal from the Los Angeles Dodgers just a few months after Skenes was drafted -- the highest-ever total for a pitcher. After a three-season college career at Air Force and Louisiana State, Skenes may not be able to test free agency until he is 27 years old.\n\nWriting for Baseball America, editor J.J. Cooper outlined the case that Skenes might have received a $50 million to $100 million signing bonus had he been a free agent instead of a draftee.\n\nUltimately, it's impossible to gauge what the market will look like for Skenes in 2030 and how much he might have lost without the chance to test the market in 2029. But his current trajectory suggests he would have been in line for a significant payday as a free agent coming into this season and could very well earn more than $10 million per season if and when he finally hits free agency.\n\nAccording to Passan, Skenes agreed with the Pirates' plan to start him in the minor leagues and, even from a purely financial perspective, the best outcome is for him to hold off on the big leagues until he is truly prepared for a long and productive career. But it's hard to understand why he's ready now, as opposed to just 29 days ago, when he would have had a chance to meet the service-time requirement. Depending on how things go, each of those days in the minors might cost him -- or save a future team that signs him -- millions.\n\nIf nothing else, the early career of last year's number-one draft pick suggests the MLB should take a new look at the \"control\" that teams can exact on their best players, the dichotomy between international free agents and college draft picks or the uneven fiscal factors at play that could shape the careers of its brightest young superstars.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Pirates have been on a slide in recent weeks, and while they rebounded for three straight wins, they succumbed to two consecutive losses to the LA Angels (9-0, 5-4).\n\nSkenes is one of the most exciting prospects in the MLB, and his girlfriend, LSU gymnast and internet sensation Olivia Dunne, only adds to the hype of his call-up. With Paul Skenes' MLB debut set for Saturday against the Chicago Cubs, anticipation is building and a post on X suggested ticket prices have soared to $5,632.\n\nFans were quick to react to the report, with some noting this must be where Olivia Dunne is sitting:\n\nThat disbelief appears to have been well founded, as others were quick to point out that the rise has not been as astronomical as the post suggested:\n\n\"Bros posting the price of the home plate club like it's a normal ticket \ud83d\udc80,\" this fan said.\n\n\"Just looked and club seats are still available. They jacked them up about 25$,\" this fan commented.\n\nTicket prices aside, this is a very exciting moment for Paul Skenes and Pittsburgh fans, as the Pirates are hoping he can help bring about a change in their fortunes. The Pirates are hoping to make the postseason in 2024 and see how far they can go, which would be huge for a fanbase lacking a playoff win since 2013 (versus the St. Louis Cardinals).\n\nPaul Skenes' call-up coincides with Pirates need for consistency\n\nFollowing consecutive losses to the LA Angels, the Pirates are 17-21 and third in the NL Central. While this was not unexpected preseason, after a hot start fans were hoping they might challenge for the division. The Pirates have yet to win the NL Central since its inception in 1994, and given they are four games behind the Milwaukee Brewers, they do have a shot in 2024.\n\nThe 22-16 Chicago Cubs are in second place, and the upcoming series is growing in importance for Pittsburgh. That series starts on Friday, and the team will be spending a rare rest day preparing for the game.\n\nWhile Paul Skenes' debut is highly anticipated, it seems unfair to burden him with too much expectation. Skenes clearly has tremendous talent and a dominating fastball, but whether he is MLB-ready remains to be seen. Pirates fans will be hoping to avoid a similar situation to Jackson Holliday and the Baltimore Orioles.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_maxwell@sportskeeda.com", "name": "John Maxwell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Skenes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Skenes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Dunne", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olivia Dunne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Tickets_For_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Tickets For Shows", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Arena_and_Indoor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Arena and Indoor", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/dcff3-17152672625649-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547286", "eventUri": "eng-9547286", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

It seems like his fastball is meant to be thrown another 10 feet further. It just gets there a lot quicker than others, like he's supposed to be throwing from 70 feet.\"\n\nIt's that unmatched velocity that's helped put Skenes in the spotlight and also created concern that he'll become yet another young pitcher that gets hurt.\n\n\"I'm just rooting for him to make it,'' Cole said. \"Some can just pick up a ball and throw it like that. I'd say it's safe to say he has one of those kinds of arms and now we're in an environment that allows you to max out sooner.\"\n\nCole stayed remarkably injury-free until this spring, when he was sidelined by elbow inflammation. He avoided surgery and could be back by midseason.\n\nAnd he threw plenty of pitches as a young pitcher in the minors -- something Skenes hasn't been permitted to do with the Pirates.\n\nSkenes has made seven starts at Triple-A this season and not thrown more than 75 pitches. Cole was throwing more than 100 pitches at Double-A by the latter part of his first pro season and is not a fan of the change in development.\n\n\"We don't know how good this guy is,'' Cole said. \"Nobody does. He could break the whole mold. He could be the greatest of all time. Why hold him back? Let him throw more, let him throw 98 [mph] instead of 102. If you limit him to 60 [pitches], he's gonna go 103 [mph]. Let the horse run. Stretch him out. You've got a window now where you can develop him.''\n\nThe 6-foot-6, 235-pound Skenes starred at LSU after spending his first two collegiate seasons at the Air Force Academy.\n\nHe'll turn 22 later this month and has thrown just 27 1/3 innings this season. Skenes has struck out 45 batters, walked just eight and has an ERA of 0.99.\n\n\"I know he's been blowing everyone's minds,'' Cole said. \"He looks like he's one of those generational-type arms. I'm excited to see what he does. He's got a lot of work ahead of him, but right out of the gate, he has the tools.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_Cole", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gerrit Cole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Shelton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derek Shelton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-seam_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Four-seam fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force_Academy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force Academy"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/newspress-collage-qzdojncvd-1715196102286.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1715181749&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547286", "eventUri": "eng-9547286", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Skenes will make his debut on May 11.\n\nSkenes, who was the No. 1 overall MLB Draft pick in 2023, has thoroughly impressed in the minor leagues. He threw for three different teams in 2023 and put together a 5.40 ERA after making five starts. However, he would significantly improve in 2024 as he got more comfortable.\n\nThe talented flamethrower has started seven games this year and sports a 0.99 ERA. He has gone 27.1 innings and allowed just three earned runs on 17 hits, striking out 45 while walking only eight.\n\nThat got him the call-up from the Pirates.\n\nThere is a whole lot of potential for the former LSU standout, who spent just one year with the Tigers after transferring in from Air Force. But what a year it was.\n\nLSU captured a national championship with Paul Skenes as the ace on the staff, and he was every bit the part of an arm that could carry you to a championship.\n\nSkenes was named the 2023 Dick Howser Trophy winner, the National Player of the Year by D1 Baseball and Collegiate Baseball, a consensus first-team All-American and the College World Series Most Outstanding Player.\n\nThat came after he was a first-team All-American in both of his two years at Air Force.\n\nIn his college career, Paul Skenes went 24-6 as a starter and had a 2.18 ERA. He even saved 11 games, doing so as a freshman at Air Force.

It's the most anticipated pitching prospect debut in recent memory.\n\nThe biggest reason is that Paul Skenes is a phenom, as he dominated the SEC last year at LSU and has picked up where he left off in professional baseball. But, his very famous girlfriend, Olivia Dunne, is also part of the reason.\n\nDunne, who recently wrapped up her career as a gymnast at LSU as the team captured the 2024 National Championship, is a much bigger deal in general American culture than Paul Skenes. Frankly, it isn't even close.\n\nDunne boasts over 13 million followers on Instagram and TikTok combined. And, she's pretty much everywhere when it comes to the marketing world. She boasts sponsors like Vuori, Grubhub, American Eagle, among others. And, she's already been featured in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit magazine. Dunne became one of the big faces of college athletes getting Name, Image, and Likeness rights (NIL), and has had billboards in Times Square, as well. Safe to say, she's a pretty big deal.\n\nWhen it was announced earlier this week that Paul Skenes would be making his Pirates debut on Saturday, I'm sure many people wondered if Olivia Dunne would be in attendance this weekend.\n\nThat question appears to have been answered in the affirmative.\n\nAs famous as Olivia. Dunne is, she's obviously not as famous as Taylor Swift. But, the NFL saw a bump of viewership when Swift started attending boyfriend Travis Kelce's games. Maybe there will be a bump in viewership of Pirates games that Skenes is pitching in when Dunne is in the stands?\n\nThat being said, most of Swift's fan base is women, and I'm not sure the same is true for Olivia Dunne's fans.

Since then he's been lighting up the minor leagues with his electric fastball. He regularly topped 100 miles per hour on the pitch, as 98 of the 422 pitches he threw this season in the minors topped the century mark, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. He averaged a cool 99.9 miles per hour on the pitch, according to the outlet.\n\nSkenes' quick call-up, while not unprecedented, is super rare. If he gets the official call-up on Friday, that would mark 306 days since the Pirates drafted him. Only 22 players in MLB history have ascended more quickly than that, according to Baseball America. (RELATED: Budding MLB Superstar Saves Game With Heroic Home Run Robbery)\n\nWhile it may be a quick call, it's certainly not undeserving. Skenes has been tearing up the minors. He'd already reached number three on the MLB's top 100 prospects list, and number one amongst pitchers. The two guys above him, Jackson Chourio and Jackson Holliday, had already received their call-ups (though Holliday has already been sent back to the minors.)\n\nHis AAA numbers are insane. In 27.1 innings pitched he'd only given up three earned runs, good for a 0.99 earned run average. He added 45 strikeouts and an insane 5.63 strikeouts-to-walks ratio.\n\nThe kid is poised to take the league by storm.

Will they capitalize?", "body": "PITTSBURGH -- Wait a second. This hasn't even happened yet, and we're already talking shelf lives?\n\nYou bet we are. That's the point. That's what Pirates owner Bob Nutting should be talking about. And acting upon. His franchise is about to embark on one of the most potentially exhilarating and unique eras in its 143-year history. He must capitalize on it.\n\nThe Pirates will soon unveil a one-two pitching punch unparalleled in their modern history, if we're talking homegrown talents. The two will be the hottest topic in baseball.\n\nAs a Pirates fan, if you're ever going to dream big, this is the time. Baseball America has Paul Skenes, 21, and Jared Jones, 22, ranked one-two among top MLB pitching prospects. Jones is already here and baffling major league hitters, doing things we have not seen before. Skenes will make his major league debut Saturday against the Chicago Cubs after annihilating Triple-A hitters with a devastating arsenal that has included dozens upon dozens of 100-mph heaters.\n\nI don't think it's unreasonable to at least wonder if these two could form a historically great duo. I'm not sure we're talking Sandy Koufax-Don Drysdale, the duo by which all others are measured, but I did say we're dreaming big, right? How about a little Tim Lincecum/Matt Cain from the Giants' renaissance, or Tim Hudson/Barry Zito of Oakland A's \"Moneyball\" times?\n\nHow about Kerry Wood and Mark Prior from the early 2000s Cubs? They were the No. 2 and 4 overall picks in different years and helped the Cubs win a division title and nearly make the World Series in 2003, before Steve Bartman interjected. The two struck out a combined 511 batters that season.\n\nBut they also provided a history lesson: Pitching is a precarious profession, and it's no more secure now than it was when Prior and Wood quickly saw their careers decline on account of injuries. It's likely worse. One cannot go a day without reading of another young power pitcher who has succumbed to injury.\n\nYou can't predict health, and you can't predict performance. And even if all goes well on those two fronts, Jones and Skenes are in Nutting Country. Therefore, their Pirates futures could be limited even if and maybe especially if they become stars. The smart bet is that they will become trade candidates before they hit free agency.\n\nThink of Gerrit Cole, who spent five years here before he was dealt. It's possible the Pirates could try to lock up Jones and/or Skenes with one of these early-career, long-term deals we've seen across baseball, but those don't usually apply to pitchers because of the obvious risk involved.\n\nListen, if the Pirates get five good years of Skenes and Jones, I'd be happy -- and that short window is about to open. We should enjoy every second of it. This is not meant to be a bummer of a column. It's meant to convey the urgency here.\n\nWhich brings us back to our original point: Nutting needs to capitalize, and quite frankly, he has already failed on that front. Jones and Skenes are coming to a club with a popgun lineup, handcuffed by an offseason shopping trip that was limited to flea markets and the Dollar Store.\n\nSomebody needs to tap Nutting on the shoulder and let him know: The time is NOW, Bob. This is it. This is your golden opportunity. Your golden geese are here, or about to arrive, and there is no telling when the window shuts.\n\nIt's pro sports. It's pitchers. It's Pittsburgh. Those three factors don't exactly scream longevity. So spend more. Make that investment. Order your GM to find offense by any means necessary because the dire lack of it, from the major leagues on down, could undermine everything.\n\nShamefully, it has been nearly a decade since a baseball game of real significance has taken place at PNC Park. It took more than a decade for that to happen once the place opened, as well. We're constantly waiting for \"now,\" and I'm here to tell you that \"now\" has arrived.\n\nMaximize it.\n\n(c)2024 the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\nVisit the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette at www.post-gazette.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_starkey@eagletribune.com", "name": "Joe Starkey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_Wood", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kerry Wood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Prior", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Prior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moneyball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Zito", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barry Zito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bartman_incident", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Bartman incident"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Cain", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Cain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Lincecum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Lincecum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Power pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PNC Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_Cole", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gerrit Cole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Post-Gazette", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/custom/image/ae213140-df8c-11e7-b06d-b798580d75a5.jpg?resize=600%2C333", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547286", "eventUri": "eng-9547286", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

It's just doing little stuff every day. He doesn't need to come out here and throw a no-hitter his first game.\"\n\nOr, you know, hit what would prove to be a game-winning home run during his Major League debut?\n\n\"Or that. That was pretty cool too,\" Tucker laughed, realizing the irony of his oversight.\n\nIndeed, Tucker made as big of a Day 1 \"splash\" as any Pirate first-rounder when he homered in his first game to help beat the San Francisco Giants 3-1 on April 20, 2019. However, his greater point about how Skenes should approach his first few months in the Majors is nonetheless prescient.\n\n\"Know who you are. Know what makes you tick. Know what's going to help you succeed and go out and try to do that,\" Tucker said. \"This game is all about performance. It's all about results. It's all about winning. And the more you do little things to help the team do that every day, the longer you're going to stick around.\"\n\nTucker also cautioned Skenes to be aware that failures will occur. How the big right-hander handles those days will go a long way toward how he navigates his early years in MLB.\n\n\"It's just not freaking out. Not getting up there and panicking. Remaining calm, remaining confident,\" Tucker said. \"Those were the biggest things that I wish I could go back and tell my 22-year-old self to do and be. But you just don't know. You don't have the knowledge, or the wisdom, or the experience yet to do that. And as you grow and get older, you learn it more.\"\n\nBy his own admission, Tucker is still mastering those things. After being designated for assignment by the Pirates in May 2022, the 27-year-old has had stops with the Diamondbacks, Rockies, Mariners and Angels organizations.\n\n\"Some guys come up and have an instant impact, so just stick and stay. Look at (Bryan) Reynolds,\" Tucker said of the Pirates outfielder. \"Reynolds and I came up on the same day. He was ready for the opportunity. I wasn't, and that's why our careers have kind of shaped out how they have. But if Paul comes up here and just takes care of the little things and remains the same, remains calm, remains confident, he's going to have a ton of success.\"\n\n* After lottery, Penguins' 1st-round draft pick officially goes to Sharks\n\n* Titans bolster wide receiving group by adding Tyler Boyd\n\n* Tim Benz: If the Pirates 'haven't figured out yet' how to promote Paul Skenes, don't make it harder than it needs to be\n\nTucker also understands that Skenes isn't just any first-rounder making the jump to the big leagues. He is doing it as last year's first-overall pick. And he is doing it with an organization whose entire business model is platformed on the premise of selling hope surrounding high-profile prospects.\n\n\"There's a lot of pressure with that,\" Tucker admitted. \"Pittsburgh is such a great sports city. Everyone cares. Everyone gives a (crap). It means a lot to a lot of people. It's easy to come up here and get kind of lost in that. (Skenes) is going to get called up and be like, 'All right. Hell, yeah. I did it. I'm the prince of the city. I'm the mayor of this town, and everyone's counting on me.' I feel like that's an unhealthy way to take it on. If he keeps the big leagues in the same regard as he does in Triple-A or anywhere else he's played, he's going to be a lot better.\"\n\nTucker is also uniquely qualified to appreciate where Skenes' life is off the field -- in terms of being with a partner who might be even more famous than he is.\n\nSkenes is dating LSU gymnast Livvy Dunne, one of the most recognizable figures in the social media sphere. She has 5.1 million Instagram followers. Her first-round draft choice boyfriend has 254,000.\n\nTucker is married to actress Vanessa Hudgens of \"High School Musical\" fame. Her Instagram follower count is 51.3 million.\n\n\"Just keep your private life, your private life,\" Tucker suggested. \"Don't let everybody in and see every little detail. Because when it's good, it's great. But when it's bad, everyone's going to be micro-dissecting everything you do.\"\n\nTucker says that Dunne's athletic background should allow the couple to navigate the waters better than other young couples who are being thrust into the spotlight under similar circumstances.\n\n\"She's a gymnast.

Skenes has already been added to ESPN rosters in 26.6% of leagues in just the past 24 hours, and if you're in one of the roughly 40% of leagues in which he remains available, head to your free-agent list right now to pick him up. (Don't forget to then return here to read more about him as well as what else is ahead this weekend!)\n\nWhile the only higher-ranked prospect recalled since Opening Day, Jackson Holliday of the Baltimore Orioles, flopped in his first taste of big league action, there are only so many opportunities to roster a player with Skenes' potential. Some prospects will disappoint during their first try, as Holliday, Spencer Torkelson and (*gasp*) Mike Trout did, but others, like Adley Rutschman, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bryce Harper, will instantly thrive.\n\nSkenes has the skill set to do the latter, equipped with a four-seam fastball that has averaged 99.9 mph in his seven starts for Triple-A Indianapolis, a slider that has generated a 43% whiff rate on hitters' swings, a splitter that has a 38% whiff rate and a changeup that is a perfect 8-of-8 in getting whiffs. There's a reason he's often compared to Strasburg and, to a lesser degree, Cole, as they were pitchers who delivered 1.5 and 1.4 WAR values and sub-3.25 ERAs in their debut seasons.\n\nIf there's a concern to amplify with Skenes, it's the Pirates' careful management of his workload as a professional. Through 12 professional starts, another during spring training and a relief outing during said Grapefruit League action, he has never thrown more than 75 pitches in a single game, averaging 45 over the 12 games (spring training included) that were tracked. That said, he threw 65, 71, 75 and 66 in his last four for Indianapolis, as the Pirates advanced his ramping-up program.\n\nPacing Skenes' 2024 minor league innings, he's on track for roughly 120, which is a realistic year-end target -- subtract his 27\u2153 in the minors and we're talking approximately 95 in the majors -- and the Pirates' decision to introduce him as a member of a six-man rotation follows that design. A fair guess would be 100 MLB innings over 20 starts and an average of 80 pitches per start.\n\nThat's not a far cry from the 2023 workload of then-Los Angeles Dodgers rookie Bobby Miller and remember that Miller was in a more pressing situation as far as the team expecting a big contribution at the time. Skenes' impact might be along similar lines, and Miller finished 2023 as the SP57 (and 198th overall) in fantasy points scored, despite not debuting until May 23.\n\nThe Texas Rangers reap both the hitting benefits and pitching pitfalls of a weekend trip to Colorado's Coors Field, in which active staff ace Jon Gray is scheduled to make his first start there -- likely on Friday, after Dane Dunning landed on the IL -- since he left the Colorado Rockies as a free agent following the 2021 season.\n\nThe Rangers boast four hitters who were selected among the top-100 overall picks in ESPN leagues, Marcus Semien, Corey Seager, Adolis Garcia and Evan Carter. Another, Jonah Heim, ranks among the top 10 in fantasy points among catchers for the season. Nathaniel Lowe, meanwhile, is the team's leader in scoring since his April 20 activation. All six are well worth having in your lineup for all three games -- always check the daily lineups in standard leagues, of course -- as all shape up as regulars for the team.\n\nCan Gray succeed again at Coors, where he averaged 9.9 fantasy points-per-start during his Rockies career? This season, in which the Rockies' 3.88 runs-per-game average at Coors ranks just 22nd in home games, not to mention well beneath the league's overall 4.36 average, presents the rare \"consider 'em\" decision for pitchers visiting Coors. In 15 games there thus far, opposing starters have averaged 12.9 fantasy points-per-start, with seven of those outings worth 15-plus.\n\nGray, as well as closer Kirby Yates, are worth your while in most situations -- always evaluate the starter's point projection when deciding -- though plenty of offense should be expected from lineups against the other five scheduled starters between both teams.\n\nIt's quite the weekend for starting pitchers returning from injuries, though at publication time, few of their teams had made official announcements.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com",

Being good at what you do doesn't make you a legend, that makes you good at your job. To be a legend, you have to go well above good and be something more. And Paul Skenes definitely earned the title of legend during his time at Louisiana State University.\n\nHe broken Ben McDonald's long standing SEC & LSU single season strike out record. He won National Pitcher of the Year. He won the Dick Howser Trophy. He was named the College World Series Most Outstanding Player. He became the second LSU player to be selected first in the MLB draft (the first since Ben McDonald was selected 1/1 by the Orioles in 1989). Oh, and he's the top rated pitching prospect since Stephen Strasburg. So, the guy is the definition of a college legend.\n\nWith that said, just because you're a legend at the College level, that doesn't mean you're going to be a great or legendary player in the majors. As much as I personally love Ben McDonald, he never quite lived up to the hype. Todd Walker had a good MLB career, but wasn't exactly legendary. You just never know how guys will turn out when they get on the big stage. But, some guys end up living up to the hype or over delivering. Immediately, former LSU Tiger Aaron Nola comes to mind. He's been an All-Star and tied Tom Seaver's record for most consecutive strikeouts in a game.\n\nWhat will Paul Skenes do at the pro level? Only time will tell, but we're going to get our first look at him in a Pirates Uniform this weekend.\n\nSkenes has absolutely DOMINATED at the minor league level. The 6-6, 235 pound pitcher never picked up a win in the minors (mostly because the Pirates didn't let him pitch beyond the 4th inning), but in 34 innings he racked up 55 strikeouts and an ERA of 1.85. Which is pretty damn impressive, at any professional level.\n\nAnd now, he's going to be joining the Pirates big league club and is scheduled to start Saturday at home in Pittsburgh against the Chicago Cubs.\n\nThe kid has GREAT stuff. 100+ mph 4-seam fastball. 95+ mph sinker. And rounds out his bag with a quality slider, change-up and curveball. If he can locate, he's going to keep hitters from making quality contact against him. He definitely has all the tools to be a big league success.\n\nThe biggest question, and probably why the Pirates have handled him with kids gloves thus far, is can he stay healthy? As I mentioned earlier in the post, many experts compare him to Stephen Strausburg & Mark Prior. Which, stuff wise, is pretty elite company. The problem is both of those guys had potential hall of fame careers cut-short by injuries. Basically, both guys ripped their arms apart because their stuff was so good.\n\nFor every Nolan Ryan, there's dozens of pitching prospects that fall short of expectations due to injury. At this point, after scouring the internet for Skenes injury history, nothing popped up. However, between college & the minors, he's only thrown 277 innings. That's over 4 seasons. At the big league level, he's probably going to need to throw a minimum of 170 innings every year. Will his body be able to handle the work load? We're going to find out pretty darn quick.", "source": {"uri": "965kvki.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "96.5 KVKI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_McDonald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben McDonald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Howser_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dick Howser Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Strasburg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Strasburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Todd Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Seaver", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Seaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Prior", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Prior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Ryan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nolan Ryan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_glove", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball glove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curveball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curveball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Changeup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/180/files/2024/05/attachment-Skenes.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547286", "eventUri": "eng-9547286", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

The matchup has the potential to be disastrous for a Chicago lineup that's been erratic, to say the least, and is working to get back to full strength.\n\nIn Wednesday afternoon's 3-0 loss to the San Diego Padres, Craig Counsell's club mustered all of one hit - a Yan Gomes single - as Cease, a former Cubs prospect, dominated his former organization, cruising through seven scoreless frames and striking out 12. Given Skenes' swing-and-miss stuff, it's hard to feel too encouraged by Saturday's matchup.\n\nWith Triple-A Indianapolis this season, the overpowering right-hander has piled up strikeouts, with 45 Ks in just 27 1/3 frames, en route to a 0.99 ERA. On the heels of a national championship with LSU in 2023, Skenes hasn't missed a beat since going pro, entering this season as the consensus top pitching prospect in the game.\n\nThe Cubs head into this weekend's matchup with the Pirates as a very middle-of-the-pack team in terms of offense, ranking 14th of 30 clubs with a .701 OPS. The biggest issue has been a lack of slug in the middle of the order, with Christopher Morel and Michael Busch providing most of the pop to this point, both of whom have already gone through cold spells at various points.\n\nCody Bellinger returned to the Cubs lineup on Tuesday night, immediately making his presence felt with a home run as part of a three-hit night, but the reigning NL Comeback Player of the Year is still not 100% healed from the rib injury that sent him to the IL. Fellow outfielder Seiya Suzuki could return this weekend and, hopefully, he can pick up right where he left off before hitting the shelf.\n\nIt's been all eyes on the Chicago bullpen, which has drawn much criticism in the season's first month. But the offense has been just as big of an issue but has somehow flown under the radar thanks to the otherworldly performance of the starting rotation over the last three-plus weeks. Skenes has all the tools to pitch at the highest level, and we'll quickly see if the Cubs can start to get back on track at the plate or if they prove to be the punch line on Saturday in the Steel City.", "source": {"uri": "cubbiescrib.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cubbies Crib"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PNC Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Strasburg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Strasburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yan_Gomes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yan Gomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Counsell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Craig Counsell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiya_Suzuki", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seiya Suzuki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Comeback_Player_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Comeback Player of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Bellinger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cody Bellinger"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3000,h_1687,x_0,y_76/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/9/01hxf1ex6pyny2bxmt88.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547286", "eventUri": "eng-9547286", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

A special advisor on pitching development, Robinson has more than 40 years of coaching experience under his belt and is one of the highest ranking members of the Pirates' pitching team.\n\nLike so many scouts, Robinson wanted to get eyes on the top pitching prospect in the country. The difference was the Pirates held the first overall pick in that summer's MLB Draft. If they wanted the 6-foot-6 mustachioed, high-socks-wearing fireballer who seemingly blew up social media every time he took the mound, they could have him.\n\nRobinson's report from that day was brief, coming in at about two pages. It touched on his impressions of him as a pitcher, his makeup as a person, how advanced he was in his development and the two pitches that had made him a sensation: His triple-digit fastball and wipeout slider. But it was his closer at the bottom of the second page that really cemented Robinson's feelings on the prodigy who went by the name of Paul Skenes:\n\nWe've got to take this guy.\n\n\"He's one in a decade,\" Robinson later told MLB.com. \"You don't get an opportunity to get a guy walking into your camp like this. Some guys you can develop over years and get to that point, but he's walking in as that guy.\"\n\nThe Pirates would go on to take Skenes, the most hyped pitching prospect of his generation, as the first overall pick that July and signed him to the largest signing bonus in MLB history. He jumped to the top of MLB Pipeline's prospect chart, ranking as the top pitcher in the sport before he threw a professional pitch. Comparisons immediately were made to some of the greatest young pitchers of their time, namely Stephen Strasburg.\n\nAnd now Skenes is ready to make his Major League debut, scheduled to face the Cubs at PNC Park on Saturday at 4:05 p.m. ET.", "source": {"uri": "mlb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MLB.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_Rouge,_Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slider_(pitch)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slider (pitch)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Power pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PNC Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing_bonus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Signing bonus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Strasburg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Strasburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MLB.com"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://img.mlbstatic.com/mlb-images/image/upload/t_2x1/t_w1536/mlb/mwjgu9zvwonjmuxpvcjc.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547286", "eventUri": "eng-9547286", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

It took them forever to promote Paul Skenes. The Penguins fired an assistant coach. And the Steelers essentially admitted they shouldn't have drafted a running back in the first round four years ago.\n\nThere is plenty of room for grumbling in Pittsburgh sports these days, and you have found your ways to grumble to me.\n\nBruce wants me to \"call out\" the Pirates for their \"abyssal\" hitting. I think he means \"abysmal\" hitting. But the Pirates have pretty much been in an abyss since 2015 anyway. So let's not split hairs.\n\n\"Please call out the Pirates for their abyssal hitting! The Angels have allowed the second most runs in the league -- and they shut you out at home??\n\nThis a total embarrassment to cap off a month of crappy hitting. Heads must roll.\"\n\nYou're right. I should do that. I should write a column criticizing the Pirates offense. How come I haven't done that yet? How could I have gone this deep into the season watching this wretched offense and never once written an artic... wait a minute.\n\nYes, Bruce. As it gets to the point when something goes so wrong with one of the teams in town that you feel the need to pound out an email saying \"You need to write about XZY,\" odds are ... I probably already have.\n\nNow, in terms of those rolling heads, I addressed that, too. But I can just post a column. I'm pretty sure the guillotine has been outlawed.\n\nAlthough with no playoff series wins since 1979, I can see why you might be rooting for it to make a comeback.\n\n\"I just love the scientific method you guys use to explain the problem the Pirates are having. It's like posting a video and explaining why dumping gasoline on a fire is a bad idea. Then using scientific evidence to explain why adding gas to a fire causes the fire to get worse. Can we just agree having (garbage) players on a team with (garbage) coaches and a (garbage) owner is why they (are garbage). It isn't Moneyball. It is incompetence and cheapness. It doesn't need in-depth analysis. THEY (are garbage).\"\n\n***Note: Dave was actually using a different word than \"garbage\" ... in case you couldn't tell.\n\nWell, Dave, I'm not sure how scientific my column really was. It was pretty much just stats indicating that the Pirates hitters have been ... well ... (garbage).\n\nWhen Najee Harris didn't get his fifth-year option picked up, I wrote that the Steelers were really indicting the draft choice of Harris four years ago, more so than the player he has become.\n\nFrank doesn't see it that way.\n\n\"Got to disagree with you, Najee is a TOTAL bust for a 1st rounder. If we chose him on the 3rd or 4th ... OK. Picking up his 5th year option would have been a mistake. He and the position that he plays simply aren't worth it.\n\nSlow, no burst, and no vision. At least Omar (Khan) and Andy (Weidl) didn't overpay him for another average year at best.\"\n\nHonestly, Frank, I don't think we disagree all that much. In terms of salary-cap-management strategy, in fact, I think a lot of the things we are saying are the same.\n\nAlso like you, I don't think Harris has been great. I think he is a bit better than you are inferring. But there are certainly better backs in the NFL.\n\nThe only thing I'd take umbrage with is when you say \"overpay.\" Harris would've counted $6.7 million on the cap next year. That will be less than 2.5% of the team's payroll. He got handed and/or thrown the ball on more than 28% of their plays last year.\n\nI wasn't making a talent comp between Skenes and Tucker. It was the matter of life experience, which, given Tucker's marriage to Vanessa Hudgens and Skenes' relationship with Livvy Dunne, is a pretty unique connection.\n\nTo say nothing of both being No. 1 picks in Pittsburgh.\n\nAfter Penguins power play coach Todd Reirden got fired, I wrote a column ripping Pittsburgh's three local sports teams for constantly trying to fix their problems by simply cycling through assistant coaches.\n\nHmmm. How can a person tell me that they just read the headline, without telling me that they just read the headline?\n\nRJ, the whole premise of the piece was that the assistant coaches are absorbing blame the head coaches and upper management should be taking.\n\nIf you don't want to read the story, that's fine. But don't comment on what you haven't read. Because you'll usually miss the point.\n\nFinally, Kevin sent me a message regarding my column about the Pirates' plan to call up Skenes. I feel like the move is a little overdue. I suggested the Pirates should \"keep the express lane open\" to get him up to Pittsburgh as soon as possible.\n\n\"Tim, if the Buccos really are in the Paul Skenes express lane, they're the (idiots) doing 50 mph and backing up traffic for miles behind them.\"\n\nMaybe, Kevin, but at least now it's happening Saturday.\n\nWe take you now to live footage of I-70 between Indianapolis and Pittsburgh ...", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_benz@triblive.com", "name": "Tim Benz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Skenes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Skenes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najee_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Najee Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Penguins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moneyball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scientific method"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_70", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interstate 70"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Reirden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Todd Reirden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_Hudgens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vanessa Hudgens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2024/05/7326163_web1_ptr-SkenesHarris-051024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547286", "eventUri": "eng-9547286", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

But his offense tailed off from there and he finished 2023 with a .213 batting average, although he did memorably become the first player to hit multiple home runs in the same game off then-Los Angeles Angels pitcher Shohei Ohtani, doing so on July 21.\n\nDavis earned the Pirates' starting catcher gig coming out of spring training a few months ago but was recently optioned to Triple-A Indianapolis to work on his offense, having hit just .162 in 23 games at the time of his demotion.\n\nHe is currently playing with the Indians.\n\n\"The one thing that stands out about Hank is he works his tail off,\" Pirates closer David Bednar said. \"That's very impressive for someone drafted so high. He has a grinder mentality to it, so I think he's got a great career ahead of him.\n\n\"He's all about his business. When you see a common theme about guys who stick around a long time, they take the game seriously, want to get better every day and Hank checks all those boxes.\"\n\nGerrit Cole: June 11, 2013\n\nIn his MLB debut, Cole faced two-time Cy Young winner Tim Lincecum and the San Francisco Giants at PNC Park.\n\nCole's debut was highly anticipated by fans, but dissimilar to the buzz around Skenes, largely to the vast difference in social media prevalence in 2013 vs. 2024.\n\n\"It was a little bit different,\" said Pirates broadcaster Neil Walker, who played with Cole from 2013-15. \"In 2013, there wasn't as much of a social media presence, so there wasn't quite as much hype. There was, but there wasn't any type of artificial buildup. Social media existed but you basically knew what MLB Network was telling you and what Baseball America was telling you, for the most part.\"\n\nCole went on to give up two runs in 6 \u2154 innings, allowing seven hits with a pair of strikeouts and no walks.\n\nCole's first MLB start began with a bang, as he struck out Gregor Blanco in three pitches, all fastballs that clocked 96 mph.\n\nLooking back, Andrew McCutchen, whom the Pirates traded two days after they dealt Cole in a January 2018 fire sale, found significance in Cole's debut for a number of reasons.\n\n\"You go through the list of first-round pitchers that the Pirates drafted and they really just didn't pan out -- it happened a lot,\" McCutchen said. \"The promise was there like all the other ones, but (Cole) lived up to the hype of what he was projected to do.\"\n\nMcCutchen started that evening and collected two hits in the 8-2 win.\n\n\"It was unique to be out in center field watching him going out, throwing 98-100 (mph) and consistently sitting there throughout the whole game,\" McCutchen said. \"He might have even got a hit in his debut, if I could remember.\"\n\nMcCutchen's memory is correct.\n\nIn addition to picking up the win, Cole knocked in a pair of runs with a bases-loaded, RBI single in the second inning.\n\nFollowing his debut: Cole became a key member of the Pirates 2013 club that ended 20 straight years of losing in Pittsburgh and developed into a staff ace as the team ascended to the playoffs for three straight seasons between 2013-15.\n\nCole found even more success away from Pittsburgh, earning five All-Star selections (2019, 2019, 2021-23) with the Houston Astros and New York Yankees. As a member of the Yankees in 2023, he captured the AL Cy Young.\n\nKris Benson: April 9, 1999\n\nBenson was a collegiate standout at Clemson, earning ACC Athlete of the Year honors for all sports in 1996.\n\nBy the time Benson made his MLB debut early in the 1999 campaign, the Pirates had fallen on hard times, riding six straight losing seasons.\n\nBut a new ballpark (the construction of PNC Park began only two days before Benson's first outing) offered the promise of a new chapter for the Pirates, of which Benson was at the forefront.\n\n\"We weren't really good in the late 90s and he was thought of as being the anchor to the staff when we moved over to PNC Park in 2001,\" said Pirates team historian Jim Trdinich. \"...There was a lot of hype for Kris Benson.\"\n\nBenson and the Pirates faced the Chicago Cubs at Three Rivers Stadium for his MLB debut.\n\nDespite only recording two hits, the Pirates won 2-1.\n\nBenson lasted six innings, allowing two hits and a run with three walks and three strikeouts, picking up the victory.\n\nFollowing his debut: Benson went 11-14 with a 4.07 ERA in 1999 as a rookie and was sharp in 2000, posting a career-low 3.85 ERA and collecting 10 wins.\n\nAfter missing all of 2001 due to Tommy John surgery, he returned to being a key member of the Pirates' rotation for a few more years, albeit with a lesser degree of success, before the club traded him to the New York Mets in the middle of 2004.\n\nBenson played until 2010 with the Mets, Baltimore Orioles, Texas Rangers and Arizona Diamondbacks. He finished his MLB career with a 70-75 record and 4.42 ERA in 206 games.\n\nBryan Bullington: Sept. 18, 2005\n\nBullington's lackluster MLB debut promptly stoked fears that the Pirates may have swung and missed when they selected him atop the 2002 MLB Draft.\n\nA late-season callup in 2005, with the Pirates going on to finish 67-95 on the year, Bullington debuted Sept. 18, coming out of the bullpen in relief of Oliver Perez against the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nBullington pitched 1\u2153 innings, allowing two earned runs with a walk and strikeout.\n\nHis first outing of the year would also prove to be his last, as Bullington didn't pitch again in 2005.\n\nAbout a month later, he underwent shoulder surgery that sidelined him for the entire 2006 campaign.\n\nFollowing his debut: Bullington recovered from surgery in 2006 and briefly appeared with the Pirates late in the 2007 season before ultimately being designated for assignment in 2008.\n\nFrom 2008-10, he appeared in 20 big-league games, bouncing around to the Cleveland Indians, Toronto Blue Jays and Kansas City Royals. He enjoyed a more successful career from 2011-15 in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball, where he was an All-Star in 2011.\n\n\"Bryan was a great player, great athlete, but some guys just don't hit and he unfortunately didn't hit for us in the big leagues,\" Trdinich said.\n\nOriginally chosen by the Cubs out of high school late in the 1983 MLB draft, King elected to attend the University of Arkansas and after graduating. He was picked atop the 1986 draft by the Pirates, who finished 57-104 the year prior in Chuck Tanner's final season as skipper.\n\nAfter parts of four seasons navigating their farm system, the Pirates called up King in the summer of 1989, with the club facing the New York Mets, who started four-time All-Star and Cy Young winner Dwight Gooden on June 2.\n\nGooden dueled the Pirates' John Smiley that night, with the game tied 1-1 after nine innings.\n\nAfter a scoreless 10th, King made his debut, pinch-hitting for Benny Distefano to lead off the top of the 11th.\n\nFacing New York reliever Rick Aguilera, King quickly got in an 0-2 hole but on the third pitch from Aguilera, hit a double just over third baseman Howard Johnson's head.\n\nKing came home to score on a Glenn Wilson single, but the Pirates ultimately lost 3-2 when Randy Kramer gave up a game-winning, two-run homer in the bottom of the 11th to Dave Magadan.\n\nFollowing his debut: King became an important piece for the Pirates, who were on the rise in the NL East and won three straight division titles between 1990-92, falling in the NLCS in each year.\n\nKing saw several seasons with the Pirates derailed due to

Strasburg, the 2019 World Series MVP whose career was derailed by injuries, officially was listed by Major League Baseball on Saturday, April 6, 2024, as being retired.\n\nWhen searching for comparisons to Paul Skenes and his 10-month path from being selected with the No. 1 overall pick to making his first start in the major leagues, one name rings most prominent.\n\nWhere the Pittsburgh Pirates are pumped for the first MLB start by Skenes against the Chicago Cubs on Saturday at PNC Park, they were the on the receiving end of Stephen Strasburg's dominant debut almost 14 years ago.\n\nStrasburg was a hard-throwing right-handed pitcher whose triple-digit fastball at San Diego State captured baseball's attention and made him the obvious No. 1 pick in 2009, long before Skenes did the same in leading LSU to the College World Series championship and becoming the first overall pick by the Pirates last year.\n\n\"I don't think there's been an anticipation for a pitching debut like this in all of major league baseball like this since Strasburg,\" said Jonathan Mayo of MLB Pipeline. \"I can't think of one - and there's been some very good pitching prospects, but not in terms of the No. 1 pick storyline. Strasburg had more hype because he was so clearly the No. 1 pick heading into the draft. It wasn't clear that Skenes was the guy - he was the pitcher - but what he's done since and how he's dominated at the high levels is very similar, in terms of the anticipation. That's not just a Pittsburgh thing. This is the most anticipated pitching debut of any player since Stephen Strasburg.\"\n\nAs the Pirates prepare for the hype surrounding Skenes, it brought back memories for some in the organization of facing Strasburg and the Washington Nationals on June 8, 2010 in Washington, D.C. The game, billed as \"Strasmas,\" drew a sellout crowd of 40,315 to Nationals Park, which was averaging 21,560.\n\n\"It was probably the most hyped game I could ever remember for a debut,\" Pirates broadcaster John Wehner said. \"You're thinking, 'This guy's going to be better than anybody we've ever seen.'\n\n\"Obviously, he was a huge prospect and it didn't take him long to get to the big leagues. That was a big deal. Who only pitches two months in the minor leagues and gets to the big leagues? They did a national broadcast with Bob Costas doing the game (on MLB Network). That's how big of a deal it was.\"\n\nAndrew McCutchen, who was the leadoff batter for the Pirates, recalls Colorado Rockies righty Ubaldo Jimenez being the only starting pitcher in the majors whose fastball touched triple digits consistently. McCutchen knew more about Strasburg's reputation than his stuff.\n\n\"Obviously, the hype of him coming up, being a starter that throws 100 mph, at that time it was pretty much unheard of,\" said McCutchen, now a 37-year-old designated hitter for the Pirates. \"We didn't have much video, like we do now, so we didn't really get to see what he can do. ... So you're going up there like, 'I'm going to see what this looks like.'\"\n\nMcCutchen was disappointed when Strasburg's first two pitches were 97.2-mph four-seamers well outside the strike zone. When McCutchen connected on the third offering, clocked at 97.8, for a line drive to shortstop Ian Desmond, he returned to the visiting dugout with a cocksure confidence that the rookie was rattled.\n\n\"I remember coming in like, 'We're going to crush this guy,'\" McCutchen said.\n\nStrasburg got Neil Walker to ground out to second before recording his first career strikeout, getting Lastings Milledge swinging at three pitches, the last two curveballs. After Ryan Zimmerman homered to give Strasburg a 1-0 cushion, he struck out Garrett Jones and Delwyn Young in the second before giving up his first hit, a single to Andy LaRoche.\n\n\"As major league hitters, when you haven't seen a guy you have to get that calibration down,\" said Walker, the former Pirates second baseman who is now a broadcaster. \"We knew there was upper 90s velocity on the fastball, we knew there was a hammer breaking ball. For the most part, we were hoping for maybe mistakes that first time through the order because you knew that he was going to be amped up, that his fastball was going to have a lot of life and that he had a putaway breaking ball.\"\n\nStrasburg had six strikeouts through three innings, before Walker and Milledge hit back-to-back singles to start the fourth. Jones grounded into a double play that forced Milledge out at second. When Young hit a 1-0 changeup for a two-run home run, the Pirates took a 2-1 lead.\n\n\"It was everything you expected as far as a big, huge, dominating guy,\" Wehner said. \"When Delwyn Young hit the homer, it was like, 'Holy smokes!' Because (Strasburg) seemed invincible at that point, like nobody was going to hit him. As everybody knows, all of these guys will get hit eventually.\"\n\nMcCutchen said the Pirates' mentality switched after Young's homer, even though Strasburg's fastball had been clocked at 100.1 mph in the second inning and was touching 99 with regularity.\n\n\"It went from this hype of 'who is this guy' to 'we don't care who this guy is, we're going to get him' to 'yeah, we're celebrating (2-1) and this guy isn't going to do anything against us,'\" McCutchen said. \"Then he just shut us out for the rest of the game.\"\n\nStrasburg didn't allow another baserunner, retiring the final 10 batters he faced, including eight by strikeouts. Strasburg struck out the side in the sixth and seventh innings on his way to recording a Nationals-record 14 strikeouts without a walk while throwing 65 of his 94 pitches for strikes over seven innings in the Nationals' 5-2 win.\n\nOnly J.R. Richard of the Houston Astros and Karl Spooner of the Brookyln Dodgers had more strikeouts in their debuts - both had 15 - as Strasburg fanned every Pirates starter, as well as pinch hitter Ryan Church, and got all but McCutchen and LaRoche twice.\n\n\"It wasn't like anything I'd seen in the early part of my career,\" McCutchen said. \"All you had to do was sit there and tip your cap, like, 'This guy is really good and he's going to be really good.' I hated to be on the losing side of it but it's cool to be some part of history.\"\n\nThe similarities in their careers will draw comparisons between Strasburg and Skenes, especially the expediency of their rise to the majors after the dominance they displayed in the minors. Where Strasburg had 65 strikeouts against 13 walks in 55 1/3 innings over 11 starts at Double-A Harrisburg and Triple-A Syracuse in 2010, Skenes has 45 strikeouts against eight walks in 27 1/3 innings at Triple-A Indianapolis this season.\n\nThe Pirates are quick to warn that they offer differing styles of pitching, in terms of mechanics. Both are big right-handers capable of topping triple digits and buckling batters with breaking balls but, at 6-foot-6 \u00bd, 250 pounds, the 21-year-old Skenes already is bigger than Strasburg (6-5, 239) and has been clocked at 102 mph on the radar gun.\n\n\"He's unorthodox in a way to where he's a very big guy and uses his strength and power to throw the ball how he throws it,\" McCutchen said of Skenes. \"He has a very low release point, so his fastball is going to play up because of the way that it carries out of his hand. It's not the average righty fastball. He's throwing it from an angle that's down and he's pushing it so it's going to have this illusion where the ball is going up so that 100 is going to look a lot harder. He has a short stride. Strasburg had a very long stride. His release point was very far out there, so that gave the illusion of his 100 playing up.\"\n\nWhere Strasburg hit 100.1 with a four-seam fastball in the second inning of his debut, Skenes did so on four consecutive pitches in the first inning of his final start for Indianapolis this past Sunday. Skenes also showed a five-pitch repertoire, using a changeup, curveball, slider and splinker, a splitter-sinker hybrid.\n\n\"He's got so many pitches,\" Wehner said. \"We're talking 102 for seven innings in college. That's a whole other level. Strasburg was throwing 100 but I don't think I've ever heard of anybody as a starter maintaining 100. And we'll see if that is realistic throughout his career or this year, if (Skenes) can average 100 mph and touch 102, 103 as a starting pitcher.\"\n\nMcCutchen also believes Skenes has the mental makeup to handle adversity, given his two seasons as a two-way player at Air Force and the pressure of pitching as the Friday night starter in the SEC for LSU.\n\n\"I think the thing that stands out with him is not his stuff; I think it's the way he views his stuff, the way he views the type of pitcher that he is,\" McCutchen said. \"You can throw 100 but to be that confident in your stuff, that's a whole other side that some people have and some people don't. He has it. To be able to have that 100, that mindset is going to be good for him. It's just going to make his stuff play even better.\n\n\"I feel like he's going to deal with adversity fine because we all have to, no matter who you are. I think he's in a good spot mentally. Physically, obviously he's in a good spot. I don't see him doing anything different than what he's been doing thus far. He doesn't need to.\"\n\nWalker is more concerned with Skenes being compared to fellow Pirates rookie right-hander Jared Jones, who is off to an historic start. Jones has recorded at least seven strikeouts in six of his first seven starts, and had 10 in his debut on March 30 at the Miami Marlins and again on May 4 against the Colorado Rockies at PNC Park.\n\n\"I do think that it would be somewhat unfair to try to assume that he's going to do the exact same thing as Jared Jones,\" Walker said. \"I think that's how people are going to look at this. Regardless of what your arsenal is and how touted you are, first things first, if you don't throw strikes that's a major problem, no matter who you are or what team you're facing. You can throw 105 mph but if you're not throwing strikes... The main reason (Jones has) been so good is because he's throwing the ball over the plate.\"\n\nAfter seeing Strasburg's debut from the batter's box, Walker will watch Skenes' first start from the stands. He thought there was a chance Skenes could make his debut this weekend, so Walker bought tickets early and is taking his 7-year-old daughter to the Pirates-Cubs game on Saturday.\n\n\"Now, I'm sure the ticket market is going bananas,\" Walker said. \"It'll be exciting. It's going to be a much different experience as a fan, not being concerned about getting hits or playing defense or broadcasting.\n\n\"There was a lot of buildup, certainly, and I can remember a lot of hoopla around (Strasburg) as a high draft pick who is going to make a fairly immediate impact on the team. As players, you get so locked into the day to day that you're not really as concerned about who's on the mound but you're also very aware of when big-name guys come up. That Strasburg night was obviously a different type of night. People were all jacked up. I remember that day very well and the buzz around the stadium, which I'd imagine will be very similar on Saturday.\"", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"},

As CBS Sports recently detailed, Skenes has the potential to be an impact pitcher at the highest level. He has a nearly unmatched power arsenal that includes a triple-digit fastball, a swing-and-miss slider, and a newly minted sinker that pitch-classification algorithms confuse for a splitter.\n\nSkenes' arrival, combined with Jared Jones' continued existence, means the Pirates will now feature two of the most exciting young starters in the game. Though overshadowed in the Pirates farm system by Skenes for the past year, Jones has begun his big-league career in brilliant fashion. Over the course of seven starts, he has amassed a 2.63 ERA (153 ERA+) and a 10.40 strikeout-to-walk ratio. His contributions have already been worth an estimated 1.3 Wins Above Replacement.\n\nThe Skenes-Jones combination got us thinking about some of the game's other best young duos. In turn, we decided to rank what we consider to be the 10 best young starting pitcher combinations. To qualify, both pitchers had to be in the majors (or on the injured list) and have this season qualify as their age-25 campaign at most. (We concede that 25 is a completely arbitrary number, but it allowed us to get to 10 tandems.)\n\nBelow we've ranked our duos in order of descending quality. These rankings are based in part on what the pair has done in the majors, and in part on what we forecast them to do heading forward. This is, obviously, more of an art than a science. If we had to guess, most disagreements with our rankings will be based on the description versus prediction aspect, as well as us not penalizing elite performers for being paired with less-than-elite partners.\n\nWith all the fine print out of the way, let's get to it.\n\n1. Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Bobby Miller, Dodgers\n\nAfter a rough first start in MLB, Yamamoto has settled in and demonstrated why he won three consecutive MVP and Cy Young-equivalent Awards to close out his Nippon Professional Baseball career. He's sporting a 1.76 ERA over his last seven times out, and he's not allowed a single run in four of his eight appearances. Miller, meanwhile, is out with shoulder inflammation after tallying a 3.90 ERA (112 ERA+) and a 3.61 strikeout-to-walk ratio over his first 25 big-league starts.\n\n2. Spencer Strider and Bryce Elder, Braves\n\nIf we had performed this exercise last summer, Strider and Elder might've ranked No. 1. As it is, they'll have to settle for second place. (And we would understand anyone who feels the Braves should be lower on account of them being a very...let's say lopsided combination.) Make no mistake: this ranking is almost entirely because of Strider, an elite performer with an electric arm. Unfortunately, he's not going to be pitching anytime soon after undergoing elbow surgery. Elder, conversely, has seen diminishing returns on his smoke-and-mirrors show since making the 2023 All-Star Game. In 16 starts since, he's compiled an ERA north of 5.00.\n\n3. Paul Skenes and Jared Jones, Pirates\n\nSkenes is the only pitcher in this article who hasn't appeared in the majors, so this placement is all about our projection of him becoming a No. 2 starter or better. (Lest anyone get angry: we subscribe to the thinking that \"ace\" is a title that's earned, not given, and that there are at most a dozen pitchers worthy of it at a given time.) Jones has been outstanding, and would be the clear frontrunner for National League Rookie of the Year were it not for Shota Imanaga and Yoshinobu Yamamoto. Clearly these two have the potential to top this list sooner than later.\n\n4. Bryce Miller and Bryan Woo, Mariners\n\nMiller can lay claim to being one of the most underrated pitchers in the game. He gets overshadowed in the Mariners rotation, but he's a few starts away from clearing 200 career innings and he has a 102 ERA+ and a 4.13 strikeout-to-walk ratio. Not bad for a former fourth-round pick. Woo is closing in on returning from right elbow inflammation. He was surprisingly effective last season despite having one of the goofiest platoon splits you'll ever see over an 18-eight game stretch: he held right-handers to a .495 OPS while lefties torched him for a .928 OPS.\n\n5. Hunter Greene and Andrew Abbott, Reds\n\nGreene can surely relate to Skenes. He too was an early draft pick with a big arm and bigger expectations. Maybe Greene's career hasn't played out quite as the Reds hoped it would (even with a strong opening to this season, he's sporting a career 101 ERA+), but he's been an above-average starter and he's in the midst of his best season to date. Abbott has been a sensation since arriving last June. In his first 28 starts, he's tallied a 121 ERA+ and a 2.82 strikeout-to-walk ratio.\n\n6. Gavin Williams and Tanner Bibee, Guardians\n\nWith how well the Guardians have opened the season, you'd be within reason to think they're getting a lot of mileage from Williams, Bibee, and fellow young starter Logan Allen. Except they're not -- Williams hasn't pitched because of injury, and Bibee and Allen have thus far performed below replacement level. Go figure. We're not too concerned about any of the three over the long haul, as we think each of them should settle in as a mid-rotation starter or better.\n\n7. MacKenzie Gore and Mitchell Parker, Nationals\n\nThere was a time when it looked like Gore might not have a big-league career after developing the yips. Thankfully, those days are far behind him. He's been an above-average starter since joining the Nationals in the Juan Soto trade, punching out more than 10 batters per nine innings while walking fewer than four. Parker, a fellow southpaw, has performed well in his first five starts. We'd like to see more from him before we buy in fully, but he's done a great job of stair-stepping with a low-90s fastball, a curve, and a splitter that has generated an impressive 45.7% whiff rate.\n\n8. Taj Bradley and Shane Baz, Rays\n\nThis ranking is based entirely on potential. We believe better days await Bradley, who accumulated a 75 ERA+ last season despite striking out 11-plus batters per nine innings and showing above-average control. Baz, on the other hand, hasn't thrown a big-league pitch since 2022 because of elbow problems. He recently started a rehab assignment and could return later this month. If Bradley and Baz stay healthy, they're a good bet to outperform this ranking.\n\n9. Kyle Harrison and Mason Black, Giants\n\nThis is a top-heavy duo. Harrison is a former top prospect who has performed well in the bigs, racking up a 112 ERA+ and a 3.26 strikeout-to-walk ratio over his first 79 2/3 innings. Black just debuted last week. He's a low-slot right-hander who likes to spam the opposition with sweepers.\n\n10. Brandon Pfaadt and Slade Cecconi, Diamondbacks\n\nPfaadt hasn't maintained the momentum he enjoyed last October. He has, however, improved his ERA and his strikeout-to-walk ratio, in part because he's done a better job eliciting swings outside of the zone. Cecconi doesn't generate many chases or whiffs, but underlying metrics suggest he's performed better than his bloated ERA indicates. Stay tuned on that one.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_j_anderson@cbssports.com", "name": "R.J.

He has all the makings of a frontline starter, one who should not take very long to make his presence felt in Pittsburgh.\n\nSkenes helped LSU win the National Championship in 2023 as well, when they defeated Florida.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB_Network", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MLB Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Strasburg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Strasburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_Cole", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gerrit Cole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MLB.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Resources_and_Networking", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Resources and Networking", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Belief_Networks", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Belief Networks", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Installation", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Installation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2472,h_1390,x_0,y_87/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/fastball/01hxfsb5dwxejjx8wrcr.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547286", "eventUri": "eng-9547286", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 452992451, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 111, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 111}}}

Pittsburgh started the season 9-2 but is 8-19 over the next 27 games entering this three-game home stand against Chicago.\n\nThe Pirates rotation ranks 10th in ERA (3.70) and opponent batting average (.231), but the offense is 27th in batting average (.220) with the third-fewest homers hit (27). While Skenes won't be batting, he could be what the Pirates' fans and need to inject some excitement back into the team.\n\nThe 21-year-old pitcher 6-foot-6 RHP owns a 0.99 ERA with 45 strikeouts to eight walks over 27.1 innings and seven starts. The real hype around Skenes is his four-seam fastball that rivals Hunter Greene's of the Reds.\n\nSkenes averages 100 MPH on his fastball and throws it 46.9% of the time along with a slider that Triple-A batters are hitting .158 against. Throw in \"splinker\" which generates a swing and miss on 21% of pitches and reaches 97 MPH, and now you can see why he's supposed to be the next big thing in Pittsburgh.\n\nWith rookies Jared Jones and Paul Skenes now in the rotation, the youth movement has begun in Pittsburgh and it will include a lot of strikeouts. I played Skenes at +2300 to win NL Rookie of the Year back on April 19 and will run it back for another half-unit at +1700 on FanDuel for Skenes.\n\nBet the Edge is your source for the day in sports betting.

Before, it took you 30 to 45 minutes to drive from Emohua to this place, but look at it, less than 15 minutes we are here.\n\n\"So, it is about the people, the good of the people, making life easy for the people. That is the way I see governance. Anything outside that has nothing to do with me.\"\n\nPro-Wike Legislators Fret, Say Governor Plotting Another Demolition\n\nMeanwhile, members of the Rivers State House of Assembly loyal to the minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Nyesom Wike, have expressed discontent over the unscheduled visit of Governor Siminalayi Fubara to the House of Assembly quarters.\n\nAddressing journalists in Port Harcourt yesterday, the Speaker of the House, Rt. Hon. Martins Amaewhule, said Fubara's visit may not be unconnected with his plot to demolish the quarters just as he demolished the House of Assembly complex.\n\nAmaewhule said: \"Rivers people were stunned this afternoon when they got the information that the governor of Rivers State stormed the Rivers State House of Assembly quarters. It is yet another attempt to demolish the Rivers State House of Assembly quarters the same way he demolished the Rivers State House of Assembly complex.\n\n\"Nigerians and Rivers people have been watching events day-by-day as our own governor, who is supposed to uphold the Constitution, is gradually sliding into the position of chief law breaker of Nigeria. Our governor demolished the House of Assembly complex and plans are on the way, as we can see, to demolish the Rivers State House of Assembly quarters.\"\n\nAccording to the Speaker, the quarters, built by the past administration of Nyesom Wike and commissioned in year 2022, is one of the best in the country.\n\nHe said, \"There is nothing wrong with any of the buildings; all the buildings are in perfect condition, our hall is in perfect condition. We have no issues and we have not called the governor for any kind of help. The Rivers State House of Assembly quarters was built for the Rivers State House of Assembly and not for the executive arm of government.\n\n\"The undue interference of the governor is unbecoming of a sitting governor, who is supposed to uphold the sanctity of the law. We are disappointed. We are ashamed to have a governor who has no respect for our constitution, who has no respect for our laws, who has no respect for democracy. Day-by-day, the governor executes actions that are against democracy.\"", "source": {"uri": "leadership.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Leadership"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anayo_onukwugha@leadership.ng", "name": "Anayo Onukwugha", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "House of Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Harcourt", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Port Harcourt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Port Harcourt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siminalayi_Fubara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siminalayi Fubara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Rivers_State_House_of_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivers_State_House_of_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rivers State House of Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emohua", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emohua"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Emohua"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyesom_Wike", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nyesom Wike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martins_Amaewhule", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martins Amaewhule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Rivers_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Rivers State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Capital_Territory,_Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-09-235854.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554236", "eventUri": "eng-9554236", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 452992049, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 19, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 19}}}

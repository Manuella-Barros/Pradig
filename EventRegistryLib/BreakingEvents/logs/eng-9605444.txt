His move to Columbus also coincides with John Davidson shifting into an advisory role after running the front office for 10 of the past 12 years. \"Don Waddell is one of the most experienced and respected executives in our sport with over four decades of experience as a player, scout, head coach, general manager and team president,\"\u009d team President Mike Priest said. \"Don has every attribute we were looking for when this process began, and we are thrilled to have him lead our hockey operations efforts.\"\u009d The Hurricanes reached the playoffs and won at least one series in each of Waddell's six seasons in charge. The Blue Jackets have missed the playoffs in each of the past four seasons and have made three different coaching hires during that time. \"To our fans, we remain committed to providing all the necessary resources to build a team and organization that competes for the Stanley Cup,\"\u009d majority owner John P. McConnell said. \"After spending time getting to know Don, I believe his experience and leadership will take us down the path to success.\"\u009d Waddell, 65, has a Stanley Cup ring from 1998 when he was assistant GM of the Detroit Red Wings. He became the first GM of the expansion Atlanta Thrashers and spent more than a decade in that job before scouting for the Pittsburgh Penguins, then going to Carolina as president. \"I've known Don for many years, and he is one of the great gentlemen in our business,\"\u009d Davidson said. \"He is a very smart, dedicated professional who has shown a great ability to bring people together to work toward a common goal and achieve success.\" Waddell succeeds Jarmo Kekalainen in the full-time role after Davidson made a midseason change and took over GM duties on an interim basis. Waddell said the organization \"has everything you need to have success at the highest level.\"\u009d The Blue Jackets in 23 seasons of existence have made the playoffs just six times and never gotten past the second round. Within the past year, Brad Larsen was fired as coach after two seasons, Mike Babcock was hired and then forced to resign on the eve of training camp after players voiced privacy concerns about his methods and then replaced by Pascal Vincent, who oversaw a team that lost 55 of its 82 games. ___ AP NHL:", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@medicinehatnews.com", "name": "Canadian Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Davidson_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Davidson (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Waddell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Don Waddell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Hurricanes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Hurricanes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Blue_Jackets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbus Blue Jackets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Babcock", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Babcock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Larsen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brad Larsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarmo_Kek\u00e4l\u00e4inen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarmo Kek\u00e4l\u00e4inen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Thrashers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Thrashers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Penguins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Red_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Red Wings"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://medicinehatnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cp/20240524120544-6650c464167b340b8759fa24jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605444", "eventUri": "eng-9605444", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-05-08", "textStart": 110, "textEnd": 121}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 231, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, it appears Don Waddell is taking a job with the Columbus Blue Jackets. Is someone from Edmonton set to join him when the Oilers' playoff run is over? The Winnipeg Jets have hired Scott Arniel as their head coach. Finally, the New York Islanders and Chicago Blackhawks completed a trade for draft picks on Friday. Are the Islanders up to something?\n\nElliotte Friedman mentioned that Carolina Hurricanes forward Martin Necas was discussed in a reported trade deadline deal for Elias Pettersson involving Carolina and Vancouver. He noted that with all of the speculation currently surrounding Necas, the Canucks could circle back. Friedman said, \"And the (Martin) Necas one is a big one. And you know I got a call this morning. I think there's something to this, and I'm sure they're not the only one but I think there's something to Vancouver. I do. I think that, I think the Canucks like the player.\"\n\nThere was also talk that maybe the Hurricanes would target Filip Hronek since the Hurricanes will need defense. Hronek had a contentious end-of-season media avail and some believe he's not interested in staying in Vancouver long-term.\n\nRick Dhaliwal reported that he was told the Canucks are very serious about Martin Necas. \"Lots of teams are poking around, inquiring to see what it would take. I believe the Canucks have obviously called. I also was told this morning the Canucks are very serious.\"\n\nRelated: 2024 Stanley Cup Playoffs Conference Finals Hub\n\nThe Canucks have also parted ways with Jeremy Colliton and hired Manny Malhotra as the new head coach in Abbotsford. Colliton got his wish to pursue NHL opportunities.\n\nDon Waddell leaving Carolina is of his own doing, according to a report by Andy Strickland. He adds, \"...even if he was asked to return, he would have walked. According to sources.\" The reason seems to be that he's taking the job as President of Hockey Ops in Columbus where it appears Waddell will get total control of the roster.\n\nPierre LeBrun reports, \"Nothing is finalized yet but hearing that Don Waddell is the Blue Jackets' choice to take over the top hockey ops job in Columbus. If things proceed smoothly, should see an announcement over the coming week.\" Darren Dreger adds:\n\n\"I was told it was almost there yesterday. Likely the holiday weekend holding up the contract work. Will be interesting to see how long Waddell oversees Hockey Ops and acts as GM in CBJ. Big jobs. No decisions on that front until the conclusion of the playoffs at the very earliest.\"\n\nJimmy Murphy then noted he's hearing the same thing about Waddell in Columbus, but also noted that Edmonton might be a team to watch here as Ken Holland is being considered for the GM job with the Blue Jackets. Is Murphy suggesting that both Holland and Waddell could wind up in Columbus working together?\n\nThe Winnipeg Jets have hired Scott Arniel as their new head coach. Darren Dreger reports that Winnipeg conducted interviews with top candidates although Arniel was considered a frontrunner going into the process. He adds, \"Arniel is well respected by the players and has earned another shot at being an NHL head coach.\"\n\nIn a trade on Friday, the Islanders acquired a first-round pick (#20) and two second-round picks (#54 and #61) from the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for their first-round pick (#18) and second-round pick (#50). The Islanders essentially paid a second-round pick to move up just two spots in the first round and four spots in the second round. Why?\n\nMany believe this is a precursor to another move coming from the Islanders in which a second-round pick might be required to make a deal. It's possible the Islanders are just stockpiling picks, but another theory is that the Islanders might use the extra second-rounder to offload a bad contract.", "source": {"uri":

Don has every attribute we were looking for when this process began, and we are thrilled to have him lead our hockey operations efforts.\"\n\nWaddell began his NHL career in 1997-98 and won a Stanley Cup championship as an assistant general manager with the Detroit Red Wings. The following year, he joined the expansion Atlanta Thrashers as vice president of hockey operations and general manager and would serve in that role until 2010 when he was named team president. He also served as executive vice president and co-chair of the executive committee of the Atlanta Spirit, the parent company of the Thrashers, the National Basketball Association's Atlanta Hawks and Philips Arena. He then had a three-year stint as a consultant and pro scout with the Pittsburgh Penguins before arriving in Carolina in 2014.\n\n\"I've known Don for many years, and he is one of the great gentlemen in our business,\" said Davidson. \"He is a very smart, dedicated professional who has shown a great ability to bring people together to work towards a common goal and achieve success. I believe this is a great day for our organization and our fans.\"\n\nThe Detroit, Michigan native also has served in several capacities with USA Hockey during his career. In 2013, he was named international consultant with a special focus on player identification and interface with the U.S. National Junior Team and USA Hockey's National Team Development Program. He served as general manager for Team USA at the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Torino, Italy, and at the 2001, 2002 and 2005 International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) World Championships. As a player, he helped Team USA to the gold medal at the 1983 IIHF World Championships.\n\n\"I couldn't be more excited to join the Columbus Blue Jackets as this is an organization that has everything you need to have success at the highest level,\" said Waddell. \"It's a wonderful city with passionate fans, strong ownership, first-class facilities, and a desire to be the best. I'd like to thank the McConnell family, Mike Priest and John Davidson for this opportunity, and look forward to being part of this community.\"\n\nPrior to embarking on his NHL management career, Waddell spent a decade as executive vice president and general manager of International Hockey League (IHL) franchises in San Diego (1990-95) and Orlando (1995-97) and was twice named IHL Executive of the Year (1992-93, 1995-96). In Orlando, he was vice president of RDV Sports and served on the executive committee that oversaw the NBA's Orlando Magic, the IHL's Orlando Solar Bears and the company's retail and aviation interests.\n\nWaddell played four seasons of Division I collegiate hockey as a defenseman and majored in business management at Northern Michigan University from 1976-80. He was a seventh-round pick of the Los Angeles Kings at the 1978 NHL Draft and spent three years with the organization. He went on to play parts of nine seasons as a professional, mostly in the IHL. He also served as head coach of the IHL's San Diego Gulls in 1991-92 and was interim head coach of the Thrashers on two occasions (2002-03, 2007-08) during his tenure with the club.", "source":

They said there was going to be a full-time search. I had heard that in the last couple of days that there was going to be a full-time search Tulsky was not going to just be handed the job.\n\nBut you know, it's going to be interesting there. I mean, Tulsky has, has a big say, in all decisions. Dundon really trust him. I don't really understand why Dundon would, would not just promote him and bolster around him. But I'm sure at some point, I mean, maybe he, maybe he goes through a search, and he does end up getting it. That wouldn't be the first time that's happened before.\n\nBut that, you know, they have a good staff like they're smart people. They're like, they've got Darren Yorke, Aaron Schwartz.

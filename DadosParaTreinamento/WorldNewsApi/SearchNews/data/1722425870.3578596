That doesn't exactly roll off the tongue as well, but The Boys star Chace Crawford thinks he should be credited with rocking the trendy early '00s hairstyle first \u2014 even before Justin Bieber or Zac Efron. Crawford made his wild claim during Wednesday's episode of Watch What Happens Live while looking back on some of his most regrettable fashion choices from that era. He was game to admit that most of his looks were trash, but he had a point to make about his hair. \"I know, it's so bad,\" Crawford said when Andy Cohen pointed out his \"Bieber hairdo,\" but he went from being embarrassed about it to wanting credit for it real quick. \"I think I was the first one though, no? I was. And before Efron, yeah. I was the first one. OG mop!\" Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more. Because Crawford fought so hard in claiming he originated the infamous shaggy hairdo, Cohen declared he could \"keep this one\" as fashion, unlike most of his other early aughts looks. The actor playfully went through a lot of red carpet photos from his past, calling out his \"trash\" Affliction shirt, \"weird Twilight vibe,\" pageboy hat, mini vest, and more. \"This is before actors used stylists,\" he said. \"I look like Pinocchio.\" Watch Crawford's entire \"Fashion or Trash, hun\" segment below: Crawford can currently be seen in The Boys season 4 as depraved superhero The Deep, who is in a romantic relationship with an octopus \u2014 Oscar-winner Tilda Swinton voices his cephalopod wife. \"Once we decided we were going to have Deep have regular conversation with his octopus wife, we just wanted the biggest, classiest, British Oscar-winning actress we could possibly find,\" showrunner Eric Kripke told EW. \"That's a reasonably short list. We didn't know Tilda. It's not like some of our other cameos where they're friends of friends and we reach out to them. We just reached out to a rep and sent her the script. To her everlasting credit, her rep was like, 'She loves this and thinks it's hilarious and would love to do it.'\" The executive producer recalled how Swinton came in for one day of recording to bring the part to life. \"Watching the classiest possible actress record the dumbest possible s--- was one of the great professional days of my life,\" he added.
